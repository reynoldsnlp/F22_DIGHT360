# DIGHT 360, Fall 2022, BYU
Text Processing and Analysis (using Python!)

The syllabus and assignments are on
[Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu).

## Textbook(s)

There are many amazing, free resources available on the internet. I will assign
a topic with suggested readings from a variety of resources throughout the
semester, but I also expect you to explore some on your own, and report back to
class if you find something that is especially helpful. That said, below I have
compiled a list of useful textbooks and websites that you may want to consider
using.

1. Everything on safaribooksonline.com, but especially...
    * Python crash course
    * Learning Python
    * Introduction to python (Jessica McKellar)
    * Learn Python 3 the hard way
    * Automate the boring stuff with python
    * Introducing python
    * Python for beginners
    * Python programming language (David Beazley)
    * Think python
    * python in a nutshell

## Some useful special-purpose tools

### Regular expressions

* [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) is a useful resource for learning or
  debugging regular expressions in python (make sure you click on the `python`
  flavor).
* [Pythex](http://pythex.org) is a similar tool, and it has a great cheatsheet
  if you click the button at the bottom of the page.

### Code formatting (PEP8)

In this course, I will do my best to teach you to write code that is easy for
other programmers to read, especially focusing on the [PEP8
standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Most modern IDEs (VSCode,
PyCharm, Atom, etc.) include code formatting linter plugins. From the command
line, you can check your code formatting using
[flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8).  You can also check code
formatting online at [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/).

## Online python interpreters and shells/REPLs

* https://www.python.org/shell/ (python REPL)
* https://www.pythonanywhere.com (python script and REPL, bash REPL)
* https://colab.research.google.com (python notebooks)
* https://kaggle.com (python scripts OR python notebooks)
* https://gradient.paperspace.com (python notebooks (jupyterlab))

## Step by step code walkthrough

If you are ever confused about a piece of code and wonder what it is doing,
your IDE most likely has a "debugger". There are also online resources like
the [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) that can
walk you through step by step to show what each line does.
