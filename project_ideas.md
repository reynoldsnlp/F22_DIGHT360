# Ideas for final projects

## General strategies

* Think of linguistic/social/religious/educational/scientific questions that interest you.
* Ask professors you know if they have any text processing projects that might be helpful to them.
* Think about online communities you belong to, websites you like to visit, or other hobbies.

## Corpora

You can use existing corpora or you can create your own corpus. Your corpus
does not need to be in English! Here are some possibilities to consider:

* Literature (especially public domain, to avoid copyright problems)
* Twitter (Many tools exist to scrape tweets)
* Political corpora (congressional bills, campaign websites, political action committee websites, etc.)
* Religious texts (scriptures, devotionals, General Conference, etc.)
* Wikipedia (dumps can be downloaded)
* Games
* Recipes
* Anything on the [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/)

## Analysis methods

* Word frequency analysis
* Grammatical analysis (part-of-speech, syntactic dependencies, etc.)
* Machine-learning classifier
* Sentiment analysis (especially effective with tweets, reviews, etc.)
* Topic modeling (automatically group documents according to their topics)

## Visualizations

These obviously depend on what kind of analysis you perform.

* Scatter plot
* Box plot
* Line plot
* Histogram
* Etc.
