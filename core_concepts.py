"""Core concepts quiz

STEP 1: Complete the quiz WITHOUT USING ANY RESOURCES.
STEP 2: Go back and revise your answers using any resource EXCEPT other humans.

Add a comment to the end of every line of code to explain what it is doing. Be
VERY detailed in your explanations. (It's okay if the lines are too long for
PEP8.)

Where you see comments beginning with TODO, add/change the code to complete
the feature described in the comment. Then delete the TODO comment.
