<p> It's a kind of magic It's a kind of magic A kind of magic - no way One dream, one soul, one prize One goal, one golden glance of what should be It's a kind of magic One shaft of light that shows the way No mortal man can win this day It's a kind of magic The bell that rings inside your mind Is challenging the doors of time It's a kind of magic The waiting seems eternity The day will dawn of sanity Ooh ooh ooh ooh Is this a kind of magic? It's a kind of magic There can be only one This rage that lasts a thousand years Will soon be done This flame that burns inside of me I'm hearing secret harmonies It's a kind of magic The bell that rings inside your mind Is challenging the doors of time It's a kind of magic It's a kind of magic This rage that lasts a thousand years Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah) There can be only one one one one This rage that lasts a thousand years Will soon be done - done Magic - it's a kind of magic It's a kind of magic Magic magic magic (magic) Ha ha ha haa - it's magic Ha haa Yeah yeah Wooh It's a kind of magic

<p> General Comment: "The bell that rings inside your mind is challenging the doors of time" A reference to the Quickening, the "magic" that makes the Highlander immortal and alerts him when others like himself are nearby.
<p> General Comment: Some of the lyrics fit with the theme of Highlander, but a lot don't and I think the genesis of the lyrics come from a world wide craze from the early 80's - 'Masquerade' a book by Kit Williams, it was a treasure hunt for a golden hare that he had buried somewhere in Britain. If you think about the lyrics they match this concept better than they do the theme of highlander:
<p> One dream one soul one prize one goal - Lots of people had a common dream of finding the hare but only one person (soul) could.
<p> One golden glance of what should be - The hare was made of gold.
<p> One shaft of light that shows the way - the solution to the riddle used the sun at midday on the equinox to locate the hare!
<p> No mortal man can win this day - the winner would become immortal in as much as people would remember them.
<p> The bell that rings inside your mind - that 'ah ha' moment when you figure it out.
<p> Is challenging the doors of time The waiting seems eternity - It seemed impossible to solve but was eventually unearthed 2.5 years after its burial.
<p> The day will dawn of sanity - Eventually it will be solved and the madness will end.
<p> There can be only one - winner.
<p> This rage that lasts a thousand years - it seemed like the madness it generated might last 1,000 years.
<p> Will soon be done - hope it gets solved soon.
<p> This flame that burns inside of me - the passion that alot of people had trying to solves the riddle.
<p> I'm here in secret harmonies - picking out the meaningful things from the red herrings.
<p> General Comment: Personally, I think this was written for Highlander. I mean, come on... 'One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal...No mortal man can win this day...There can be only one...This rage that lasts a thousand years' if that doesn't sound like Highlander I don't know what does.
<p> General Comment: I actually like the live version much better. The studio one is alright and I'm not a fan of all their videos. You kind of feel cheated buying greatest video hits II when a few of the videos only feature queen performing the song. (i.e. friends will be friends, i want it all, one vision)
<p> General Comment: it seems to me...others may disagree....that this is one song that soundedd good only at the studio......it sunds great.....even though they played great live...this song never quite had the same feeling live.....the Music Video was really good....but it didn't sound as good at Wembley....even though it was live and bold....it just didn't have that oomph to it.
<p> General Comment: Pretty cool song but for some reason, the book in the triple platinum collection states that the single was a worldwide smash hit and topped the charts in no less than 35 countries. Interestingly, it peaked only at number 3 in the band's native UK and it hasn't been confirmed what 35 countries the song went to number 1 in. In fact, not one country has been confirmed. Perhaps it was 35 schools?
