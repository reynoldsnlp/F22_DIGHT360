<h> Book Description
<p> So, you're still rubbing those sore spots from a previous relationship.  This time, you promise yourself, everything is going to be different.  The problem? When it comes to relationships, you've been an idiot .
<p> You may have read books on relationships, but you haven't read a book like this one.
<p> "When It Comes To Relationships" serves up the unique, hilarious, and enlightening perspective of Internet icon Dr. Matt.  There's no men from Mars, or women from Venus, but who needs planets to explore relationship differences when you have Dr. Matt and his partner Midgie?
<p> Despite his assurance that this book won't be about himself or his partner, and his insistence that he "hates metaphors", Dr. Matt uses every tool in the tool shed to pull apart and piece together relationships, and possibly ends up learning something about his own in the process.
<p> With allegories of the story of Adam and Eve to plot points of The Matrix , "When It Comes To Relationships" shows us how we've all acted like idiots at one time or another.

<h> Editorial Reviews
<h> About the Author
<p> Dr. Matt is a world-famous author and all-around amazing person. If you haven't heard of him, then you may need to start by asking yourself, "Self, what have I been doing with my time? Why have I even been alive? "
<p> Then, you're going to want to pick up a phone and call all your friends.
<p> Frantically, you'll begin Googling online, getting the sinking feeling that the most amazing phenomenon in the history of mankind has begun and you nearly missed out .
<p> Finally, Google will begin to give you hope. Links to podcasts, blogs, books, videos, Facebook pages, and Twitter feeds will begin to appear, with the reassuring mustached image of Dr. Matt. A ray of sunshine will emerge from the clouds and fall upon your face.
<p> All hail Dr. Matt, The Most Famous Fake Doctor Of Our Time, for he has done the impossible; he's cured everyone, everywhere of their relationship problems! Yes, that's right, in plain, easy-to-understand language, he's identified everything that you do wrong in your relationships and told you exactly how to fix it. All without even knowing who you are!
<p> Impossible, you say? Don't be ridiculous! It's all right here contained within this book. Not to spoil anything, but according to Dr. Matt, (The Most Famous Fake Doctor Of Our Time, don't forget) relationships are a bridge. And he tells us exactly how to build the bridge. And how to maintain it. Even how to dismantle it without hurting anyone. Simply put, it's amazing!
<p> But wait, there's more! Did I mention it's laugh-out-loud hilarious? I can't count the number of times I nearly spewed my Mountain Dew on my keyboard. At least five different times, possibly even more! And that's not even counting the time my daughter snuck up on my with my headphones on and tapped me on the back of the shoulder.
<p> But back to the point at hand. The review proper. Here it goes: You owe it to yourself to buy this book. Even if you think you already have a perfect relationship, chances are you'll learn something that will strengthen it even further. Plus you'll laugh quite a bit along the way. And hell, you might even learn something about yourself by the time you're finished. I know I did. And that, my friends, is a miracle.
<p> Are you having trouble in your relationships? As for myself I have to answer truthfully, not at all. Typically, I wouldn't have felt any interest in reading this book, but a friend passed it to me because he thought I'd get a laugh out of it. He was right about that - this thing is funny. The author has an unusual sense of humor in that he proclaims his ultimate superiority while in the same breath he pokes fun at his own "fake doctorate." The content is filled with "Dr. Matt's" whimsical examples of his advice-giving sessions in which "patients" are confronted with superior wisdom. These folks suddenly find their misconceptions of what it means to be in a relationship dissolved by way of simple straightforward, even blunt, advice. For all that, in light of this tongue-in-cheek style the advice is indeed solid. It's a good read. For people like myself who can at least remember what it was like to be deeply confused, it's a good reminder. It never hurts anyone to be reminded that in order to love another we first need to love ourselves. Thanks to the author!
<p> Dr. Matt may be a fake doctor (in fact the "most famous fake doctor of our time"), but there is absolutely nothing fake about the quality of advice and insight he shares in this remarkable little book. With a delightful, sometimes wicked, sense of humour, Dr. Matt addresses issues around dating, flirting, sex, communication and control. He discusses why we have relationships, the importance of intimacy and the challenges of breaking up. I bought this book not really knowing what to expect and figuring that it would be a great comedic piece of light reading. Little did I know that I would find brilliant gems of Truth tucked neatly between a whole lot of laughs. I recommend giving it to your friends and loved ones. Granted, they may at first be a bit taken aback by the title, but trust me, once they read it, they will thank you! And while you're at it, buy a copy for yourself, because "When it comes to Relationships, You've been an IDIOT!" too.
