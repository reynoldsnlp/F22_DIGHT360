<h> What Kind Of A Girl (do You Think I Am) Lyrics - Norma Jean
<p> You want me to prove my love for you But I'm surprised that the way you're asking me to You've known me so long I can't understand what kind of a girl do you think I am What kind of a girl do you want for a wife Do you want a girl who knows that much about life Well if that's what you want take me out of your plans What kind of a girl do you think I am [ steel ] What kind of a girl would do the things you're askin' me to without wedding rings Is it what you must do to prove you're a man what kind of a girl do you think I am What kind of a girl... What kind of a girl do you think I am
