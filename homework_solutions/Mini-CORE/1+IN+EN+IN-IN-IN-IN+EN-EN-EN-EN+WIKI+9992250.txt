<p> With a combined population of over 500million inhabitants, [ 22 ] or 7.3% of the world population, [ 23 ] the EU in 2012 generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of 16.584 trillion US dollars, constituting approximately 23% of global nominal GDP and 20% when measured in terms of purchasing power parity , which is the largest economy by nominal GDP and the second largest economy by GDP (PPP) in the world. [ 24 ] In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . [ 25 ]
<p> The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The executives of the new communities were called Commissions, as opposed to the "High Authority". The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein ( Hallstein Commission ) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand ( Armand Commission ) and then tienne Hirsch . Euratom would integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union between members. [ 30 ] [ 31 ]
<p> Throughout the 1960s, tensions began to show with France seeking to limit supranational power. However, in 1965, an agreement was reached and hence in 1967, the Merger Treaty was signed in Brussels. It came into force on 1 July 1967 and created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities (EC), although commonly just as the European Community . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission ( Rey Commission ). [ 34 ]
<h> Geography
<p> The EU's member states cover an area of 4,423,147 square kilometres (1,707,787sqmi). [ c ] The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps , 4,810.45 metres (15,782ft) above sea level . [ 48 ] The lowest point in the EU is Zuidplaspolder in the Netherlands , at 7m (23ft) below sea level. The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006mi) long.
<p> Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside of the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic (North-East Europe) to tropical (French Guyana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate maritime climate (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a Mediterranean climate (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate (Northern Balkans and Central Europe). [ 49 ]
<p> The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in seven member states by 2020) living in urban areas. Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a large grouping in and around the Benelux . An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. In some cases, this urban growth has been due to the influx of EU funds into a region. [ 50 ]
<p> Through successive enlargements , the Union has grown from the six founding states - Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands - to the current 28. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties , thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty". [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
<p> To become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria , defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law ; a functioning market economy ; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council. [ 55 ] No member state has ever left the Union, although Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985. [ 56 ] The Lisbon Treaty now contains a clause providing for a member to leave the EU. [ 57 ]
<h> Politics
<p> The EU operates within those competencies conferred on it by the treaties and according to the principle of subsidiarity (which dictates that action by the EU should only be taken where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures and those which specifically require national implementation measures. [ 63 ]
<h> Constitutional nature
<p> The classification of the European Union in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated, often in the light of the degree of integration that is perceived, desired, or expected. Historically, at least, the EU is an international organisation, and by some criteria, it could be classified as a confederation ; but it also has many attributes of a federation, so some would classify it as a ( de facto ) federation of states. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] For this reason, the organisation has, in the past, been termed sui generis (incomparable, one of a kind), though it is also argued that this designation is no longer true. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
<p> The organisation itself has traditionally used the terms "community", and later "union". The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law (where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations) and international law (where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations); they can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions. [ 67 ] Especially in terms of the European constitutional tradition, the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federal state or federation -at least, not without qualification. Though not, strictly, a federation, it is more than a free-trade association. [ 69 ] It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature. Walter Hallstein, in the original German edition of Europe in the Making called it "an unfinished federal state". [ 70 ] The German Constitutional Court refers to the European Union as an association of sovereign states and affirms that making the EU a federation would require replacement of the German constitution. [ 71 ] Others claim that it will not develop into a federal state but has reached maturity as an international organisation. [ 72 ]
<p> The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a "collective head of state " and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties). [ 74 ]
<p> On 19 November 2009, Herman Van Rompuy was chosen as the first permanent President of the European Council . On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force and he assumed office. Ensuring the external representation of the EU, [ 75 ] driving consensus and settling divergences among members are tasks for the President both during the convocations of the European Council and in the time periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe , an international organisation independent from the EU.
<p> The Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure . This also applies to the EU budget . Finally, the Commission is accountable to Parliament, requiring its approval to take office, having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it. The President of the European Parliament carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally. The EP President and Vice-Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years. [ 78 ]
<p> The EU had an agreed budget of 120.7billion for the year 2007 and 864.3billion for the period 2007-2013, [ 83 ] representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's GNI forecast for the respective periods. By comparison, the United Kingdom's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be 759billion, and France was estimated to have spent 801billion. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03% of GDP. [ 84 ]
<p> In the 2010 budget of 141.5billion, the largest single expenditure item is " cohesion & competitiveness " with around 45% of the total budget. [ 85 ] Next comes " agriculture " with approximately 31% of the total. [ 85 ] " Rural development, environment and fisheries " takes up around 11%. [ 85 ] " Administration " accounts for around 6%. [ 85 ] The " EU as a global partner " and " citizenship, freedom, security and justice " bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively. [ 85 ]
<p> The Court of Auditors aims to ensure that the budget of the European Union has been properly accounted for. The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and the European Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. [ 86 ]
<p> The Court of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with "a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions". [ 87 ] The Court has refused to do so every year since 1993, qualifying their report of the Union's accounts every year since then. [ 88 ] In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund , were materially affected by error. [ 89 ] The European Commission estimated [ when? ] that the financial impact of irregularities was 1,863million. [ 90 ]
<h> Competences
<p> EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws. [ 91 ]
<p> That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.
<p> The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:
<h> Legal system
<p> The last amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU came into force in 2009 and was the Lisbon Treaty .
<p> The EU is based on a series of treaties . These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties. [ 92 ] These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation [ f ] which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants. [ g ] The EU has legal personality , with the right to sign agreements and international treaties. [ 93 ]
<p> Under the principle of supremacy , national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions. [ h ]
<p> The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and cases referred to it by the courts of member states. [ 95 ] The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts, [ 96 ] and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service . [ 97 ] Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law. [ 98 ]
<h> Fundamental rights
<p> The awarding ceremony of the 1990 Sakharov Prize awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi (here by Martin Schulz ) inside the Parliament's Strasbourg hemicycle, in 2013. Suu Kyi could not collect it before as she had been political prisoner for years.
<p> The treaties declare that the EU itself is "founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy, equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail." [ 99 ]
<p> In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states." [ 100 ] The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights. [ 101 ] The Charter of Fundamental Rights was drawn up in 2000. Although originally not legally binding the Charter was frequently cited by the EU's courts as encapsulating rights which the courts had long recognised as the fundamental principles of EU law. Although signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership, [ i ] previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state [ j ] nor had the competence to accede. [ k ] The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.
<h> Acts
<p> The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: regulations , directives , and decisions . Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures, [ l ] and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. [ f ] Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states. [ m ] When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states.
<p> Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law , or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy. [ 103 ]
<h> Justice and home affairs
<p> Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: Europol for co-operation of police forces, [ 104 ] Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors, [ 105 ] and Frontex for co-operation between border control authorities. [ 106 ] The EU also operates the Schengen Information System [ 17 ] which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime.
<p> Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition, [ 107 ] family law, [ 108 ] asylum law, [ 109 ] and criminal justice. [ 110 ] Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. [ n ] In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation. [ o ] By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place, age discrimination , and racial discrimination . [ p ]

<p> Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common Commercial policy . [ 111 ] Steps for a more wide ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act . EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty . [ 112 ]
<p> The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. [ 113 ] The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq [ 114 ]
<p> Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement . The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries. [ 118 ] This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as " soft power ", as opposed to military "hard power". [ 119 ]
<h> Military
<p> The European Union does not have one unified military. The predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a strong military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes. [ 120 ] 22 EU members are members of NATO [ 121 ] while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality . [ 122 ] The Western European Union , a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the EU. [ 123 ]
<p> According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), France spent more than 44 billion ($59bn) on defence in 2010, placing it third in the world after the US and China, while the United Kingdom spent almost 38 billion ($58bn), the fourth largest. [ 124 ] Together, France and the United Kingdom account for 45 per cent of Europe's defence budget, 50 per cent of its military capacity and 70 per cent of all spending in military research and development. [ 125 ] Britain and France are also officially recognised nuclear weapon states and are the only two European nations to hold permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council . In 2000, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany accounted for 97% of the total military research budget of the then 15 EU member states. [ 126 ]
<p> Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500personnel. [ 127 ]
<p> Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30%). [ 132 ] The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments. [ 132 ] The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, 16.9 billion, 2007-2013), which must spend 95% of its budget on overseas development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes. [ 132 ] The European Development Fund (EDF, 22.7 bn, 2008-2013) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states, but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7% target and allow the European Parliament greater oversight. [ 132 ]
<p> The EU's aid has previously been criticised by the think-tank Open Europe for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives. [ 133 ] Clare Short , former British International Development Secretary , said the European Commission ran 'the worst development agency in the world' and branded its operations 'an outrage and a disgrace'. [ 134 ] Furthermore, some charities such as ActionAid have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. Under the de-inflated figures, the EU as a whole did not reach its internal aid target in 2006 [ 135 ] and is expected not to reach the international target of 0.7% of gross national income until 2015. [ 136 ]
<p> However, four countries have reached the 0.7% target: Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Denmark. [ 137 ] In 2011, EU aid was 0.42% of the EU's GNI making it the world's most generous aid donor. [ 138 ] The previous Commissioner for Aid , Louis Michel , has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect, and on humanitarian principles. [ 139 ]
<h> Economy
<p> Gross domestic product (GDP) per inhabitant, in purchasing power standard (PPS) in EU regions in 2009
<p> The EU has established a single market across the territory of all its members. 17 member states have also joined a monetary union known as the eurozone , which uses the Euro as a single currency. [ 140 ] In 2012, the EU had a combined GDP of 16.073 trillions international dollars , a 20% share of the global gross domestic product (in terms of purchasing power parity). [ 24 ] According to Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2012 (September), the EU owns the largest net wealth in the world; it is estimated to equal 30% of the $223 trillion global wealth.
<p> Of the top 500 largest corporations measured by revenue ( Fortune Global 500 in 2010), 161 have their headquarters in the EU. [ 141 ] In 2007, unemployment in the EU stood at 7% [ 142 ] while investment was at 21.4% of GDP, inflation at 2.2%, and current account balance at ?0.9% of GDP (i.e., slightly more import than export). In 2012, unemployment in the EU stood, per August 2012, at 11.4% [ 142 ]
<p> There is a significant variance for GDP (PPP) per capita within individual EU states, these range from 11,300 to 69,800 (about US$15,700 to US$97,000). [ 146 ] The difference between the richest and poorest regions (271 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics ) ranged, in 2009, from 27% of the EU27 average in the region of Severozapaden in Bulgaria, to 332% of the average in Inner London in the United Kingdom. On the high end, Inner London has 78,000 PPP per capita, Luxembourg 62,500, and Bruxelles-Cap 52,500, while the poorest regions, are Severozapaden with 6,400 PPP per capita, Nord-Est with 6,900 PPP per capita, Severen tsentralen with 6,900 and Yuzhen tsentralen with 7,200. [ 146 ]
<p> Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries. [ 151 ] Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.
<p> The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states. [ 152 ]
<p> The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60-70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services. [ 153 ] According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.
<h> Competition
<p> The EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market. [ q ] The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues, approving mergers , breaking up cartels, working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid . [ 154 ]
<p> The Competition Commissioner , currently Joaqun Almunia , is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations. [ 155 ] For example, in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States ( GE and Honeywell ) which had already been approved by their national authority. [ 156 ] Another high-profile case against Microsoft , resulted in the Commission fining Microsoft over 777million following nine years of legal action. [ 157 ]
<p> The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. However, it was only with the advent of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 that member states were legally bound to start the monetary union no later than 1 January 1999. On this date the euro was duly launched by eleven of the then 15 member states of the EU. It remained an accounting currency until 1 January 2002, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 18 countries, the most recent being Latvia which joined on 1 January 2014.
<p> All other EU member states, except Denmark and the United Kingdom, are legally bound to join the euro [ 158 ] when the convergence criteria are met, however only a few countries have set target dates for accession. Sweden has circumvented the requirement to join the euro by not meeting the membership criteria. [ r ]
<p> The euro is designed to help build a single market by, for example: easing travel of citizens and goods, eliminating exchange rate problems, providing price transparency, creating a single financial market , price stability and low interest rates , and providing a currency used internationally and protected against shocks by the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone. It is also intended as a political symbol of integration and stimulus for more. [ 159 ] Since its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro. [ 160 ] The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the European Central Bank (ECB). [ 161 ]
<p> The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability . It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks , which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the President of the ECB , who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 EU member states. [ 162 ]
<p> In 2006, the EU-27 had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). [ 167 ] Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported. [ 167 ] In these statistics, nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the EU, regardless of the source of the uranium, of which less than 3% is produced in the EU. [ 168 ]
<p> The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community . The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007. [ 169 ]
<p> The EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market , encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia [ 170 ] and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation ; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies. [ 169 ]
<p> The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda. [ 175 ] The Polish road network in particular was in poor condition: at Poland's accession to the EU, a number of roads needed to be upgraded, particularly the A4 autostrada , requiring approximately 13billion. [ 176 ] [ 177 ]
<p> The Galileo positioning system is another EU infrastructure project. Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system, to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), and is to be operational by 2012. [ needs update ] The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated Global Positioning System , but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for far greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system. [ 178 ] It has been criticised by some due to costs, delays, and their perception of redundancy given the existence of the GPS system. [ 179 ]
<h> Agriculture
<p> The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of the oldest policies of the European Community, and was one of its core aims. [ 180 ] The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers. [ t ] It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then European Community 's annual budget, and still accounts for around 34%. [ 181 ] [ dated info ]
<p> The policy's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction, resulting in so-called butter mountains and wine lakes . These were intervention stores of produce bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside of Europe, especially those in the developing world . [ 182 ]
<p> The overproduction has also been criticised for encouraging environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods. [ 182 ] Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. However, the EU's small farmers receive only 8% of CAP's available subsidies. [ 182 ]
<p> Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels, while maintaining agricultural income levels. [ 180 ] One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU. [ 146 ]
<h> Environment
<p> In 1957, when the EU was founded, it had no environmental policy, no environmental bureaucracy, and no environmental laws. [ 183 ] Today, the EU has some of the most progressive environmental policies of any state in the world. The environmental policy of the EU has therefore developed in remarkable fashion in the past four decades. An increasingly dense network of legislation has emerged, which now extends to all areas of environmental protection, including: air pollution control, water protection, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks. [ 184 ] The Institute for European Environmental Policy estimates the body of EU environmental law amounts to well over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions. [ 185 ] Environmental policy has thus become a core area of European politics.
<p> Such dynamic developments are surprising in light of the legal and institutional conditions which existed in the late 1950s and 60s. [ 186 ] Acting without any legislative authority, European policy-makers initially increased the EU's capacity to act by defining environmental policy as a trade problem. The most important reason for the introduction of a common environmental policy was the fear that trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards. [ 187 ] However, in the course of time, EU environmental policy emerged as a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, policy principles and procedures. The legal basis of EU environmental policy was not more explicitly established until the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987. [ 185 ]
<p> Initially, EU environmental policy was rather introspective. More recently, however, the Union has demonstrated a growing leadership in global environmental governance. The role of the EU in securing the ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in the face of US opposition is an example in this regard. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognises that its strategic objectives can only be achieved if a series of key international environmental agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at an EU level and worldwide. The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty further strengthens the EU's global environmental leadership ambitions. [ 188 ] The vast body of EU environmental law which now exists has played a vital role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe as well as contributed to improvements in air and water quality and waste management. [ 185 ] However, significant challenges remain, both to meet existing EU targets and aspirations and to agree new targets and actions that will further improve the environment and the quality of life in Europe and beyond.
<p> One of the top priorities of EU environmental policy is combatting climate change. In 2007, member states agreed that the EU is to use 20% renewable energy in the future and that it has to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels. [ 189 ] This includes measures that in 2020, 10% of the overall fuel quantity used by cars and trucks in EU 27 should be running on renewable energy such as biofuels . This is considered to be one of the most ambitious moves of an important industrialised region to fight climate change . [ 190 ]
<p> Education and science are areas where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In education, the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme , a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20years, it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life. [ 191 ]
<p> There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training , and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013 . These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU. [ 192 ] [ 193 ] Through its support of the Bologna Process , the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.
<p> Health care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.
<p> All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries. [ 199 ] A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients. [ 200 ] [ 201 ] [ 202 ]
<p> In 2010, 47.3 million people lived in the EU, who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million). [ 206 ]
<p> Language policy is the responsibility of member states, but EU institutions promote the learning of other languages. [ u ] [ 214 ] English is the most spoken language in the EU, being spoken by 51% of the EU population when counting both native and non-native speakers. [ 215 ] German is the most widely spoken mother tongue (about 88.7million people in 2006). 56% of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue. [ 216 ] Most official languages of the EU belong to the Indo-European language family , except Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, which belong to the Uralic language family, and Maltese, which is an Afroasiatic language . Most EU official languages are written in the Latin alphabet except Bulgarian, written in Cyrillic , and Greek, written in the Greek alphabet . [ 217 ]
<p> Besides the 24 official languages, there are about 150 regional and minority languages , spoken by up to 50million people. [ 217 ] Of these, only the Spanish regional languages (Catalan, Galician, and Basque), Scottish Gaelic, and Welsh [ 218 ] can be used by citizens in communication with the main European institutions. [ 219 ] Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages, the protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the individual member states. The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage.
<p> The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe". [ 221 ] Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or God or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped. [ 222 ]
<p> Eurostat 's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52% of EU citizens believed in a God, 27% in "some sort of spirit or life force", and 18% had no form of belief. [ 226 ] Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years. [ 227 ] The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16%) and the Czech Republic (19%). [ 226 ] The most religious countries are Malta (95%; predominantly Roman Catholic), and Cyprus and Romania both with about 90% of the citizens believing in God (both predominantly Orthodox). Across the EU, belief was higher among women, increased with age, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 with a basic education, and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale (57%)." [ 226 ]
<p> Sport is mainly the responsibility of an individual member states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have had an impact on sport, such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the Bosman ruling , which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship. [ 233 ] The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity. [ 234 ] This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA , due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs. [ 235 ] The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project. [ 236 ]
