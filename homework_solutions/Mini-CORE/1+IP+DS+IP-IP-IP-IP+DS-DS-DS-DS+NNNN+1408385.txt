<p> I am so completely happy and satisfied with my purchase of this phone. It was WELL worth the cost. I use my handset ALL the time! I loved it so much, I actually bought one for my best friend! It's so much easier to use than holding my iPhone all the time! Thank you for a WONDERFUL product! I LOVE IT!
<p> How did the image on site compare with the actual product? Perfectly!
<p> Was the product free of any manufacturer defects? Yes! It arrived in PERFECT condition!
<p> This handset might just be the greatest product ever... 1) Consistent use allows you to lower your exposure to harmful cell phone radiation. Boom. 2) If you're like most women, your purse is full of crap. By the time you've located your ringing phone at the bottom of your purse, you've missed the call. That's no longer the case with this handset- it's big, bright, beautiful and easy to pick up and answer. The pick up/hang up button (works with iphones and HTC phones, in my experience) is perfect, and the volume buttons are great (works only on iphones, I believe). 3) Remember the days when you could hold your land line phone between your shoulder and ear, thus freeing your two hands to do whatever kind of multitasking they need to do? You can have those days back with this amazing product. 4) Get ready for all the confused and amused looks you'll get when you pull it out of your purse to answer a call when you're out on the town. Hilarious. 5) Excellent sound quality. Better than using my phone alone, actually, because it doesn't get hot and make my ear sweaty (which leads to a crusty, wet phone after any 20+ minute conversation). 6) Overstock has the best price. I've seen this product sold on the street in NYC and at popular retailers for up to 5x the Overstock price. Plus Overstock sells it in a rainbow of colors.
<p> How did the image on site compare with the actual product? Just as expected
<p> Now I can talk on the "phone" again. Feels like a regular phone and the sound is better through this handset than through my iPhone's headset. Friends saw it and went on-line to order. Got my order in 3 days! Also...if you install free talkatone app on your ipod touch you can make FREE outgoing calls! Get 'em while you can still get 'em. I got black...it's so traditional looking.
<p> How did the image on site compare with the actual product? the actual product looked even better than the photo
<p> Was the product free of any manufacturer defects? yes
<p> Please tell us about the quality of the product. well made. A great price for this product....
<p> This handset is identical to the original ones except it is lighter and has a nice rubberized grip to it. It works perfectly, the sound quality is better than any I have seen yet. I bought a yellow one to use with my new iPhone 5 when driving in the car when receiving calls. You can easily answer calls with the switch on the handset which is cleverly concealed and you will get some looks from other motorists when they pass and see you talking on an old style telephone handset. You can even use it to listen to music on your phone, the sound is that good. A very fair price for a very cool item. I may purchase these as Christmas gifts for all the iPhone users in my family this year, in different colors.

<p> The container states that it &quot;eliminates 99% of absorbed phone radiation**&quot; - but doesn't address the double asterisk. Where can I verify this claim? overkcots on Jul 1, 2012 Please enter a valid question.
<p> The electronic parts used to build this retro phone includes a speaker and a microphone, both will not generate radiation, they only generate sound waves. The double asterisk is a typo, please excuse. overstockcustomercare1 on Jul 12, 2012
