<h> 'It means everything that people are trying to help'
<p> CASH is to be raised for a seven-year-old battling terminal cancer and a 12-year-old schoolgirl suffering from alopecia.
<p> A special joint charity walk will aim to raise enough money for both little Charlotte Bragg, pictured, and Georgia Howells.
<p> Georgia, 12, a Pen y Dre schoolgirl, is in desperate need of a suction wig, which is only made in New Zealand and costs 2,200.
<p> Meanwhile, the family of Charlotte, a seven-year-old fighting an aggressive form of soft tissue cancer who wished only to live long enough to see her mam and dad renew their wedding vows, are hoping enough money can be raised so she and her parents can enjoy their final weeks together.
<p> This Saturday, July 14, fundraisers will complete a 12-mile trek between Merthyr and Nelson.
<p> Donna James, Charlotte's 33-year-old cousin, is hopeful any money received will create valuable memories for the family.
<p> She said: "The doctors still can't believe she is still alive. They told us when she had her brain scan that she only had a matter of weeks to live.
<p> "The only thing she wanted was to be a princess for the day when her parents, Cecilia and Mark, renewed their vows. That happened in May and she is still going OK.
<p> "But her doctors said they don't think she will last the summer. There's nothing we can do for her but it means everything to us that people are trying to help.
<p> "The more money we can make, the more memories we can create for her parents in the next few weeks."
<p> The event has been organised by Martin Brogden and ex-serviceman Paul Thomas, who carried the Olympic torch through Merthyr Tydfil in May.
<p> He will be carrying it again on Saturday.
<p> Martin, 42, said: "We originally set out to do it for Georgia but we got a call from Charlotte's family to ask if we could help them as well.
<p> "We try to help whoever we can every year. We never do it for the same charity and will continue to do so for years to come."
<p> Lynette Howells, Georgia's mother, said that her daughter will have a renewed confidence with a custom-made wig that she can wear every day.
<p> Georgia had received a treatment called diphencyprone, which is proven to regrow hair for only 23% of people with alopecia.
<p> "It didn't work," said Lynette, 43, "so the only other option we have is to buy a special suction wig for Georgia to wear.
<p> "It will give her a bit more freedom and a lot more confidence. With a normal wig, she is still unable to do the things she really enjoys, such as swimming and gymnastics.
<p> "It's absolutely fantastic what this community is doing for her. I only wish there were more people like them."
<p> A special thank you has also been made to staff at AJ Prints, who have sponsored the walk, and Miller Argent, the land reclamation group, which has funded a mini bus service for the day.
