<p> Looking back upon my youth-- The time I always knew the truth. I don't want to do it. I don't want to say goodbye.
<p> To go back in the yard and play-- If I could only have another day. I don't want to do it. I don't want to make you cry.
<p> To go back On the hill beside the track And try to concentrate. All in all the places that I want to be, No, it shows you that I could not wait.
<p> So come back into my arms again. This love of ours, it has no end. I don't want to do it. I don't want to make you cry. { From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/g/george-har\\... }
<p> I don't want to do it. I don't want to say goodbye.
<p> I don't want to do it. I don't want to see you cry.
<p> To go back On the hill beside the track And try to concentrate. All in all the places that I want to be, No, it shows you that I could not wait.
<p> So come back into my arms again. This love of ours, it has no end. I don't want to do it. I don't want to say goodbye.
