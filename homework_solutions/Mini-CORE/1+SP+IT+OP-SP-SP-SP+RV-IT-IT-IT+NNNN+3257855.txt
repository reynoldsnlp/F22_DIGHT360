<h> Listen to METZ's Dbut Album
<p> The Toronto trio METZ is rude, severe, and excellent. They make rock music, all of it loud, most of it precise without feeling checked. It's raucous stuff, heavily indebted to music recorded for the Chicago label Tough & Go in the eighties, and recordings made in the nineties for the D.C. label Dischord. We are happy to be streaming their self-titled dbut album, exclusively, until Wednesday. A few days ago, I spoke on the phone with the band's guitarist and singer, Alex Edkins.
<p> Can you give me a brief history of the band?
<p> [The drummer] Hayden [Menzies] and I started playing music together in Ottawa when we were pretty young. We started METZ there with one other guy, about five years ago. We decided a change of scenery would be a good idea, so we moved down to Toronto four years ago. The other guy decided to stay in Ottawa.
<p> The moment you started playing together was five years ago?
<p> Yeah. But that's before we met [the bassist] Chris [Slorach]. We found Chris in Toronto, and that's when the real band came together and we started to put out records.
<p> Ottawa is a great town for live music.
<p> It is. I feel really fortunate to have started there, because, at the time, it was just an amazing place for punk rock and hardcore, a real tight-knit community. There's nothing better than being in the community center, or wherever it was, and seeing these bands that are not getting paid much, if anything. It was a small group of people, but man, was it ever the best thing. Those guys and girls just went crazy. It's what we know, and we can't really conceive of doing it any other way when we get up there to play.
<p> Do Toronto and Ottawa have specific musical tendencies?
<p> Well, yeah. Ottawa is the capital city; it's the government city. You either work for the government or you serve the people who work for the government. And there's not much night life, everyone's in bed early, so we just kind of had to make our own thing. That's when the punk scene in Ottawa came out of. And it's not as political as D.C., the conditions aren't anything like the same, but I do think the fact that it was kind of like a sleepy government city made the perfect condition for an actual real community to come about and to spawn some really cool stuff.
<p> I think our record, lyrically, is a complete product of living in Toronto. Most of it is dealing with the modern way of life in a gigantic city and feeling some of those conditions starting to weigh down on you: the anxiety, the hysteria, the speed at which you. That's where the lyrics are coming from.
<p> How do you guys work when you put songs together?
<p> It's a hundred per cent collective. We very rarely will come to the rehearsal space with even a segment of a song. We usually come in with nothing and the three of us will make something from scratch, all in the same room, all at the same time . We always try to make the bass and the guitar sound like one thing, not to sound like there's a couple of different parts, but make the whole entire song to sound like there's just one wave of sound. We find being in the same room and doing it together makes for something different than if I was to stay at home and put it down in the computer and then try to layer the bass track underneath or something like that; you don't have the same immediacy and the same feeling, so we just do it that way. And it's part of the reason the record took so damn long, because it's not fast. It's a lot of banging your head against the wall, it's a lot of walking out of the space with nothing accomplished.
<p> We all got really excited about trying to write songs that had moments of standard song arrangements . We love pop music, we love all styles of music. We wanted it to be well-arranged songs, but with the moments of craziness to be totally under control and totally blatant, and then being able to rein it back at the same time. It's a hundred per cent collective the way we write, and then I write the lyrics after.
<p> Are there words that you guys use a lot when you're talking about the work you do together?
<p> Yes, but I'm not comfortable saying them. You know all about it; there's that band talk that's complete gibberish. We use that.
<p> Are there other bands working now that you guys admire?
<p> I think the new Soupcans record is incredible. I've heard some of it. I think they're coming through New York soon; they left for tour today. I think Toronto has got some serious stuff happening.
