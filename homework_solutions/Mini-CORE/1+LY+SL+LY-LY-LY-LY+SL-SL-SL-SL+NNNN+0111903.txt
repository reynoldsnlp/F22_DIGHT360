<p> But I'd like to get to know you (Yes I would) But I'd like to get to know you (If I could) But I'd like to get to know you
<p> Finally I've found Searching all around Just was not the answer One I thought was true Looked a bit like you I figured I'd might chance her
<p> But I'd like to get to know you (Yes I would) But I'd like to get to know you (If I could) But I'd like to get to know you
<p> Hardly need to say She went on her way Said it was all over Well it's been some time And I guess that I'm just meant to be a Rover
<p> But I'd like to get to know you (Yes I would) Yes I'd like to get to know you (If I could)
<p> Well I can't promise that I'll spend a day with you I can't promise that I'll find a way with you I can't promise No, I can't promise that I'll love you
<p> But I'd like to get to know you (Yes I would) Yes I'd like to get to know you (If I could) I'd like to get to know you, know you, know I'd like to get to know you, know you, know I'd like to get to know you, know you, know Yes I'd like to get to know you, know you, know
