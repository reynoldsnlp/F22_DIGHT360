<h> Woman You Have Been A Friend To Me lyrics
<h> Bobby Bare Woman You Have Been A Friend To Me lyrics
<p> I appreciate the coffee that you made I appreciate the shelter of your roof I'll pay you back someday for all the kindness and all the other liberties I took Although I cannot say that I have loved you I won't forget how good it was to be Among the people you call little darling hey woman you have been a friend to me Woman you have been a friend to me and somewhere down the line I'll drink a toast To the lady who encouraged me to try and took me in when I was down and broke I hope that life holds many thrills for you and there are great big apples on your tree I'm sorry that I could't give you more than thanks But woman you have been a friend to me woman you have been a friend to me [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bobby\\... ]
