<h> On Top Of The World Lyrics
<p> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, I never knew, it could feel, Just like a dream but so real, I took a chance and found all the strength I needed, I look around above you, I live without raditude, ' go for the wind and I will 'cause I believe that...
<p> Everyone could be a star, Don't you know within you are, And it feels so good standin' up here
<p> On top of the world, I never wanna come down, I could stay forever yeah,
<p> On top of the world, 'cause it's everything I want now, There is nothing better
<p> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh So when you dream, deep inside, When ya never know 'till when you try, So when you see It's your chance ya gotta take it, I Look around every face,
<p> Hear the croud scream my name, i'm gonna win, Because I know i'm gonna make it everyone could be a star, Don't you know within you are, And it feels so good standing up here
<p> On top of the world, I never wanna come down, I could stay forever yeah,
<p> On top of the world, 'cause it's everthing I want now, There is nothing better
<p> On top of the world, Since where will be the end, Because you know I like it here,
<p> On top of the world, do you like it,it's the air, Always need ya right by me Every stars a big shine, And everybody's got there own life,
