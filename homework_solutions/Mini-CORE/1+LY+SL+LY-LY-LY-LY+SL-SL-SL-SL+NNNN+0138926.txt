<h> First Bite Lyrics
<h> More Than a Thousand
<p> The world of the the dead Sings at your door That's why you can't sleep at night You've haunting this city for too long Hiding underneath the london fog
<p> You were bitten first on the darkest of nights. Now you'll be living this life forever And no one is ready for this, and no one is ready for this, But i'm not afraid to die
<p> ::::Refrao::::
<p> It's in your eyes, under your skin and i don't understand up in the sky, on the blackest night come down and take my hand.
<p> Every minute you live someone dies I swear that I have tried Only to find that I am lost again ::::::::::::::
<p> Another night, The streets are filled whit filth and shit They smell like blood and cheap wine You live in the depths of forever but i will find you You live in the depths of forever but i will hunt you down
<p> You were bitten first on the darkest of nights. Now you'll be living this life forever And no one is ready for this, and no one is ready for this, But i'm not afraid to die
<p> It's in your eyes, under your skin and i don't understand up in the sky, on the blackest night come down and take my hand.
<p> Every minute you live someone dies I swear that I have tried Only to find that I am lost again
<p> Like an anchor, All i do is drag you down with me (x2)
<p> DRAG YOU DOWN WITH ME!
<p> It's in your eyes, under your skin and i don't understand up in the sky, on the blackest night come down and take my hand.
<p> Every minute you live someone dies I swear that I have tried Only to find that I am lost again
