<h> Police helmet cams go up in smoke
<h> The latest crime-fighting gadget, a cigar-sized camera attached to a police helmet, has gone up in smoke after problems with its batteries setting on fire.

<p> The 1,700 devices, which are strapped on to helmets or under caps, record video and sound as evidence to present in court and were introduced nationwide in a 3 million Home Office scheme two years ago.
<p> However, frontline officers now want reassurances that they are not in danger of a hair raising experience because of faulty wiring in the devices' chargers.
<p> The battery packs to at least two of the cameras being used by Metropolitan Police officers started smoking while being charged.
<p> The chargers concerned had been withdrawn, and Scotland Yard is now in discussion with the manufacturer about replacements.
<p> Peter Smyth, chairman of the Met Police Federation, representing more than 30,000 rank-and-file officers, said: "We are totally in favour of new technology that improves our evidence gathering capabilities as long as it is safe and easy to use. There is a concern if the equipment puts officers in danger."
<p> Half of the borough police units of Greater London have purchased between one and ten mini cameras.
<p> They are used by patrolling police officers to film rowdy late-night scenes, underage drinkers, controversial stop and search confrontations and domestic violence incidents.
<p> The cameras can store up to 400 hours of footage with soundtrack on their hard drive, with a battery life of eight to 12 hours.
<p> A spokesman for the Met said: "There have been a very small number of incidents involving battery chargers that have emitted smoke - as explained above, these chargers are office-based and not carried on the officer's person."
<p> A spokesman for the Home Office said: "The Home Office provided the extra funding for forces to be able to purchase cameras.
<p> "Their maintenance and use is an issue for individual forces and the National Police Improvement Agency."
