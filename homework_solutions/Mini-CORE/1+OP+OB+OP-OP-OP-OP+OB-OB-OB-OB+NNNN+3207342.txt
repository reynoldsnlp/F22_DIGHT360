<h> Four More Years of the Same???
<p> 07 11 12
<p> Now that Alyona Minkovski has gone over to the dark side, meaning Arianna Huffington (formerly Stassinopoulos) and her YouTube minions, RT's latest attempt to reach a younger (and more critical) audience is the show Breaking the Set , presented by Abby Martin, and it 'is a show that cuts through the false Left/Right paradigm and pre-established narrative set in the corporate news and political establishment. Host Abby Martin undermines the mainstream media propaganda while calling out the real players behind the scenes'. And now the election season is finally over, here is Abby Martin explaining that your vote is much more than casting a choice on a ballot. In fact, you can vote in more ways than you know multiple times every day. So make it count (6 November 2012).
<p> On the other side of the aisle is Michael Moore exhorting U.S. citizens who have continued their support for the duopoly: "Congratulations everyone!! This country has truly changed, and I believe there will be no going back. Hate lost today. That is amazing in and of itself. And all the women who were elected tonight! A total rebuke of neanderthal attitudes.
<p> Now the real work begins. Millions of us must come together to insist that President Obama and the Democrats stand up and fight and, if the House doesn't want to play ball, do a massive end run around them. Likewise, we have to have Obama's back. As he is blocked and attacked by the Right, we need to be there with him. We are the majority. Let's act like it.
<p> And please Mr. President, make the banks and Wall Street pay. You're the boss, not them. Lead the fight to get money out of politics -- the spending on this election is shameful and dangerous. Don't wait til 2014 to bring the troops home -- bring 'em home now. Stop the drone strikes on civilians. End the senseless war on drugs. Act like a mother***** when it comes to climate change -- ignore the nuts and fix this now. Take the profit motive out of things that any civilized country would say, "this is for the common good." Make higher educational affordable for everyone and don't send 22-year olds out into the world already in debt. Order a moratorium on home foreclosures and evictions. There are ways to create good-paying jobs -- I have some ideas, if you've got a minute. Make your second term historical!
<p> Finally thanks to the Occupy movement who, a year ago, set the tone of this election heart with "the 1% vs. everybody else" -- and inspired Obama and his campaign to realize that there was huge popular sentiment against what the wealthy have done. And that led to Romney's "47%" remarks which was the beginning of the end of his campaign. Thank you Mother Jones for releasing that secret tape and thank you to the minimum wage worker who did the secret taping. Thank you Sandra Fluke for enduing the insults hurled at you and becoming an important grass-roots leader. Thank you Todd Aikin for... well, for just being you. Thank you CEOs of Chrysler and GM for coming out forcefully against a Republican candidate, saying he lived in "an alternate universe" when he lied about Jeep. Thank you for Governor Cristie for being the final nail in the coffin.
<p> And thank you Mother Nature, in all your horrific damage you caused last week, you became, ironically, the undoing of a Party that didn't believe in you or your climate changing powers.

<p> Can't believe I missed that, that for referring that Breaking The Set clip. As much as I was starting to like the show, I wasn't so clear on how much I liked Abby herself until now. I thought maybe it was just how good she looks for such a semi-model, as usual, it turns out that it is her. She gets so pissed off, and I'm so much mellower with age, it sometimes feels like she has little regard for all the idiots. Anyways, this clarification of her views as so similar to mine gives me much respect. The revolution is between your own ears.
<p> Good -- I should definitely pronounce, impressed with your site. I had no trouble navigating through all tabs as well as related information ended up being truly easy to do to access. I recently found what I hoped for before you know it at all. Quite unusual. Is likely to appreciate it for those who add forums or anything, web site theme . a tones way for your customer to communicate. Nice task..
