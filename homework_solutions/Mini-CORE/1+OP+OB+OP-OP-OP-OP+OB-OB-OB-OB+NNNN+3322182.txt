<h> The ultimate solution for Forex Traders
<h> It's not a matter of 'If'... it's a matter of 'when'
<p> The 500 Euro Dollar order that I told you about on Wednesday that was sitting on the Euro at 1.3010 has been triggered and price did move higher by 25 pips to this point. Big money flow orders such as those can be priceless and being a GoldRock member enables you to position your money on many occasions right alongside institutional money. Just don't tell anyone!
<p> What did I tell you this morning in the GoldRock Insider at 9am? Do you remember when I said it was not in the media yet but it would be shortly and the BOJ would soon look to intervene on the JPY and drive the USD higher? This is the headline on CNBC this afternoon http://www.cnbc.com/id/49027963
<p> The European markets were closed when Helicopter Ben announced this new grand plan so I expect the rally to continue tonight. There is no news to stop it or nothing big enough to derail the rally this week unless something pops up on the radar that we haven't seen yet. Euro Zone finance ministers meet Friday to discuss Greece and Spain's ongoing debt issues but I doubt the bulls will stop running until early next week. The head of steam is at fever pitch and we'll let the amateurs pile in Monday long when we take some profit and await a pause and pull back.
<p> I was phoned today at 7am this morning by a number of media outlets asking for my opinion. Once again I gave it to them straight up with no BS. Here is the article that was in the Herald Sun post the interview and other AAP online publication syndicated networks
<p> So many of you are cleaning up on these Order Sheet numbers and thank you for your emails. Our office smiles broadly when we receive such emails and our focus and continued commitment to deliver you big money flow orders, professional strategies and risk management principles is only going to get better and better.
<p> Some say the glass is half full, some say the glass is half empty. I say "Are you gonna drink that?"
