<h> Book Description
<p> Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky's insights into the Tarot as a spiritual path
<p>  Works with the original Marseille Tarot to reveal the roots of Western wisdom
<p>  Provides the key to the symbolic language of the Tarot's "nomadic cathedral"
<p>  Transforms a simple divination tool into a vehicle for self-realization and healing
<p> Alejandro Jodorowsky's profound study of the Tarot, which began in the early 1950s, reveals it to be far more than a simple divination device. The Tarot is first and foremost a powerful instrument of self-knowledge and a representation of the structure of the soul.
<p> The Way of Tarot shows that the entire deck is structured like a temple, or a mandala, which is both an image of the world and a representation of the divine. The authors use the sacred art of the original Marseille Tarot--created during a time of religious tolerance in the 11th century--to reconnect with the roots of the Tarot's Western esoteric wisdom. They explain that the Tarot is a "nomadic cathedral" whose parts--the 78 cards or "arcana"--should always be viewed with an awareness of the whole structure. This understanding is essential to fully grasp the Tarot's hermetic symbolism.
<p> The authors explore the secret associations behind the hierarchy of the cards and the correspondences between the suits and energies within human beings. Each description of the Major Arcana includes key word summaries, symbolic meanings, traditional interpretations, and a section where the card speaks for itself. Jodorowsky and Costa then take the art of reading the Tarot to a depth never before possible. Using their work with Tarology, a new psychological approach that uses the symbolism and optical language of the Tarot to create a mirror image of the personality, they offer a powerful tool for self-realization, creativity, and healing.

<h> Editorial Reviews
<h> Review
<p> "A profound work that is both penetrating and fascinating. It offers thought-provoking commentary on the cards from a pair of authors who are among the world's most deeply knowledgeable authorities on the tarot." ( Kooch Daniels , co-author of Matrix Meditations , Oct 2009 )
<p> " The Way of Tarot is a very impressive work. Whether you agree with the authors conclusions or not, it will make you think outside of the box, and will perhaps be the impetus needed for someone out there in the Tarot world to connect the dots between their thoughts and present them for examination. . . . This is a worthwhile addition to the Tarot library of anyone that wishes to move beyond the divination aspects of the cards into self-realization." ( Bonnie Cehovet , certified Tarot Grand Master, Aeclectic Tarot , Oct 2009 )
<p> "An excellent all-around guide to both the nuts-and-bolts practical and the spiritual sides of Tarot, The Way of Tarot is filled with invaluable insights for Tarot practitioners of all skill and experience levels." ( The Midwest Book Review, Library Bookwatch , Feb 2010 )
<p> "The beginning of this book reads like a sophisticated treasure-hunt adventure. It also happens to include a history of tarot cards, which will be invaluable to people who are studying tarot seriously. . . . a reference they can go back to over and over again as they gain experience with the cards." ( Anna Jedrziewski , New Age Retailer magazine, Feb 2010 )
<p> "The purpose of this book is to show the reader how the tarot can be seen and used in a practical way that is holistic, balanced,and grounded. . . . The Way of Tarot can be a guide along this path." ( New Spirit Journal , Vol. 5, No. 12, April 2010 )
<p> "The beauty of this deck is that Jodorwsky puts aside the Kabalistic and other Western influences upon the tarot and just studies the primal and bare gestures, numbers, and minute details . . . " ( Indras Net , blog: The Sync Whole;@The Heart of Jupiter-Evolve!, Mar 10 )

<p> ALEJANDRO JODOROWSKY is a filmmaker who made the legendary El Topo and The Holy Mountain . He also is a psychotherapist and author of many books on Tarot and spiritualism, including Psychomagic and The Spiritual Journey of Alejandro Jodorowsky . MARIANNE COSTA has worked with Jodorowsky since 1997, coteaching workshops on Tarot and family-tree therapy. She is the author of No Woman's Land . Both authors live in Paris.
<p> I am not a fan of the Tarot de Marseille, but the text and the logic of this book is fascinating and illuminating. I don't know if the casual Tarot reader would ever appreciate this book, but any Jungian or creative artist working with the collective unconscious would LOVE it. Highly recommended.
<p> This is probably the most fascinating book on the Tarot of Marsielle that I have ever read. I'm learning more than I ever knew due to the authors deconstructing the symbology via numerology, colors used, earth squares, heaven squares, etc. I've just finished the first 100 pages and have ordered the Tarot of Marsielle deck through the Camoin website. Extremely fascinating! A+.
<p> There are good reviews of this book already, but they all focus on the positives and there are some definite negatives for me. I imagine other new readers may also feel this way as time goes on.
<p> First off, I found Jodorowsky to be rather limited in his ideas of sexuality and he sees the Tarot as 100% heterosexually enforced. He can't help but bring up sex on every page, and yet, offers little beyond what seems to be a very rigid approach to sex, gender, and gender roles in society. For example, he states that a major relationship problem occurs when the "woman of a couple is more masculine and the man more feminine. This will induce a cosmic disorder..." and provides countless examples of how women are 'receptive' and men are 'active'. Basically he comes off as an old man who is set in his conservative ways - maybe not quite a misogynist but definitely there's something there.
<p> He states his reasoning for not using Tarot as an oracle or fortune-telling device is a passage from the Bible that goes on about not being a soothsayer, not practicing divination, etc. That's fine to not believe the Tarot is used for divination, but to quote the Bible as proof? There are countless numbers of quotes that people today would find to be very bad advice, and that particular quote rings of intolerance of the times rather than divine direction. The author tries to justify his religious beliefs quite often, which is unnecessary and frankly not appealing when trying to learn about the Tarot.
<p> However, besides these major shortcomings (the authors dogmatic beliefs get in the way of his full understanding with the Tarot) there is a lot to like about this book. It goes into vivid detail on the combination of cards, and really provides some great food for thought for folks interested in the psychological aspects of the Tarot as I am. Using it as a tool in therapy is fantastic and Jodorowsky offers come interesting and useful advice here as well.
<h> Forums
<p> On the uk amazon site, search for 'Jodorowski' in 'All departments'. You will then see Tarot Kit (1 jeu), or maybe it was called 'kit' only.. Anyway, it is a kit of Jodorowski's book and a deck of his restored cards. The price is a little over 15 British pounds.
