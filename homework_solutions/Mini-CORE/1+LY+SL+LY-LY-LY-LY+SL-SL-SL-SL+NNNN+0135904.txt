<p> Good evening my friends, where do I begin? This is a story about the girl, from across the sea. Big brown eyes, and a clever disguise; And a stupid grin and a song to sing. Having my chance, when he asked her to dance, And, I think this girl has fallen into me The night, as of when?, never saw her again I guess some things in life, just ain't supposed to be
<p> Chorus Its over, she's over me, I got your postcard, but can't forget the way you taste. Its over, she's over me, I'm going home now, and I can't help but feel I'm out of place.
<p> I'd cross the ocean if I, could spend the rest of my life on a deserted island when I get there maybe you'll take me for a ride? Rocking my brains, I'm going insane I'm trying to find the words to take away the pain But when I think of her lips; and her smile and her tits I wonder how I had the strength to walk away She gave it all, and she wanted to loll (?) When she held my hand, and then she smiled at me. Made me believe, I could do anything I guess some things in life, just ain't supposed to be
<p> Chorus
<p> I can hear her callin' in the air tonight, and it's been a while, oh, I can ??ear her callin' in the air tonight, and it's been a while since I'd a held you tight.
<p> Good evening my friends, where do I begin? This is the story about the girl across the sea Good evening my friends, where do I begin? I guess some things in life just ain't supposed to be!
<p> When I get back; we'll float on your back Now a Kodak moment - make a memory. Sleeping till noon; now I'm promising you, I'm going to show you how it was supposed to be, yeah!
