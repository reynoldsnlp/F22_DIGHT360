<h> Heart Failed (In The Back Of A Taxi) lyrics
<h> Saint Etienne Heart Failed (In The Back Of A Taxi) lyrics
<p> Took a trip down Anita Way Had to go on the 1st of May Didn't have much to celebrate Heart failed in the back of a taxi Heart failed in the back of a taxi doot do do doot do do Get yer kicks all around the world Give a tip to a geisha girl Fit your bit with a piece of pearl Heart failed in the back of a taxi Heart failed in the back of a taxi doot do do doot do do Sold the ground to a PLC Moved the club out to Newbury Sod the fans and their families Heart failed in the back of a taxi Heart failed in the back of a taxi Picture-house built in '23 It's a place out of history Pulled it down for your cash money Heart failed in the back of a taxi Heart failed in the back of a taxi doot do do doot do do [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/saint\\... ]
