<p> Where else can one find folks so racist that they don't even know they are. At least in other places such as China and the US the folks have evolved enough to recognize they are racist. Here words, like chink, dink, jap and ****** are still just part of almost day to day life. Especially outside of Sydney and Melbourne. And even Melbourne is suspect at times.
<p> Related to this Australia society is very hierarchical and very closed. I.e. one's path in life is pretty much determined by the level in which one was born. Much like 1975 UK.
<p> And what the heck is with the fear of becoming an independent nation and the queen worship. Geez. Nauseating.
<h> Your Response
<p> Yeah they love them selfs but don't like migrants! Sorry titoxx but may will find out later about surviving in Australia. You may do survive if you like drinking or watching a lot of TV. Don't waste your time in OZ dude ;)
