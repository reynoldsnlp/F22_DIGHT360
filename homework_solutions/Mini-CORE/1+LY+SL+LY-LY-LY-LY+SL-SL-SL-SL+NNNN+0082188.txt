<p> You make it hard to breathe It's as if I'm suffocating And when you're next to me I can feel your heartbeat through my skin It makes me sad to think This all could be for nothing I wish there was a way For you to see inside of me I've never felt this way About anyone or anything Tell me What do I have to do to make you happy? What do I have to do to make you understand? What do I have to do to make you want me? And, if I can't make you want me What do I have to do?
<p> I know exactly what you're thinking But I swear this time I will not let you down I'm not as selfish as I used to be That was a part of me that never made me proud Right now I think I would try anything Anything at all to keep you satisfied God I hope you see what loving you would do to me All I want is one more chance, so tell me... What do I have to do to make you love me?
<p> General Comment: beginning of this song ---&gt;he is saying how much he cares for her and that its sad to think that my love for her might just be for nothing and that he is trying to tell her that it has never been like this before and the
<p> cores ---&gt;he is saying what do i have to do to keep you around because he loves her so much that he would just do anything just to keep her with him
<p> Second part of the song ---&gt;he is saying that look i know before that i was selfish and a jerk to you but i am telling you this time i have changed for you and i sitting her saying that i will do anything for you to just see how much i have changed and that i really hope you see how much i really dont want to loose and if i do then it will not be good {i have heard it so many times}
<p> at the end of the song ---&gt;he is saying what do i have to do to forget you because she is driving him crazy with not just seeing how much she really meant to him
<p> i read the song and think thats sounds just like my relationship now...went out with a girl...would have given my life for her...then she realizes that she doesnt love me anymore...and now were working things out, but i feel exactly like the guy in the song..."what do i have to do"
<p> General Comment: I totlaay love this song. It can go both ways. It s phycotic in a way because its about this poor guy who is pining ove this one gir. He wants the is girl to tell him what to do to keep her. Like he can't live his his lif wiht out her. I can do the sam wahy form a gir's POV as well. One thing though there has bee a mistake in the last lin of the lyrics.
<p> General Comment: to me this song is about someone loving someone so intensely that they can actually feel their very being-and the other person really doesnt know how they feel --so what do they have to do (needing to express love but afraid of chasing someone away) and then what if the other person never comes around or what if they do and their feelings arent mutual and it was all for nothing
<p> for me this song speaks of a very special relationship --exactly like this song and it was all for nothing this song is so awesome you can feel the very passion that it's sang with
