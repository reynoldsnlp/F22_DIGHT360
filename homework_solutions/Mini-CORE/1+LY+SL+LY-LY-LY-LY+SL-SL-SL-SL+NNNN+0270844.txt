<p> you're easy to read always want what you ain't got you must have heard i met someone
<p> and just because you got to break my heart you think you can walk back in and make me come undone
<p> but you don't get to get to me don't get to be the reason i lose sleep don't get to hear i'm lost without you truth is i ain't thought about you all you are is a big black cloud in my past, and baby i'm all rained out i've let you go, i've set you free and you don't get to get to me
<p> so go drive right by my house with the windows down crank our song up on the stereo call as much as you want anytime that you want i'll just delete every message off my phone
<p> cause you don't get to get to me don't get to be the reason i lose sleep don't get to hear i'm lost without you truth is i ain't thought about you all you are is a big black cloud in my past, and baby i'm all rained out i've let you go, i've set you free and you don't get to get to me
<p> you don't get to get to me don't get to be the reason i lose sleep don't get to hear i'm lost without you truth is i ain't thought about you all you are is a big black cloud in my past, and baby i'm all rained out i've let you go, i've set you free and you don't get to get to me you don't get to get to me
