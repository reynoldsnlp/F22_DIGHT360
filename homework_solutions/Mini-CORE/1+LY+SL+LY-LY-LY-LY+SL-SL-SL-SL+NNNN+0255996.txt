<p> I let it all hang out last night Come in hung over this morning My woman met me at the door Preaching me this warning She said "You're gonna have to change Your sinful way of living" She's playing Hell Trying to get me to Heaven
<p> Well I promised to go to church with her About a month of Sundays ago And here it is, it's Sunday again And I ain't been once in a row And everytime that old church bell rings You can hear my rod and reel singing She's playing Hell Trying to get me to Heaven
<p> She's playing Hell Trying to get me to Heaven 'Cause there ain't no way All my sins could be forgiven There's only Ten Commandments But I broke at least eleven She's playing Hell Trying to get me to Heaven
<p> She went out and bought me A Sunday go-meeting suit And I must confess it looked pretty sharp With my old hunting boots But wore holes in both the knees Trying to roll them sevens She's playing Hell Trying to get me to Heaven
