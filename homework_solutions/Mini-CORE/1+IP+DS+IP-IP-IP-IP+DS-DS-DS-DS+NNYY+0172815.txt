<h> Product Description
<h> From the Back Cover
<p> Deep within you lies the same faith and longing that sent Peter walking across the wind-swept Sea of Galilee toward Jesus.
<p> In what ways is the Lord telling you, as he did Peter, "Come"?
<p> John Ortberg invites you to consider the incredible potential that awaits you outside your comfort zone. Out on the risky waters of faith, Jesus is waiting to meet you in ways that will change you forever, deepening your character and your trust in God. The experience is terrifying. It?s thrilling beyond belief. It?s everything you?d expect of someone worthy to be called Lord.
<p> The choice is yours to know him as only a water-walker can, aligning yourself with God?s purpose for your life in the process. There?s just one requirement: If You Want to Walk on Water, You?ve Got to Get Out of the Boat. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
<p> I can only agree with other reviewers. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It takes you phrase by phrase through the story of Peter walking on water (from the Gospels) and applies it to our lives today. It has also given me a fresh approach to reading and interpreting events related in the New Testament
<p> This book is brilliant. An easy read, broken into digestible chapters, this book will give Christians lacking confidence to live more actively for God (the majority of us in truth!), the boost they need. You will breathe sigh's of relief as you realise that you don't need to be a supersonic Christian, but simply walk as you are, trusting God will do the rest if you focus on Him. Ortberg is fantastic at making you feel refreshed and encouraged, challenging where you need it, but affirming you too. This is beautifully crafted and will leave you with a burden off your shoulders and a desire to Get out the Boat and walk :)
<p> This practical book can challenge our smugness as christians. With John Ortberg's stories that tie in with some down to earth and heavenly guidance, this is a must for the activist. The realism of being a boat potato coupled with the fact the once out of the boat we can fail, is most helpful. This book has been for me the kick I needed. I'm reading it for the second time, taking note of the questions that in mid life need to be asked.
