<p> I get in the car another tragic disaster. But I'm safe where I am, yet another is captured. The traffic is stopped. The people just stare. Another alert, does the kid have a prayer? Life is not fair!
<p> Its hard to look outside my door. With all the news reports and more. Yet I would do my part and stay on the line for all the kids out there who are getting hurt. It could have happened to me. Can you make me believe? This could have a happy end. 'Cause I am one of them.
<p> I try to grow up but I am chased by my fears. It could happen to me, and I worry in tears. Left to do and why was I spared? Life is not fair!
<p> Its hard to look outside my door. With all the news reports and more. Yet I would do my part and stay on the line for all the kids out there who are getting hurt. It could have happened to me. Can you make me believe? This could have a happy end. 'Cause I am one of them.
<p> I am one of them, am one of them. I am one of them, am one of them. I am one of them, am one of them. I wish I could bring back all of them.
