<p> I'm the first to admit that yes, I've given some pretty shitty customer service in the past.  I even told someone to fuck off once when I was a teenager, and it was sort of justified, but it was before I had learned that fake I don't really give a shit what you say to me I'm just going to keep smiling expression that so many people in the service industry manage to develop.
<p> I don't really give a shit what you say to me I'm just going to keep smiling
<p> Even recently I'm pretty sure I've given some crappy service, more out of mental exhaustion than anything else.  When you get tired, sometimes that faade of perpetual happiness slips and you end up just selling the poor bastard on the other side of the counter their book, and then send them on their way.  I guess my version of crappy service is more indifference than anything else, which is why it annoys me so much when I get given shitty service when I'm the customer.
<p> I don't give a crap if you've had a bad day, or your dog died, or your boyfriend threw all your clothes out a fifth floor window when the street sweeper was driving past. Would it hurt you to smile?  At least pretend you care a little bit?  If I'm an asshole to you then fine, I give you permission for your smile to slip, but if I've only just walked in the store or to the counter, at least try to exude some kind of confidence or job satisfaction.
<p> You know what happens if you give me service that makes me want to smash my purchases into your face?  I tell everyone about it.  And I don't come back.  And then I tell some more people about it.  This pretty much continues for years. I'm probably telling people about your shitty service long after you've finally found a job that vaguely uses your degree in anthropology or philosophy or whatever fucking useless subject all the kids are doing nowadays.
<p> Seriously.  If you don't have the ability to at least attempt to give some kind of decent service, there is only one explanation.  You're a massive douchebag.  Colossal.  Douche of blimp proportions.  And chances are you're probably like this around everyone else too.
<p> This is all well and good, if you've made peace with your douche canoe status like I have.  If you haven't however, then here is a guide to the signs that your customer wants to pour their trim soy half strength decaf latte with no foam over your enormous head.
<h> 1.  They say 'thank you' in a rather agressive manner
<p> This is pretty much numero uno in the 'fuck you asshole I'm going to your competitor's store down the road' expressions list.  You lost that customer, they ain't coming back, and chances are they'll tell everyone they know that you're a dick.  more than likely you were either abrupt or short with them, or lacked any kind of interest in them at all.  Talking to other staff, not saying hello, snatching products from hands, lack of a smile, all these things will contribute to a pissed off customer.
<h> 2.  They start shouting at you
<p> This a pretty obvious sign of dissatisfaction, and sometimes is just purely because the customer is a bigger asshole than you are, but it's often because you haven't offered them a solution to their problem.  If you can't offer them a solution to the problem, find someone who can, or at least give them a valid explanation as to why you can't fix it.  If they're still shouting then chances are they aren't worth trying to keep as a customer.  This is where 'fuck off' would be a useful expression, but unfortunately the best reaction is probably more along the lines of 'I'm sorry, I'm unable to solve your problem today, if you continue shouting at me then I'm afraid I'm going to have to call security'.
<h> 3.  They avoid you like the plague when they walk in the door
<p> Yes, they could be shoplifters.  Maybe.  But chances are they're probably avoiding you because you have that 'I'm gonna pounce on them and sell them ALL THE THINGS' expression on your face.  Leave them alone, if they want your help, they'll ask for it.  And yes, I know your head office has probably said you have to approach every customer, but this does not mean push products on them and ask probing questions straight away.  Read their body language, just say hello.  You'll be able to tell if they want specific assistance by their reaction to your greeting.
<h> 4.  They talk to you really really s-l-o-o-o-w-l-y
<p> You've probably not listened to their questions and given them an answer that doesn't make sense.  Listen.  Make sure you're well versed in the subject or get somebody who knows to answer the questions, don't wing it or you'll fuck it up and end up refunding or comping the customer.  And they'll think you're an even bigger retard.
<h> 5.  Asking a lot of questions
<p> Chances are they're trying to get you to help them but you're not really being very forthcoming.  You might have said you don't have something in stock, but haven't offered to order it or find another store with it.  You might have sold them something that required accessories but didn't offer any help choosing them.  You might have taken a large order of food but not repeated it back to them.  Asking questions is a sign that the customer expects more from you.
<p> Ultimately, the most important thing to remember about customer service is that if a customer is an asshole, unless they've been like that from the moment they walked into the store, chances are you did something to cause it.
<p> My personal pet peeve is indifference.  I usually try to strike up a conversation with anyone serving me, even if it's just a passing comment, but if I get no reaction then I'll walk away thinking you're a bit simple.  After all, treat others the way you would like to be treated, yeah?
<p> And for goodness sake, remember that I genuinely couldn't give a shit about what crappy thing happened to you that morning.  Build a bridge and get over it, you're at work, not a frickin' counselling session.
<p> The Body Shop are notorious for this. You cannot step foot in that shop without 4 staff members constantly hounding you. Most of the time I just go in there to look around and see what new stuff they have in store, but literally the second I put my foot in the door they are all like "YOWHATSUP, WHATCANIHELPYOUWITH?" and I'm like "err...I just...want...to look" and they are like "ANYTHINGINPARTICULAR?" which then gets me into a snooty attitude and I just want them to back off and let me breathe.
<p> It's all because head offices have it in their heads that this is what the customer wants. The poor salesperson knows it isn't, but they're stuck with toeing the company line because otherwise they a) are stuck on minimum wage with no commission or b) get reprimanded for not 'greeting people'. It's counter-intuitive and times need to change.
<p> Ever noticed that you go into a clothing store and get completely ignored at the counter? It's because THE PERSON WHO GREETED YOU HAS CLAIMED YOU AND YOUR PURCHASE HAS TO GO TOWARDS THEIR TARGET. As in, they personally have to put it through or they might get a written warning for missing a sales target. Meanwhile, you're getting shitty because you're waiting at the counter and nobody will SELL YOU THE PRODUCT YOU ARE READY TO BUY. Not a great way to run a business, and unfortunately very common here in NZ :/
