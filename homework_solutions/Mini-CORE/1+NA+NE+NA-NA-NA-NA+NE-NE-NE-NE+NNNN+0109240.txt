<p> A newly married couple forced to live on 57 a week killed themselves in despair after being 'abandoned' by social services, their friends claimed yesterday.
<p> The bodies of Mark and Helen Mullins were found lying side by side at their run-down home in an apparent suicide pact.
<p> News of the tragedy emerged yesterday as friends told how they had been forced to live 'hand to mouth', making a weekly 12-mile trip to a soup kitchen on foot after Mrs Mullins' benefits were stopped 18 months ago.
<p> Mark and Helen Mullins: Lived in just one room of their run-down home
<p> Tragic: Mark and Helen Mullins could not face another freezing winter on the poverty line, according to neighbours
<p> Military man: Mr Mullins served as a PE teacher in the Army but fell on hard times after leaving the service
<p> The couple were given free vegetables at the soup kitchen in Coventry each Sunday, which they boiled into a broth on a camping stove.
<p> They lived in just one room of their terraced house to save on heating costs and could not afford a fridge so kept their food in plastic bags in the garden.
<p> They are believed to have killed themselves after 18 months of struggling to survive on the 57.50 Jobseeker's Allowance payment Mr Mullins, a 48-year-old former Army physical training instructor, was able to claim.
<p> Their heart-breaking plight was revealed yesterday, five days after their bodies were discovered at their council house in Bedworth, Warwickshire.
<p> Charity workers who befriended the couple said society had allowed them to 'slip through the net'.
<p> Mrs Mullins, 59, suffered from learning difficulties and social services are understood to have taken her 12-year-old daughter away last year after she was considered to be incapable of looking after her.
<p> As a result, her child benefits were stopped but she was ineligible to claim Jobseeker's Allowance because she was not deemed fit to work.
<p> She was also told she did not qualify for incapacity benefit because she had not been officially diagnosed with a medical condition.
<p> Mr Mullins was his wife's full-time carer. He fought to get a carer's allowance but was told he could not claim until she was diagnosed with a disorder.
<p> Run-down: The property that Mark and Helen Mullins shared as they lived on 57.50 per week
<p> Officers discovered their bodies after neighbours reported they had not been seen for some days. Kervin Julien, who runs the Salvation Army soup kitchen in Coventry used by the couple, said: 'The question needs to be asked -- why was it they felt they had no one else to turn to?
<p> 'It's sad that in this day and age we have still got prehistoric services that are not meeting the needs of the people who need them.'
<h> WHY THEY WERE LEFT ON 57.50 PER WEEK
<p> Mark and Helen Mullins were left living on a measly 57.50 per week in a run-down property which has now been boarded up.
<p> They would have received an additional 20.30 per week in child benefit before their 12-year-old was taken off them.
<p> Helen was not eligible for disability benefit despite having learning difficulties because they feared she would be put into care if the full extent of her problems were known, friends said.
<p> Mark had not been in the forces for long enough to claim a pension.
<p> Mr Julien, who appeared in TV programme The Secret Millionaire, added: 'They walked everywhere hand in hand, like young lovers.
<p> 'Mark talked about the authorities taking Helen's daughter away from her but not acknowledging her mental health problems.
<p> 'They had been staying with relatives and friends to try and avoid the authorities, as they believed they wanted to section Helen. They just wanted support.'
<p> It is understood the couple married in July last year, shortly after they appeared in an online documentary about people living below the poverty line in Warwickshire.
<p> Mr Mullins said in the interview: 'The job centre decided Helen couldn't sign on as she was incapable of employment as she has no literacy and numeracy skills.
<p> Mr and Mrs Mullins were forced to walk ten miles each week into Coventry city centre to a soup kitchen where they could get free vegetables
<p> 'However, the incapacity people wouldn't recognise her disabilities. We're in a catch 22 situation. We're living hand to mouth.'
<p> One neighbour said: 'The authorities turned their back on them.
<p> 'They obviously couldn't face another freezing winter and felt they had no other choice but to kill themselves.'
<p> Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Warwickshire County Council refused to comment because the couple are yet to be formally identified.
<p> A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'The couple in question had been receiving weekly benefits from the department since February 2010 - these included money for disability and caring responsibilities as well as out of work support.
<p> 'We had not received any complaint from them about their benefit claim.'

<p> @ Dieven Apologies if you have tried this already, but if you are looking at this thread, do contact the Citizens' Advice Bureau. I've been in a tricky situation with benefits recently and they can help. The number for the Wales CAB is 0844 477 2020.
<p> This is the face of the cuts that Osborne and Cameron refuse to see. This type of poverty in the 21st Century is unacceptable, ordinary people are suffering because of incompetent Politicians and greedy bankers. Will they bow their head in shame, what do you think?
<p> claiming benefits, partiuclarly for sickness and disability has become a nightmare. It's worst of all for genuine cases, because they are simply too sick, worn down and dispirited to cope. - yellinthedark, the land of panic, 11/11/2011 11:27
<p> You're quite right. Those who only pretend to have bad backs or bad nerves are well able to go to the offices and tribunals and state their case with some force. Those who genuinely have difficulty with movement or talking to people can't do that. The ones who get benefits aren't always the ones who should. This couple were let down by the very people, civil servants and charity workers, whose job it is to help those who need help.
<p> we had to live on 35 a week and there were 3 of us!! we went without food so our daughter could eat. We didn't get any help at all and nearly lost our house. no council tax help, no rental help. nothing. but we are still here. we had a fridge and other household items before hand so surely these 2 did aswell?
<p> If claiming benefits was really as simple as IDS and others in government claim, then how come this couple failed to get any help? Because the truth is different - that claiming benefits, partiuclarly for sickness and disability has become a nightmare. It's worst of all for genuine cases, because they are simply too sick, worn down and dispirited to cope.
<p> I have no income. I am too sick to work but am not given help. The council just stopped my housing benefit and have asked me to pay back 7000 within a month. I have nothing and now am facing homelessness in the next 4 or 5 weeks. They say its the 'law' that i am not entitled to anything as i am single and have no children. They say they paid me in error and now i owe them. I am trying to sell everything i own.... but i know that wont even cover half the cost. I phoned them and explained i have nothing... they said its tough, i have to pay, its the law....
<p> Government departments that don't talk and don't care. Left hand not knowing what the right is doing - always someone else's fault. There seem to be a lot of people passing judgement on this woman, illiterate, mental health issues but no-one firming it up with a definite diagnosis that will provide the help she needed. Will departments learn through this - I won't hold my breath.
<p> I'm so saddened by this. And yet, on the same page, we can delight vicariously in Blake Lively's new shoes, Rachel Ray's cleavage, Mel Gibson's "stunning brunette" and Brad and Angela's new Japanese baby toys. Seriously, people? It is time for change.
<p> Poor people how do all the caring / sharing people that the council / government employs let this happen. They would have been better trying to get to France, come back over on the Ferry and chuck their passports away. Get caught and refuse to tell people where they come from. 17K straight in their pockets from a Judge with benefits galore to follow.
