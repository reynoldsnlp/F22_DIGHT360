<p> I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I'VE CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT ONE THING BUT NOT ANOTHER. In case you're keeping track of the occasional Althouse post here on Instapundit, I feel compelled to tell you that there are 2 things I've talked about here that I've reconsidered in the last 24 hours. First, unlike seemingly everybody else, I did not think Obama did such a bad job at the debate. So I rewatched the debate, and I stand by my original observation (and I think I know why Obama's supporters decided to adopt the strange talking point that their guy was terrible).
<p> Second, I deplored the resurrection of the 2007 video of Obama stirring up racial grievances. Yesterday, I read this Thomas Sowell column highlighting a specific, glaring lie, and I completely changed my mind. I still think The Daily Caller presented the material poorly, but I think what Obama did, what Sowell explains, does deserve our attention now. As I say at my home blog : "Obama lied, blatantly and for the purpose of making black people feel discriminated against. That's evil."
