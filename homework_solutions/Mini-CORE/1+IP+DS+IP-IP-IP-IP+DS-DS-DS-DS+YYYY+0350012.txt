<h> About the Author
<p> Simon Brett, chairman of the Society of Wood Engravers, is a freelance artist, printmaker and prize winning book illustrator. He taught for 18 years, from 1970 to 1989, and has written widely on the history and practice of wood engraving, editing the Engravers handbooks for the Society of Wood Engravers and the Contemporary Wood Engravers series for Primrose Hill Press, as well as curating major exhibitions for the Society and for the British Council.
<p> This book is brilliant. It covers everything you could ever want to know about wood-engraving. From different ways to hold the tools, to material suppliers. It's to the point and has lots of illustrations depicting the different stages of engraving an image.
<p> I really must take issue with the reviewer who suggests this is not for beginners! I am such a one and have found this book extraordinarily interesting and helpful. It doesn't have the feel of a step by step manual, and the first chapter can lead the reader into areas which are probably a little too advanced. But as the author suggests, such sections can be skipped to be returned to later if necessary. (MY only slight complaint is that the notes at the end fail to give a reference which easily takes the reader back to the page where it originates: these endnotes are often like mini essays in their own right and can be read through in sequence, but occasionally one wishes to go back to the main text when doing this.)
<p> Anyone starting out will find endless resources here, from the most practical features, such as necessary tools and materials, to exploring the ways in which effects, such as creating depth in an image which could otherwise place all pictorial elements on the same plane, can be achieved. A number of times I have wondered if such and such a point might be covered, and generally, it is!
<p> One of the most useful sections is where the same image treated in a range of different ways is analysed and the results compared: this gives great food for thought in trying to improve one's own technique. (With this art form, once a mark is made it is almost impossible to return, so careful thought and planning is essential: this book encourages that kind of awareness.)
<p> Finally, the book is full of some wonderful examples of the author's and other engravers work.
<p> If you have ever wanted to learn wood engraving, this book has easy to follow instructions. It has much that you need to know. However for a beginner, I found there was not enough basic knowledge and samples here. This book is strong on samples of finished pieces by master engravers. Whilst this is a good handbook for anyone following an educational course, I don't think it is enough on its own for beginners. This review first appeared on Karen Platt's book review website.
