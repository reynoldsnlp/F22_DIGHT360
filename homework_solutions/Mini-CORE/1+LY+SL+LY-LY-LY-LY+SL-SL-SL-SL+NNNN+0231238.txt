<h> Why Don't We Do It In The Road Lyrics - The Beatles
<p> Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road No one will be watching us Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road No one will be watching us Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road Why don't we do it in the road No one will be watching us Why don't we do it in the road

<p> A male [monkey] just hopped on the back of this female and gave her one, as they say in the vernacular. Within two or three seconds he hopped off again and looked around as if to say, 'It wasn't me,' and she looked around as if there'd been some mild disturbance ... And I thought ... that's how simple the act of procreation is ... We have horrendous problems with it, and yet animals don't.
<p> The Inspiration | Reviewer: Hyena Dandy | 9/24/09
<p> Not to try to argue, but it is most definitely about sex. Paul said that when they were in India, he saw a couple of monkeys having sex in the middle of the road, and went off to write a song about it.
<p> It isn't so specific... | Reviewer: Anonymous | 7/16/09
<p> I think it's more about doing whatever it is you feel you should do in the road, in the open, without inhibitions. If something feels intuitively good and pleasurable to you, act upon it. This isn't specifically about sex, drugs, or anything else, it is about anything that can be done.
<p> WHY NOT | Reviewer: DJ | 1/29/08
<p> McCartney was inspired to right this while in India and he saw two monkeys just having sex in the open not caring what anybody else thought. this song does kick major ass. the beat is plain sick and the vocals are superb and awesome
<p> I was always told by my Beatle obsessed mother that it was about doing drugs (in the road). I think it was about doing cocaine in particular.
<p> Sexual freedom | Reviewer: Anonymous | 4/19/07
<p> As I see it, it picture what real sexual freedom would be : nobody would look because it would be so natural to make love anywhere. People would not have to hide to do it.
<p> Today on the opposite, pornography gives us the illusion of sexual freedom whereas it is the death of sexuality and sensuality. This is the political role of pornography : we forgot to fight for sexual freedom because we are deceived.
