<h> Black graduates are three times more likely to be unemployed than white within six months of leaving university, a study has revealed.
<p> Black graduates finding work can expect to earn as much as 9pc less for the same work as a white graduate over five years, the report by Deloitte showed.
<p> The study claims black students are not being given the "same opportunities" as white students. It follows a controversial report in February which suggested there was a "racial bias" against black candidates during recruitment.
<p> The study, published on Tuesday by the think tank Bow Group and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, warns that black students do not believe there is enough mentoring or assistance in choosing where to go to university or where to find jobs.
<p> Samuel Kasumu, founder of Elevation Networks, said: "We found black students are concerned about what their future once they graduate, many of them believe the odds are firmly stacked against them.

<p> "There are particular challenges when it comes to those students who are considering a career in financial services, legal services, government, and media, which is very concerning.
<p> "With the increase in tuition fees, there has never been a more important time to ensure all graduates have an equal chance in the employment market."
<p> Sandra Kerr, director of Race for Opportunity, which published the February report on racial bias, said: "This report reiterates our understanding that the top universities and businesses -- particularly in government, law, media, fashion and finance -- have a long way to go in being approachable to potential new candidates from diverse backgrounds.
<p> "Universities and businesses continue to be restrictive in how they recruit pupils and graduates. There is work to be done by each in assessing not only how formulaic their processes are, but also how diverse their current and most recent candidate shortlists are. Failing to widen their recruitment pool means UK businesses are losing out on a wealth of diverse skills and talent."
<p> Among the findings, the report found just under half of black undergraduates believed Government departments discriminate against black students in their employment policies.
<p> Almost seven in 10 expect to be earning less than 25,000 in their first graduate role.
<p> There is a "vast discrepancy" between the expectations of black students and the outcomes they face following graduation, the report based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years, finds.
<p> Terry Awan, head of the multi-cultural network at Deloitte, said: "The findings of this report are truly worrying, and not something that should be happening in working environments in the 21st century.
<p> Elevation Networks said employers should target graduate recruitment days at univeristies they traditionally do not use, to increase diversity in applications.
