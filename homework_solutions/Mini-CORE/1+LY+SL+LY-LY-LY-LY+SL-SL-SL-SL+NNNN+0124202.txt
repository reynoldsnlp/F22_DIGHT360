<h> Be Good To Each Other Lyrics
<h> Phil Stacey
<p> May the road rise to meet us Wind always be at our back As we follow our dreams May our hearts ever lead and not lose track May we smile at the end of the day May we always find a way To be good to each other To be good to each other Well, there's already plenty of pain In this world to last for years Yeah, just look out any window There's heartache and sorrow and tears It's easy to see what we need Now really how hard could it be To be good to each other Yeah, be good to each other We could try a little tenderness Yeah, and see how we like it It just might bring out our very best If we keep love in sight And be good to each other Yeah, be good to each other La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Oh whoa, oh whoa La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Oh whoa, oh whoa I'm sorry for times When I've added fire to the fuel For the times when I've hated Been bitter and jaded and cruel We get what we give in return Maybe as we live we will learn To be good to each other To be good to each other We could try a little tenderness Yeah, and see how we like it It just might bring out our very best If we keep love in sight And be good to each other Yeah, be good to each other La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Oh whoa, oh whoa La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Oh whoa, oh whoa Be good to each other Yeah, be good to each other Oh, be good to each other Yeah, be good to each other Oh, be good to each other Be good to each other Oh, be good
