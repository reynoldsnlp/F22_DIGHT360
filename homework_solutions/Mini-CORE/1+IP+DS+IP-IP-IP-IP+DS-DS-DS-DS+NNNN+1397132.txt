<h> More About the Author
<p> Guy Harris introduces himself as The Recovering Engineer. With experience and training in chemical and nuclear engineering, service as a nuclear engineering officer in the U.S. Navy submarine fleet, and work in the chemical industry; Guy knows the struggles of people with a technical background who find themselves in a role that demands they work with people.
<p> Guy has learned the skills of working with people through both study and struggle. He now works as an author, trainer, executive coach, and consultant on the topics of workplace conflict resolution, team dynamics, and leadership development.
<p> As the owner of an executive search firm, I continually look for resources to improve my and my staff's productivity. Most information available is technique-driven, one-size fits all - providing an initial boost, but no long term results. Implementing the Sell Naked approach has increased my company's bottom line already, with no lag in sight. Our clients and candidates have stated that they feel we really understand them, their goals, their agenda. We've initiated deals we couldn't have without this inforamtion; we've closed deals that we couldn't have previously. I've observed a fundamental increase in my staff's self-confidence and greater efficiency - interesting, with no addtional "technical/product" knowledge, just leveraging their existing knowledge base. Lastly, an unexpected benefit for us has been our improved relationships with family and spouses...not a stated benefit in the typical business training, but real, nonetheless.
<p> I have had the honor of seeing Joe and Dawn speak.

Joe and Dawn's book Sell Naked on the Phone comes from real life experience and success which they have obtained involving over a decade worth of valuable Information in the industry of sales involving the phone. This book will teach you from understanding personalities, to increasing you appointment shows, and much more! Give yourself the gift of increasing your income with the information in Sell Naked on The Phone by Joe and Dawn Pici.
<p> As the owner of Integrity Management Solutions Group, this book will be a tool I will use in training. The techniques taught in this book are the way to build a solid foundation to any phone and sales training material. I intend to use Joe and Dawn's products in the training I do with my clients, as this is the most direct approach I have seen available on the market today.
