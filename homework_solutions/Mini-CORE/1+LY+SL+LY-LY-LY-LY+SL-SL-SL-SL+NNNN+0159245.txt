<h> The Greatest Lyrics
<h> Cat Power
<p> Once I wanted to be the greatest No wind or waterfall could stall me And then came the rush of the flood The stars at night turned deep to dust Melt me down into big black armor Leave no trace of grace just in your honor Lower me down to culprit south Make 'em wash a space in town For the lead and the dregs of my bed I've been sleeping Lower me down, pin me in Secure the grounds for the later parade Once I wanted to be the greatest Two fists of solid rock With brains that could explain Any feeling Lower me down, pin me in Secure the grounds For the lead and the dregs of my bed I've been sleeping for the later parade Once I wanted to be the greatest No wind or water fall could stall me And then came the rush of the flood The stars at night turned deep to dust
