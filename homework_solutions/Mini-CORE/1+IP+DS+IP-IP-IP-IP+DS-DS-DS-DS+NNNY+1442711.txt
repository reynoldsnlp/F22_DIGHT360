<p> We know what you need to succeed in the martial art industry. What you need is real, marketable, recognizable, branded protocols to build a successful martial art business. You just cant do this alone . More importantly you need to be different than the competition.
<p> Don't copy your competition, this will never lead to success, instead become a category of one. Crazy Monkey will allow you to do this. Not only do we have a super functional modern martial art program, but our program is safe, designed for people who only train a couple of hours a week, and most importantly still honors the life performance aspect of martial art training. Bottom line, while most other martial art styles, systems and schools still focus only on teaching people to 'fight', we coach people to LIVE. This is why our motto is;
<p> Preparing Our Clients for the Martial Arts of Everyday Life.
<p> People training in martial arts may or may not ever need the martial skills they are taught, but they will always need, and use the life performance coaching tools we coach as part of the Crazy Monkey Defense Program.
