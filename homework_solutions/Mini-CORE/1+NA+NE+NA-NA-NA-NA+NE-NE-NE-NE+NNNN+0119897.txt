<h> New Leader Tells Tories They Have to Be Tough Against Labor
<p> Seeking to end damaging party quarrels and bolster his own unproven leadership, William Hague told Conservatives today that they had to be tough with the Labor Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair.
<p> ''It's time to take off the gloves and punch our weight,'' Mr. Hague said in a speech notable more for its philosophy than specific proposals.
<p> He laid out a ''British way'' to combat Mr. Blair's vaunted ''third way.'' And on the issue that has divided the party and the conference, he said, ''The British way is to be in Europe but not run by Europe.''
<p> The Conservatives, he said, had to become known as ''the party of personal liberty'' to provide favorable contrast to the ''bossy'' Labor Party, which, he argued, is turning Britain into ''a nanny state.''
<p> He said that his party had learned the need to ''listen to Britain'' from its trouncing in the last election and that party workers now reported a falloff in the ''the old hostility that greeted us on the doorstep.'' He acknowledged that the party had yet to turn that into enthusiasm, saying that was the mission before them.
<p> In the weeks before the conference Mr. Hague tried to put an end to squabbling over Europe by holding a ballot of party members and announcing the verdict on the eve of the gathering. The referendum asked whether they supported Mr. Hague's position of keeping Britain out of the European single currency for at least the next eight years.
<p> He obtained the electoral results he wanted -- 84 percent of the voters endorsed his policy -- but not the results he sought for party peace. Although Mr. Hague said the outcome proved that his view was now ''the settled will'' of the party, opponents argued that the turnout was only 58 percent and that, therefore, the support for the policy among all party members amounted to less than half, or 49.6 percent.
<p> More critically for the party prospects for unity, some major Conservative figures with broad popularity and tested experience in the party assailed the policy and said they would continue to.
<p> Chief among them were Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minster under John Major and Kenneth Clarke, former Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<p> Europe is an issue that dogged the Tories through the last of their 18 years in Government and produced the disarray that contributed to the size of their defeat in the election of May 1, 1997. That was the worst loss for the Conservatives since 1832, costing the party all its seats in Scotland and Wales and delivering a 179-member Parliamentary majority to Labor.
<p> Mr. Blair kept Britain out of the first wave of 11 nations that are entering the monetary union but has broadly hinted that if conditions are favorable the country will sign up at the second entry point, expected to be in 2002.
<p> A strong undercurrent ran through the four-day conference over whether Mr. Hague, clever and congenial but so far unconvincing, was proving to be a leader of the stature to pull the depleted and dispirited Conservatives back into power.
<p> As the conference opened on Tuesday, a Gallup poll in The Daily Telegraph showed the Conservatives with the support of 23 percent of the electorate, down from its already dismal 31 percent in the election, and Labor at 57 percent, 13 points higher than its total then.
<p> Mr. Hague, 37, is the youngest party leader since 24-year-old William Pitt led the Tories in 1783. But he is a more experienced observer of British politics than his age and his stint of only three years in Mr. Major's Cabinet would suggest.
<p> In seeking to stress unity the conference brought to the stage two former Prime Ministers, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, who have carried on a personal vendetta in the 22 years since the latter replaced the former as party leader.
<p> They have not exchanged a word in all that time, and they remained separated and silent in back-to-back armchairs throughout their appearance. The display underlined the division in the party, as Mrs. Thatcher, an opponent of further integration with Europe, gleefully applauded speakers who pledged to protect the pound, and Mr. Heath, an advocate of a closer ties to Europe, kept his hands folded in his lap.
