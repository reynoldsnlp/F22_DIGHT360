<p> This is such a sweet story, a real lesson in how shy children can make good friends, and fulfill their dreams. The best thing about Blue's Clues is the spirit of friendship and respect among all of the characters. My daughter absolutely loves this book.
<p> "I Want to be in the Show!" is a rare "Blue's Clues" book based directly one of the stories from the show. This is a version of "Blue's Big Musical Movie" and featuring Sidetable (Drawer)'s story. Everyone's holding a big music show. Sidetable wants to sing in the show, but she keeps getting stuck with boring jobs. She just needs a little help to speak up for herself.
<p> This book has a bit different feel from some of the others. For one thing, the font being used a bit larger and more stylized than the normal font used in the books. Something about the overall look of the coloring feels a bit different and the story starts on the same page as the Note to Parents. None of this detracts from the story, though, which is quite enjoyable.
<p> In the Note to Parents, it says that the book stresses empowerment and they hope it will teach kids "they can be anything they want to be." Certainly a nice lesson, and very Blue's Clues.
