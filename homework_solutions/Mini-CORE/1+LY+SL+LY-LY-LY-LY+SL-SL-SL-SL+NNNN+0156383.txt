<h> Wish that I was Dead Lyrics
<h> Dwarves
<p> &lt;i&gt;[spoken:]&lt;/i&gt; Life is uncertain, but death is sure Well I wish that I was dead, yeah I wish that I was dead. They told me life is but a dream, but all I dream are tragic scenes, to be alive, I just don't care, eternal questions everywhere. Sometimes in life we stumble, oh Lord and we fall. [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/wish-that-i-w\\... ] I want to end it all, to end it all. You'll find me hanging from a tree, or underneath the deep blue sea. It doesn't matter where I lie, the graveyard or the highway side
