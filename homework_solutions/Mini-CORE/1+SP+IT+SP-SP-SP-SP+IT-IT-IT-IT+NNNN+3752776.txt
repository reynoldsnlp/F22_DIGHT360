<p> Stevenson's story blew my mind! Not only was she writing about the best city around, but she was a young travel writer that I could relate to, she was hilarious, and she was insightful. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before (esp. from the Toronto Star !).

<p> About a year ago I lead a talk at Brock University's Alumni Weekend called the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Blogosophere." It was a multi-media presentation that took people through 20 of the most interesting and extraordinary blogs/bloggers around. Reb easily made the list.
<p> When someone asked me what I predicted for the future of the blogopshere and successful blogs, I pointed to Reb.
<p> Stevenson's website ( www.rebstevenson.com ) currently features her two latest travel series: " Reb Across the Pond " where she covers Wales, Scotland and England, and " Retro Road Trip, " where she blogs about her 14-day road trip across Canada via that Trans Canada Highway.
<p> She covers a lot more than just travel too. Hint: Do you like cooking or crafts?
<p> And, of course, the reason I'm happy to profile her, is that she also happens to know a thing or two about New York City!
<p> So without further adieu, watch this video and be sure to read the humorous & tip-filled Q & A below!
<h> Q & A
<p> On your first trip to NYC, what do you wish you knew then, that you know now? I wish I'd known that it was a poor choice to sleep in a 4-person hostel room with two bunk beds. I was on top. A freewheelin' Aussie dude was on the bottom. I awoke in the middle of the night to an "earthquake." I realized I was now in a 5-person hostel room.
<p> What's something that has surprised you about New York City? How friendly the locals are. I know that's a brutal cliche, but I really believe that New Yorkers in general are REALLY happy to live where they do. Must be all those celeb sightings. I mean, wouldn't you be proud of your city if you routinely spotted celluloid deities in sloppy sweatpants, unwashed hair and Uggs making their way to the corner store?
<p> If "The Big Apple" didn't become New York's nick name, what do you think it could have been? Gozer's Playground
<p> In all your travels, what do you think makes New York unique (& so supposedly loveable) ? Movies. It's been so glorified in American cinema that you feel like you're in a movie when you're there. Only nobody is shooting at you, which is a bit of a bummer but it makes your trip to Bloomingdales a bit easier.
<p> "When I grow up, I hope to be wise but childish," says Stevenson.
<p> If you could only pick three things to do in NYC, what would they be? 1) Go to a taping of Letterman 2) See Times Square at night (seems too obvious, but I bet some poor souls miss it), 3) Walk from downtown to uptown.
<p> When you take your next trip to NYC, do you have anything in mind that you would you like to see, do, or experience? Actually, my boyfriend has a series of internet videos featuring puppets ( www.pancakemanor.com ), and we are hoping to score a Sesame Street set visit!
<p> Any celebrity spottings in NYC, or on other travel adventures for that matter? Apart from attending a Letterman taping, which doesn't count...hmmm...I've seen Jerry Seinfeld on the street in Seattle and John Cleese in London. I'm probably forgetting a bunch of actors. Cleese and Seinfeld are far more impressive to me because they're writers. I'd much rather meet Stephen Merchant than Brad Pitt. Oh, that reminds me, I have seen Brad Pitt up close. Unlike many leading actors he is actually tall enough to ride the Krazee Koaster at the fun fair.
<p> What's a couple pieces of advice that you typically give new or fellow travellers? Walk, don't bypass small towns, and leave the anvil at home. Take the tiny travel anvil.
<p> As a female travel expert, do you have any special tips for women travelling in big cities like NYC? Sometimes, breasts come with a hefty price tag, even if they're 100% real. Being a woman does affect the way you can travel, no doubt about it. Fearing for your safety in a strange setting shouldn't be part of anyone's travel memories. If you're travelling alone then focus on daytime activities. Go home early, stick to busy areas if you do stay out late, don't get drunk and don't accept any man's "friendship" too readily. "Friendship" in this case is defined as a man exposing himself before an official introduction. I have to say, however, that I've always felt relatively safe in NYC.
<p> Some say there's a difference between a traveler and a tourist? Do you agree? I'm guessing it's "travelers" who are making this distinction to make themselves feel all cultured and sensitive. I guess what they're getting at is that some people barely know where they are, have a superhuman ability to smell the McDonalds from 10 miles away, never speak with a local and buy a hat with plush moose antlers on it thinking they've summed up Canada. That would probably be the "tourist."
<p> In a nutshell, how would you describe your creative style or approach to your work? My goals are to 1) Write what I want to read 2) Make videos that don't take peoples' time for granted. There is so much material to choose from online, you're competing with the entire world! You can't just serve up crap and expect the internet to feast on it like it's a juicy steak. Or a nut roast (if you're vegetarian).
<p> You've chosen to live in Victoria, BC. So I guess you're not a Big City kind of girl? Not for full-time living. I like green spaces in which less than 40 % of the space is dedicated to heroin use, mugging and public urination.
<p> Regis or Kelly? I'm not that familiar with Regis' work, to be honest. I did see some of Kelly recently, though. So Regis. Definitely Regis.
<p> Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese? I'm assuming you're asking which one plays a meaner clarinet. I'd have to go Allen on that one.
<p> Tina Fey or Julia Louis-Dreyfus? Why isn't Toonces one of the choices?
<p> Seinfeld or Friends? Seinfeld. If Larry David had bestowed his midas touch upon Friends, it might have been a different story.
<p> Late Night with Jimmy Fallon or Late Show with David Letterman? I go to bed at 10pm. REM is always the musical guest on my late night show. *cough*
<p> How do you like them Big Apples? They're too big.
<p> Anything else you'd like to share? A piece of this damned apple.
