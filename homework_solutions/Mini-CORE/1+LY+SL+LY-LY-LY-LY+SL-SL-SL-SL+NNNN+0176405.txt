<h> King Of Might Have Been lyrics
<h> Chicago King Of Might Have Been lyrics
<p> What have I done? And why do people run away From what they really want? She? she was the one I know it now, just like a blind man feels the setting sun. Once Upon A Time I had everything I ever wanted Everything I'd need The more she tried to give me The more I took for granted Her majesty, and I can??t believe... Chorus: Oh, it??s really over now And I??ve got to live without The love I??ll never have again If this is what losing means Well, then I??ve lost everything Now I??m the? King of Might Have Been. I??m all alone With a hundred percent of nothing now Just a Fool upon his throne, She??s? she??s moving on She??s gonna be somebody??s everything And I hope that he knows? That all she ever needed Was the chance to be completed And to feel the light of love, What should've been, what could've been, Doesn??t matter now She??s history And I can??t believe? (Chorus) If I could do it all again I would never let it end I'd fight for us If I just had one more chance (Chorus) [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/chica\\... ]
