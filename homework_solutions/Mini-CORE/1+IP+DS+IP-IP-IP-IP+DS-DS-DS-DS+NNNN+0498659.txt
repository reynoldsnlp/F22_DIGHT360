<p> Following the side-splitting debut of their brand new show In The Middle Of No One at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival earlier this year and hot on the heels of sell out runs at Soho Theatre and The Edinburgh Festival and a UK tour, The Pajama Men make their West End debut at the Charing Cross Theater this Winter.
<p> Their unique brand of comedy which requires no more than their pajamas and an endless assembly of voices has consistently wowed audiences and critics wherever The Pajama Men have played over the past few years and has built up an ever growing army of enthusiastic fans.
<p> In The Middle of No One sees a lone explorer leave his wife and child behind in search of things most people have never seen, let alone know about.
<p> Meanwhile a dimwitted and affable, genius space-man (who discovered time-travel in a morally confusing way) struggles to make the right decision by doing exactly the wrong thing. You'll also meet; some vicious housewives, a gigantic sea monster known only as the Ice Beast, an unhelpful robot, a very rare bird and more, as the Pajama Men jump from character to character in the blink of an eye.
<p> Over the past seven years the PJs have won numerous comedy awards, critical acclaim and cult-like following across the US, UK and Australia. They've amused audiences as well as themselves with runs at The St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, and a sold out season at the Sydney Opera House. In 2010 they broke all previous box office records at London's Soho Theatre.
