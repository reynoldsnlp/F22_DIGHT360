<p> I quite enjoyed this - but I think it could have been made clearer that it is a collection of short stories. I read the sample on Amazon, and thought it looked interesting - but when I bought the book I found there was only another ten minutes' worth of that story.
<p> I have enjoyed the other Tim Ellis books I've read - but I prefer it when he takes the time to develop a full storyline.
<p> Tim Ellis is a brilliant writer, once you start you do not want to put them down and this is no exception modern and up to present time fast and twists and turns but not that you can not follow the story great detail would highly recommend his books
