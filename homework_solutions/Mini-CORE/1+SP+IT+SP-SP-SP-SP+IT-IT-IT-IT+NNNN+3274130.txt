<h> Michael Harlan Turkell: Back of the House
<p> Michael Harlan Turkell is a documentarian when it comes to the restaurant world. His " Back of the House " photography project narrates the lives of chefs in their restaurant worlds. His radio show, Food Seen (which, weather allowing, The New Potato will be appearing on tomorrow, October 30th) hosts guests that work at the intersection of food and art -- a marriage we love here at The New Potato. We decided to turn the tables on Turkell, photographing him at The Brooklyn Farmacy where he is currently working on his latest photography project, and getting his take on the world of food and art...
<p> What is your ideal food day?
<p> I'm not much of a breakfast person. Well, that's not true. I love leftovers: cold pizza, cold fried chicken, cold noodle dishes from all ethnicities. Dinner for breakfast may trump breakfast for dinner. Though, my Francophile self, thinks a croissant and a caf noir "c'est bon" [is good!]. Lunch, hmm. I don't know if I eat meals like that. I'm a grazer, going from place to place, having a little bit here and there. I'd start with oysters. Raw. Just on the half-shell. I like shucking my own. No condiments, not even a lemon. Just as is -- pure, unembellished. Lately, I prefer smaller west coast ones like Kumamotos, Kushis and Shigokus. And bread too -- crusty, warm, with room temperature butter on the side. Might begin the day with some bubbles, as well. I love Champagne. I like other sparkling wines, but I truly and deeply love Champagne. From there, I'd most likely try to find water -- not to drink, but to look at while continuing to drink. You can do that all at Hog Island in Tomales Bay, California, but here in New York, most good oyster bars feel landlocked. ( Grand Central Oyster Bar doesn't even have daylight!) I like walking and eating, so things that travel well and fit in the palm of my hand work best. A favorite is Christie's Jamaican Beef Patties on Flatbush. You can have them on coco-bread, but that's a nap waiting to happen. Due to my pedestrian snacking, I often have a stack of napkins in my pocket. I guess I'm a fish guy. Some crudo, sushi, cured salmon, smoked trout, pickled herring; any/all of it would be a fitting "lunch". Might walk around a bit more before finding a piece of pizza, and if I'm feeling very hungry, a corner Sicilian slice. I don't have much of a sweet tooth when it comes to desserts, but I heart candy. Sour gummies, specifically. Might head over to Economy Candy and grab a few treats for my travels.
<p> I'm not sure what time of day I'm at yet, but I'd most likely find a cheese board and salumi, with a nice bottle of Cru Beaujolais. Might think about fish again -- fried this time -- whitebait, clams, calamari...a full out fritto misto. Maybe a bit of beef tartare, with the traditional accoutrements; cornichons, whole grain mustard, baguette (grilled bread is best!). And then nice crisp salad with a bright, acidic dressing with a round of late-night oysters (again) and a negroni on the rocks as a nightcap. And I'd do it all again the next day!
<p> What made you start your "Back of the House" series?
<p> I was working in kitchens, having been attracted to the idea of working in one since high school. When I took my first documentary photo class, it just made sense. First I took pictures of my prep work and plating in order to assemble a manual for myself on how to cook, but it was the people, the places and the stories behind them that caught my eye more than the beauty shot of a finished dish. I started shooting the BACK OF THE HOUSE over a decade ago and my love for the industry grew with every photo taken. I kept documenting the lives of chefs in kitchens, which eventually led me away from the line, and out in the field, meeting the growers and makers who are the cogs of the industry. I don't see an end in sight for this project. It's a constant source of inspiration. I hope to archive what I've seen, heard and subsequently learned, in book form someday. If there's one thing I've taken away, it's the ultimate power that food has to convey a message.
<p> How do you go about shooting your subjects in their element/kitchen?
<p> Observation first. I watch how they work, try to understand their flow, and then figure out how I can fit into that. It's a collaborative process, as is running a restaurant. You can't do it alone. You have to take cues from each other, find opposite but complimentary angles. You have to have patience and know the shot is going to come. It's about respect -- for their space, time, and how they want to portray themselves. The honesty in showing what people do means a lot to me.
<p> What makes them comfortable?
<p> The shared knowledge. The footwork. Understanding where to stand and when to get out of the way. There are calms and swells during service, and you have to know when to be in the mix, and when to wait quietly. I don't stage anything; I wait for it to all happen naturally. As in all kitchens, there are foundations and procedures on how to go about things. Since these actions are repeated over and over daily, I know I'll most likely have another opportunity to catch that same image.
<p> Which shoots are particularly memorable to you?
<p> A morning spent next to Polane's century-old basement bread oven in Paris, when my lens fogged up and I just inhaled the experience. The early morning shifts at Flour Bakery in Boston, watching bread rise way before the sun came up. Rooftop Honey in Manhattan, smoking bees out of their hives and having them flying into my lens. Breaking down a 450lb sow in the field and keeping all the offal intact -- not wasting a part. I'm going lobstering soon for a shoot, and I've been dreaming about being on that boat, soaking it in with all my senses.
<p> What about food and restaurant photography is different from other areas of photography?
<p> I think it becomes better the more you know your subject. Be it photographing soup or a chef, coming in with either an inherent or studied knowledge of what you're about to work with is essential. I don't know if it's different than other forms of photography, but the preconception of what I do is often wrong. Everyone thinks it's just props and tabletops. I do shoot that -- and love doing so = but food photography can be verit too! It can be real, and not staged. I tend to lean towards that naturally-occurring aesthetic.
<p> You were once an aspiring chef. What inspired you to get behind the camera?
<p> Happenstance. Once I realized that I could be more frenetic, and get in more kitchens with a camera, I saw my point of view on food change. I always thought you had to strive to become a chef in order to be involved in the restaurant industry, but now I know I can do more good as a photographer than I ever could as a cook.
<p> Do you think having a chefs background helps you connect with your subjects?
<p> Of course -- plus I feel like I get a free education with every shoot I go on. I ask questions about techniques, origins, inspiration, and try to incorporate that into the story I shoot (and, admittedly, my cooking at home). I try to work with passionate people who are as into the food as I am, so there's already a rapport there.
<p> What is your favorite city to shoot in?
<p> Ha! Funny enough, I'd probably say Paris. Its airiness, open spaces, light quality; all these things lend themselves to the frame. The only thing is, I haven't taken many photographs there. I just went there for vacation, and barely used my camera. I love New York for shooting tight and detail oriented -- you can really zoom in here. There's also great luminescence at all hours of the day. Because of the way Manhattan is set up as a grid, all the angles and shadows interplay in the most magical ways.
<p> What is your favorite city for food? Where do you go when you're there?
<p> I don't want to short any city, and like my ideal food day, I go to specific places for certain things. There's something about New England that has a hold on me lately. Red's Eats in Wiscasset, Maine is most definitely worth the wait in line for a lobster roll. I love all the breads from Standard Baking Co. in Portland, Maine, especially the olive one. I'll go for any bivalve/mollusk from Cape Cod during the late summer/early fall, on the Atlantic side of the boot. Definitely Boston, because that's where I spent my formative years of college and cooking. There, I like to sit at No. 9 Park's bar for Prune Stuffed Gnocchi with Foie Gras and Vin Santo Glaze. And then there's Clio's Uni bar , which is so innovative and precise -- so forward thinking. And Coppa for casual but smart small plates. And Island Creek Oyster Bar for...oysters. Flour Bakery for all things baked -- the sticky buns are a must. The drinks at Drink are so crafty and perfectly crafted. Siena Farms is a great stop for their excellent produce -- and the fact they carry Sofra bakery sweets and spreads helps too! I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Anna's Taqueria , my burrito lifeblood during school.
<p> How do you feel about being in front of the camera?
<p> I dislike my photo being taken so much so, that I sometimes start to feel bad for my subjects. But then once I get behind the lens, all that goes away.
