<h> Book Description
<p> Release Date: March 2, 2004
<p> In mid-1943 James Megellas, known as "Maggie" to his fellow paratroopers, joined the 82d Airborne Division, his new "home" for the duration. His first taste of combat was in the rugged mountains outside Naples.
<p> In October 1943, when most of the 82d departed Italy to prepare for the D-Day invasion of France, Lt. Gen. Mark Clark, the Fifth Army commander, requested that the division's 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Maggie's outfit, stay behind for a daring new operation that would outflank the Nazis' stubborn defensive lines and open the road to Rome. On 22 January 1944, Megellas and the rest of the 504th landed across the beach at Anzio. Following initial success, Fifth Army's amphibious assault, Operation Shingle, bogged down in the face of heavy German counterattacks that threatened to drive the Allies into the Tyrrhenian Sea. Anzio turned into a fiasco, one of the bloodiest Allied operations of the war. Not until April were the remnants of the regiment withdrawn and shipped to England to recover, reorganize, refit, and train for their next mission.
<p> In September, Megellas parachuted into Holland along with the rest of the 82d Airborne as part of another star-crossed mission, Field Marshal Montgomery's vainglorious Operation Market Garden. Months of hard combat in Holland were followed by the Battle of the Bulge, and the long hard road across Germany to Berlin.
<p> Megellas was the most decorated officer of the 82d Airborne Division and saw more action during the war than most. Yet All the Way to Berlin is more than just Maggie's World War II memoir. Throughout his narrative, he skillfully interweaves stories of the other paratroopers of H Company, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The result is a remarkable account of men at war.

<h> Editorial Reviews
<h> From Publishers Weekly
<p> What World War II Lieutenant Megellas's memoir lacks in narrative force and elegance it makes up for in its unvarnished contribution to the historical record. Megellas was a senior at Ripon College in Ripon, Wis. during the Pearl Harbor attack; barely six months later, he had reported for duty and soon was enlisted in the storied 82nd Airborne Division. Landing in Italy on the eve of the Anzio invasion in the fall of 1943 and fighting his way through the mountainous Italian terrain, Megellas was wounded and then hospitalized ("I'm very fortunate to be alive," he wrote in a letter home. "I'm not certain as to how many Germans I killed but in my mind the minimum is at least 10"). In September 1944, Megellas's unit parachuted into Holland to take part in the bloody Operation Market Garden, in which the Allies lost more men than they would during the Normandy invasion. Megellas's description of his unit crossing the Waal River in rowboats under point-blank German fire is harrowing; that the soldiers reached the far shore and took the German positions is nothing short of a miracle. From there, Megellas and his men proceeded into the thick of the Battle of the Bulge and onward to the Rhine, fighting as they made their way toward Germany. Just as revealing as the battle accounts are Megellas's stories of the numbing boredom that soldiers in rear positions waiting for orders to the next engagement experienced, as well as the countless small acts of bravery and the daily hardships. Foregoing the romanticized hero-worship of some wartime accounts, Megellas recalls his two years of duty in the 20th century's deadliest war with admirable restraint.

<p> Some may say Megellas is self-congratulatory, brutal, tasteless. Others will say he is an ultimate hero. His own account indicates to me he is like many men, somewhere between hero and villain.
<p> And his account is above all else, frank and honest.
<p> Megellas was not a cook, senior officer, engineer. His Military Occupational Specialty was as he says plainly to "kill Germans". Megellas makes it clear that persevering amidst so much death required an unpleasant "kill or be killed", "war is hell" mentality. Megellas admits he was brutal but that so were the Germans and that killing can get personal if a buddy is killed.
<p> If you like the clean Patton, Ike, Hollywood portrayals of D-Day and Market Garden, this book is not for you. He doesn't hide his grunt's contempt for higher-ups (Colonels and higher) or rear echelon support types. Nor does he hide the savage behavior of war-hardened troopers: looting dead Germans, his own stealing of wine from a church.
<p> The book is good for authentic accounts of patrols, army jargon, equipment (US and German), tactics, etc. Those who liked Band of Brothers may like this. I sure did.
<p> Is this book a glorification of war or a condemnation of its brutality?? It's hard to tell! The author disliked patriots at home who had an innocent view of war but he says clearly that the Germans and Italians deserved what they got.
<p> As one of the six Ripon College Grads who went to Ft. Knox with Jim mentioned in the book, I appreciated the Authors story. I am proud of Jim and all of his accomplishments. It was a great book, and greater story of many young men who saved the World.
<p> A mile a minute account of the 82nd airborne in combat. Filled with stunning combat scenes that leave you on the edge of your seat. His feelings for the German civilians and reflections on higher command give a unique perspective not scene in the war movies. This is the kind of book that you will call in sick to work just to stay home and read...its that good! WARNING, this book will get you hooked on war memoirs
