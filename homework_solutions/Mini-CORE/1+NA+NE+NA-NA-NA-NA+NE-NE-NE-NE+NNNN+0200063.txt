<h> CFMEU Organiser trespass charges struck out in a win for worker safety, wages and conditions
<p> The Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) Victorian and Tasmanian Branch welcomed the Magistrate's decision that there was no case to answer, having the matter of trespass charges against long-time organiser Bill White struck out.
<p> CFMEU State Secretary Bill Oliver said that it was a win for worker safety, wages and conditions in Tasmania.
<p> "Builders Fairbrothers called the police on July 20 after Bill White entered the site to discuss safety and pay matters with workers, contravening an existing agreement for right of entry.
<p> "The Magistrate has decided that there was no case to answer.
<p> "The CFMEU puts Fairbrothers on notice. We will defend our members and officials no matter what it takes.
<p> "There is no reason that Tasmanian building sites should be any different to those on the mainland. The same standards of safety and conditions should be maintained.
<p> "CFMEU officials are there to monitor safety concerns of the workers, and protect wages and conditions. It was legitimate business which Bill White was conducting, and there was no cause to forcibly remove him.
<p> "The CFMEU is fighting to improve the wages and conditions of Tasmanian workers which lag behind those on the mainland.
<p> "We will not give up this fight, until Tasmanian building workers are recognised as having the same rights as workers on other Australian building sites," said Mr Oliver.
