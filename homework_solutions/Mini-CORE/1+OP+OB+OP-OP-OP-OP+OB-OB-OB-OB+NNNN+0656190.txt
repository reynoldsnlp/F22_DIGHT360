<p> F or some time now the world has heard talk of the euro's demise and of a grim -- and perhaps even well-deserved -- collapse of the great European dream of monetary and economic union. For the euro's legion of skeptics, the breakup of the euro is seen as the right solution to the fiscal and banking crises that have now dragged down the world economy for more than three years.
<p> Some even speculate that Canada and the United States, by standing back from participation in European fiscal and banking support, are playing a calculating game that includes a willingness to let the euro die. U.S. president Barack Obama, in comments Friday, certainly left a European financial rescue to the Europeans. "These decisions are fundamentally in the hands of Europe's leaders," he said.
<p> 'Never before has there been a currency union that covers so large a share of the world economy and that has grown so successfully and so rapidly'
<p> In some circles, the euro should be abandoned. Economist Paul Krugman calls the euro "a mistake." MIT economist Simon Johnson wrote last month: "It is time for European and IMF officials, with support from the U.S. and others, to work on how to dismantle the euro area."
<p> Against these pessimists stands Robert Mundell, the Nobel economist whose brief 11-page 1961 paper, A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas , is widely credited as a founding document for the 1999 creation of the euro. Prof. Mundell, in an interview this week with FP Comment , is confident the euro will survive. To get to survival, however, will require forcing many difficult policy changes that are similar to the ones now contemplated by European leaders: greater shared fiscal responsibility, eurobonds and a unified banking system.
<p> Whether Prof. Mundell's confidence is warranted remains to be seen. In the meantime, it is worth considering the alternative. For euro critics, the answers seem simple enough. Wouldn't the world economy be a better place without the euro? Think of Greece: If the beleaguered Greek economy could just leave the euro and bring back its own currency, the drachma, the country's fiscal and regulatory problems could be fixed. All Greece would have to do is devalue the new drachma, thereby putting an end to the endless wrangling over bailouts and debts.
<p> Same with Spain, maybe, and Portugal. Wouldn't Ireland be better off without having to struggle under the distortions imposed by being part of the European Monetary Union, unable to control its own monetary policy and play with its own currency value? Such ideas have easy appeal, especially among theorists who never much liked the idea of a united European monetary system to start with.
<p> Underlying these positions is the assumption that there is a previous European currency regime that was somehow superior to the euro. But there is no such history. There was no time -- outside its brief membership in the Bretton Woods agreement at a fixed rate of 30 drachmas to the U.S. dollar -- when the Greek drachma floated freely in some glorious currency regime. Mostly, the drachma was a debauched currency that, when Greece joined the euro in 2002, had plunged to 400 drachmas to the dollar.
<p> Most of the other currencies in the euro today were victims of perpetual devaluation. The French franc, before being absorbed into the euro, could be used as the a poster currency for Keynes' famous adage: "The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens." It took 120 francs to buy a U.S. dollar in 1945, 350 in 1949 and 494 in 1959. Other devaluations followed.
<p> Europe has no other currency model to go back to, other than chaos. Few people look back fondly on the old European currencies that are absorbed into the eurozone: Belgian franc, Estonian kroon, Slovak koruna, Slovenian tolar, German mark, Irish pound, Greek drachma, Spanish peseta, French franc, Italian lira, Cypriot pound, Luxembourg franc, Dutch guilder, Austrian schilling, Maltese lira, Portuguese escudo.
<p> Even the early versions of monetary union were failures. Few people who dislike the euro mention one of its infamous predecessors, "the snake in the tunnel," which aimed to limit the ability of each country to manipulate its currency. The Wikipedia entry on the snake in the tunnel is laughable in itself as it describes the attempt to create a single currency band that supposedly pegged the key six European nations:
<p> [The agreement] set bands of +/-2.25% for currencies to move relative to their central rate against the US dollar. This provided a tunnel in which European currencies were to trade. However, it implied much larger bands in which they could move against each other: for example if currency A started at the bottom of its band it could appreciate by 4.5% against the dollar, while if currency B started at the top of its band it could depreciate by 4.5% against the dollar... The tunnel collapsed in 1973 when the US dollar floated freely. The snake proved unsustainable."
<p> It is easy and simplistic to muse about the collapse of the euro. It would also be dangerous within the context of the great achievement that has marked the euro so far. Prof. Mundell has it right. "Never before has there been a currency union that covers so large a share of the world economy and that has grown so successfully and so rapidly within the space of a decade and a half." Europe's fiscal and banking crisis was not caused by the euro and it would be disastrous to pretend that destroying the euro will solve Europe's problems. It may take time, but the euro still looks strong despite the endless crisis. There must be light, rather than snakes, at the end of the tunnel.
