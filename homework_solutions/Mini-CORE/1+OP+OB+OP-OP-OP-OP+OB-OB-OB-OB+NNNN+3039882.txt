<p> To hear John Strafford speak at the conference, one had to go through the main room, down a service corridor and into a tiny room in the corner of the "fringe" building. Tory CCHQ calls anyone speaking here "fringe", people like John Redwood, Roger Helmer, Chris Grayson and of course, John Strafford who writes today :
<p> The debacle last week regarding the Conservative candidate in Westminster North is the latest example of what happens when Central Office interferes in local associations. In the 45 years I have been a member of the -party, I have never known it to be more centrally controlled. Members have virtually no rights, and a small group dominates.
<p> I heard tales of new candidates "parachuted in " at the last stage in preselection when the constituency chairman makes the recommendations and these tales came from the floor. I sat in a packed auditorium and heard Jesse Norman disparage UKIP attempts to get a referendum as "lunatic fringe".
<p> David Cameron faced a revolt last night from Tory MPs who accused him of a 'Big Brother' attempt to censor their Election leaflets. They called the Conservative leader a 'control freak' after party managers issued a series of commands to prevent any gaffes.
<p> MPs were stunned last week to receive orders from Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin to submit Election leaflets for prior inspection. They were told that in future, they could put nothing in writing to their voters without first getting permission from the party leadership. And to the fury of veteran MPs, they were also ordered to use pictures of Mr Cameron in all their literature.
<p> Well, there's nothing new in the Conservative side getting behind a strong leader -- Churchill, Maggie -- but in the case of these two, the Tories had a leader with clear ideas and a conservative policy to promote. They trod on toes but their product, love it or loathe it, was consistent and people knew where they were.
<p> This man Cameron is being accused of being a control freak because of one factor -- he commands no respect -- he's a vaccilating piece of jelly who does precisely what Leo Amery noted about Herbert Asquith:
<p> For twenty years, he has held a season ticket on the line of least resistance and has gone wherever the train of events has carried him, lucidly justifying his position at whatever point he has happened to find himself. [Quarterly Review, July, 1914]
<p> So Cameron is nothing new and comes from a long line of less than would be leaders who are bereft of dignity and whom one can expect to break their promises at their earliest convenience. A promise to a Cameron is something to placate, to allay, to get him over the line and into power.
<p> The Conservative Party, of which I am a member, would be coming home with a wet sail now if we had a leader. Way back in 2007, the signs were there but the party decided to paper over the cracks and support the insupportable, someone who was always going to act this way.
<p> Naturally, England itself has now been betrayed by this man. Toque reports :
<p> David Cameron, who has consistently accused Labour of failing to address the West Lothian Question, and who has stated that such failure puts the Union at risk, should now expect the same accusations leveled at him. He has reneged on a promise made not only by him but also by the three Tory leaders before him (Hague, IDS and Howard).
<p> Why do Dave and his chums not simply parade wearing placards reading "Don't vote for us"? Their Green mania is as absurd as the Red garbage peddled by Mao and his minions half a century ago. It is good news, though, as it may help consign Dave to his proper destination -- the dustbin of history.
<p> ... and readers such as Clothilde S opined:
<p> Dave is a fool, who is unwilling to reverse some of the most damaging Labour policies. We've seen this on Europe, and now we're seeing it on so-called climate change. Gerald Warner is right: it is preposterous to have a shadow secretary for climate change -- you might just as reasonably appoint a minister for teaching pigs to fly, or a minister for turning lead into gold.
<p> Let's be honest -- many of the Tory policies are good and need to be in place, Cameron is wet behind the ears in so many ways and so the gaffes continue but the single greatest negative is that he is a politician without principle, a Blair clone who mouths trivialities and can't be trusted.  He has adopted Clarke's Labour clone policy on Europe and steered the whole party to the wet side, marginalizing the dry "nutters" as far as possible.
<p> Not only have many people wondered if Cameron wants to lose this election but whether he wants to split the Tories for once and for all.  There are two parties in one -- the Cameron-Clarkes and the True Conservatives -- and the latter are disenfranchised.
<p> Cameron should have gone in 2007 but Tories got behind him in a show of unity which was plain silliness.  He'll no doubt limp into office on a reduced mandate and though the parliament won't necessarily be hung, it will be a weak minority government trying to tackle massive problems head-on, without the wherewithal to do it.
<p> There is no disloyalty to Conservatism here, quite the opposite.  Cameron is no Conservative.  Let him head up his pro-EU party or the Labour Party or whatever but someone has to break the stranglehold he has on a once great party which has lost its roots and lost its way under his non-leadership.
<p> Cameron has just dumped English Votes on English Laws. Did he consult his MPs and candidates of whom, reportedly, 90%+ favour the policy? I doubt it.
<p> Why should we trust him to get rid of the regions in England? I don't trust him on anything, other than delivering the best for Scotland while screwing England, just as Labour has done for the past 13 years.
<p> As an Englishman there is one good reason I will not be voting Tory and that reason is Dave "I've got lots of Scottish blood in my veins" Cameron.
<p> Agreed. I did hope that Cameron was a better option than Brown & NuLab, that (in the main) fundamental issues such as WLQ & the EU Referendum would be addressed in some form. Now I see he is as hopeless a weak cowardly bully as Brown. Does the EU control this control freak?
<p> Not sure why I've made an appearance in this piece. But just for the record I went through the normal candidate selection procedure and was chosen on the first ballot in an open (anyone can vote) primary in December 2006.
<p> Also re: the EU I was one of the authors of Direct Democracy in 2005, which called for the repatriation of powers from the EU. And I strongly supported the referendum. These are matters of public record.
<p> Thanks for the comments but I'll need to address Jesse Norman's comment first and foremost. My notes from the conference [written during each session] indicate that Mr Norman did make the comment in the post, in answer to a question from the floor re the UKIP and that is as far as the comment went.
<p> The other things are well known in the public sphere -- his Direct Democracy, localist movement and so on, all good stuff. As I am not UKIP, I don't particularly have a barrow to push that way but I have noted a tendency for anti-EU forces to try to go it alone.
<p> The TPA have been reasonable about things but parties have tended to want to do it without reference to any other forces out there. For example, I see no sign of Jesse Norman's acknowledgement of our pledge but given his pro-referendum and anti-EU stance, one would have thought he'd have embraced support from the community.
<p> I am so not impressed with Cameron.. or generally even the Conservatives. I figure Cameron backing away from a referendum puts him in the "can't be trusted to do what he says" camp along with Labour.
<p> To be honest I was not planning to vote for Cameron.. but I so loathe what Labour have become I guess I would vote for virtually anyone who had a chance of getting them out. Shame we can't just replace 90 of all the politicians in parliament with some new (maybe even hones) ones really
<p> The only ones who have any real chance to get rid of Labour with their obsessive fascist control, corruption and lies are the Conservatives, so I guess I will have to hold my nose and vote for them if I ever finally get the chance.
