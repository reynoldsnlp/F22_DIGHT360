<h> The Beginning of Wisdom (Proverbs Vol 1)
<h> Quick Overview
<p> Learn what's at the heart of the difference between the wise and the foolish life. (7 Bible studies).
<p> Please note: these studies are due in from the printer soon.
<h> Product Description
<p> Proverbs is a favourite book of the Old Testament for many Christians. It's so full of practical advice on how to live wisely and well in God's world.
<p> But is Proverbs more than just a large collection of pithy sayings? What is the overall message of the book of Proverbs? And how does understanding Proverbs as a whole help us understand and apply each of the individual sayings?
<p> In this first of two volumes of studies, Joshua Ng answers these questions by giving us an overview of the book of Proverbs, especially in the light of its first nine chapters. In the process, we learn much about the wise and foolish life, about what it means to 'fear' God, and about how the teaching of Proverbs relates to Jesus and the teaching of the whole Bible.
