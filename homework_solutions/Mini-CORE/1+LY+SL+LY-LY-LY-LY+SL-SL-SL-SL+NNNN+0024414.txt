<h> Can't Afford To Do It Lyrics
<p> Well, I wanna go out without tearing my bed, now I'se so scared my baby quit 'n' I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it And loose that girl of mine
<p> Well she spend my money - buying me clothes She's done cheapest woman I ever did know 'n' So, I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it And loose that girl of mine Yeah
<p> Break:
<p> I got a good friend from Alabam He tried to steal my chick I don't know how many time I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it, ah I can't afford to do it And loose that girl of mine, ah
<p> I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it I can't afford to do it And loose that girl of mine, um [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/fleetwood+m\\... ]
