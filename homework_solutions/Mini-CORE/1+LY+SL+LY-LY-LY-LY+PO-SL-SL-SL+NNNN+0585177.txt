<p> C                     F      C As I was going for a walk, G7     C I got as far as half a block. F                        F#dim Trouble with my foot, ooh, C                       A There's something in my shoe, D7 So I took it off and shook it, G7         F#7      G7      G+ Look it! Look it! Look it!
<p> I went home and stood on the kitchen floor. I didn't think I would have any more Trouble with my foot, ooh, There was something in my shoe, So I took it off and shook it, Look it! Look it! Look it! You know what fell out?
