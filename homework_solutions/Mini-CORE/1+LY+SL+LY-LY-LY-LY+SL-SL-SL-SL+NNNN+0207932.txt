<h> If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out Lyrics - Cat Stevens
<p> Well, if you want to sing out, sing out And if you want to be free, be free 'Cause there's a million things to be You know that there are
<p> And if you want to live high, live high And if you want to live low, live low 'Cause there's a million ways to go You know that there are
<p> [Chorus:] You can do what you want The opportunity's on And if you can find a new way You can do it today You can make it all true And you can make it undo you see ah ah ah its easy ah ah ah You only need to know
<p> Well if you want to say yes, say yes And if you want to say no, say no 'Cause there's a million ways to go You know that there are
<p> And if you want to be me, be me And if you want to be you, be you 'Cause there's a million things to do You know that there are
<p> [Chorus]
<p> Well, if you want to sing out, sing out And if you want to be free, be free 'Cause there's a million things to be You know that there are You know that there are You know that there are You know that there are You know that there are
<p> my english teacher recently made us watch harold and maude and at first i thought it was going to be a boring movie that had no point. i didnt get too interested in the beginning but once i really knew what the movie was saying i fell in love with it. i love the song also, its beautiful. and the movie changes my perspective on life because recently its been bad but i wanna say that thanks to this song and movie i've been better.
<p> It changes my point of view | Reviewer: Jaime | 10/14/09
<p> The first time I watched Harold and Maude when I was 20 y.o. it captured me forever. Now 20 years after it changes my point of view about life even more. Cat Stevens' music in that movie and specifically this songs was absolutely brilliant, perfect in any senses. I'm starting to discover his work, I'm thrilled!!
<p> This song is a catalyst for great change. We as one world will sing this together all of us :) | Reviewer: Constance | 5/13/09
<p> Beautiful. Perfect. We as humankind might one day sing this song together, each and everyone of us,in real time through satellite hook-up and our world and our planet can know true liberation. And I am betting Oprah is going to have something to with it; as am I. Love to all, Constance Merwin Warner (San Marcos, California) We are all together in beautiful spirit.
<p> great song | Reviewer: Anonymous | 3/17/08
<p> I like the version they sing in the movie Charlie Bartlett, especially at the end. It's slower and more modern, really poignant. One of my favorite movies, and the song really ties into the theme. Watch it.
<p> Choice song | Reviewer: Rex | 1/28/08
<p> This is such a wolf in sheep's clothing song. It starts like a children's nursey school song and turns out to be about existentialism. A work of such simplicity and genius - it could change your life.
<p> beautiful song. | Reviewer: Anonymous | 1/8/08
<p> i just heard this song for the first time a week ago, and I cannot get it out of my head. it's awesome! So beautiful. Everyone should hear it and change! &lt;33

<p> I love this song. And the film it comes from 'Harold and Maude' if you like this song and haven't seen the film I strongly reccomend it. It's perfect for the film!
