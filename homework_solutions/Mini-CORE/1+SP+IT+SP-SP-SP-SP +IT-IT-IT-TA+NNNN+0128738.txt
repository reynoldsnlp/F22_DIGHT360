<p> It was eventful day at City Hall, where a council meeting stretched into its third day. Among the important matters discussed was a master agreement that will allow the city's four new LRT lines to go ahead.
<p> Councillors also voted to defer integrity commissioner complaints against Rob and Doug Ford pending the resolution of the conflict of interest case against the mayor.
<p> But away from City Hall there was real drama. Mayor Ford ducked out mid-meeting to coach his high school football team, the Don Bosco Eagles, in a game against Father Henry Carr Catholic Secondary School. Reportedly, a brawl broke out. Police were on the scene. Eventually, the players left on a TTC bus reportedly ordered by the police.
<p> When Ford returned later in the afternoon, reporters scrummed him about his latest absence. Despite the controversy his extra-curricular has generated, and pleas from his closest allies to keep his focus on his official duties, the mayor was defiant.
<p> Reporter: Why did you decide again to miss a few hours of the council meeting for a football game?
<p> Ford: It was a semi-final football game. It's the playoffs. We're undefeated, we're number two in the city. We're in the championship game. From there, what are we going to do, just forfeit the game?
<p> These kids live - this is their education that rides on these games.
<p> Reporter: Why would the game not have been able to go ahead without you there?
<p> Ford: You can't. You can't (laughs). So you don't have a head coach, you're going to play a game? And it wasn't even on our field? It was on their field? C'mon.
<p> Reporter: There aren't other assistant coaches who could fill in?
<p> Ford: No, they can't be a head coach. It's impossible.
<p> Reporter: So the game would have been forfeited if you had been there?
<p> Ford: You don't take any exception. If I get hit by a car, obviously someone would have to do it. But as a head coach, it's the irresponsible thing to do. And if I wasn't there, things would have gotten out of hand. I think you should talk to the police about that.
<p> Reporter: But shouldn't you be here? It's a council meeting, you're the mayor of Toronto.
<p> Ford: I was here, you're absolutely right. I made a commitment. I'm not a quitter. I made a commitment and I commit to things. Maybe you guys have a different way of doing things, but I don't.
<p> Reporter: But when you're coaching responsibilities and your mayoral...
<p> Ford: My coaching responsibilities, I've said this from day one. I've made a commitment, I've done it for 20 years, and I'm not changing.
