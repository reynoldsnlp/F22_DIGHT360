<h> It Had to Be You Lyrics
<p> Artist: Ray Charles Album: The Genius of Ray Charles [Atlantic]
<p> It had to be you. It had to be you. I've wandered around, finally found somebody who, could make me be true. Whoa whoa whoa could make me be blue. And, even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you...
<p> Some others I've seen - might never be mean. Might never be cross. Or, try to be boss. But, they wouldn't do. For nobody else gave me a thrill. With all your faults I love you still. It had to be you. Wonderful you. It had to be you...
<p> &lt;Piano Solo&gt;
<p> 'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill. With all yo' faults - I love you still now. And it had to be you. It just had to be you. It had to be you...

<p> by Darlene hampton on 8/13/2012 8:24am I read the new york times bestselling fifth shades so, when the movie comes out I hope this song is recognize in the movie as it is in the book because the lyric in the song is what christian grey saw in anastasia steel. Love the books can not wait for the movie.
