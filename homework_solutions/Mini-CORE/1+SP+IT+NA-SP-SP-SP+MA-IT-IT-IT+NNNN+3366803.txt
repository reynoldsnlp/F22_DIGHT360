<p> One of my favorite parts of this job is being introduced to new artists and bands. This was the case when I was first approached to speak with C2C, a DJ group from France. It's not normally my genre of music but as I researched and listened to the band I found myself really enjoying their sound.
<p> While the group is not incredibly well known in North America(yet), they have made a very impressive name for themselves in Europe. Having won the DMC World Competition four years in a row these musicians are no strangers to putting on incredible live shows.
<p> Their new album "Tetra" was released in Canada just this past Tuesday and we're keeping our fingers crossed that the group will be bringing their music to Quebec and Canada very shortly.
<p> Below you can read my phone interview with DJ Greem:
<p> CONFRONT: How was your show tonight?
<p> C2C: Tonight? It was great! It was quite a big venue for this city and the crowd was really cool for a Tuesday night.
<p> CONFRONT: Can you give me a brief history of the group? How did you guys come together?
<p> C2C: We met in high school so we've been friends since before we started making music together. First of all there was Hocus Pocus, a hip hop band, and 20Syl, a member of C2C, was the singer of the band. I met him in high school and I began to scratch and make music with the turntables. Then Atom joined us and then Pfel a bit later. In 1998 we created the group called C2C and we have started to create music as a band.
<p> CONFRONT: Is there a particular reason you decided to use turntables as instruments? Did you learn at a younger age or did it just interest you?
<p> C2C: We fell in love with this instrument. At the beginning it's really something that you use to play music and we take a turntable and really compose and create music. At the end of the 90's it was quite original and we had the feeling that we were discovering an instrument not like guitar which has its history and you can take lessons. When it comes to scratching and discovering the turntables; we felt like we were really creating a new type of music. We were inventing scratch names and stuff like that. It was very fun and exciting.
<p> CONFRONT: How would you describe your sound?
<p> C2C: The style of our music?
<p> CONFRONT: If someone had never heard your music before, how would you describe it to them?
<p> C2C: To describe C2C, first of all we always say we are a band and we use our turntables like instruments. The C2C style is really about creating a shock in cultures between the past and the present and between some countries. We mix some cultural music. For example as down the road when you listen to our album it's a mix between an old school music blues and a more electro-hip hop with fat beats and basses. The band is all about mixing different cultures.
<p> CONFRONT: I saw that you were number one at the DMC World Championship for four years in a row. That's incredible. What was that experience like for you?
<p> C2C: It's a really big part of our history. It's thanks to DMC that we became a little famous. I say a little bit because the world of DJ's is not like when you win the World Cup playing soccer or anything like that. It's really different. The DMC pushed us to compete and to create each year a different show and to show our music. We were not really in the competition and showing technical stuff but more in doing music and showing the people that it can be an instrument and something musical that you can dance to. Now most of the time at shows and things like that they will write "four times in a row world champions" and people will ask about it and talk about it. It's really incredible exposure.
<p> CONFRONT: If someone were to come see your group for the first time, how would you describe C2C's live show?
<p> C2C: It's really a big show. It's like the DMC competitions but 2.0 because we have this experience to make a show with choreography and lots of moves with dynamic. We don't stay stuck behind the turntables. Now we have videos on screen and we are scratching sounds as well as visuals. We have sound engineers. Our shows are more professional and impressive. We have a lot of tricks in the show. When you spend an hour watching us it's progressive and you can see the evolution because the screens are moving and there are a lot of surprises. I would describe the show but not tell all the tricks because I think its part of the surprise.
<p> CONFRONT: Your album "Tetra" has been released in France but not North America correct?
<p> C2C: Right! It's been released in France in September.
<p> CONFRONT: What's the reception been like in France so far?
<p> C2C: Very well in France. We were very surprised by the welcoming of the people. It's been #1 for months in digital sales on iTunes. All the venues and concerts we do are sold out. It's really a big success. We were not expecting this but it's cool.
<p> CONFRONT: Do you have any plans to come to Canada or anywhere in North America?
<p> C2C: We hope so!  I hope we're going to come to Canada and tour in Quebec and all the other parts of Canada. It would be great. The album will be released in Canada and we'll come. The major difficulty is that we have a big set up and it's hard to travel with all of it.
<p> CONFRONT: Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with the magazine! I know it's late in France right now.
