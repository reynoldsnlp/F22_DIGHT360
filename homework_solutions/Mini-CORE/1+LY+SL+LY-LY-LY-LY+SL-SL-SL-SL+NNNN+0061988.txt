<h> I'm Glad I Got To See You Once Again Lyrics - Hank Snow
<p> I'm glad I got to see you once again Although we're through I still love you I guess I'll have to call you just a friend Cause someone new has just stepped in
<p> I try to say that I don't really miss you But in my heart I know it's just a lie And if someday his love should prove untrue I'll be around when he has said goodbye [ guitar ] (I try to say that I don't really miss you) But in my heart I know it's just a lie And if someday his love should prove untrue I'll be around when he has said goodbye (Goodbye)
