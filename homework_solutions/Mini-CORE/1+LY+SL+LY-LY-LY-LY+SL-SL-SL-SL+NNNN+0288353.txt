<p> Seems like we're holding on forever. I gotta let it go. Times up, you pushed me to surrender tonight. Who knows what happens now whatever, where ever the wind blows. And I'm there as long as we're together, alright...
<p> Let's have the time of our lives like there's no one else around. Just throw your hands up high even when they try to take us down. We'll have the time of our lives 'til the lights burn out, let's laugh until we cry. Life is only what you make it now, let's have the time of our lives.
<p> Dreamers don't care if it's right. I think I'm really into you. Restless let's leave it all behind and tonight. Crazy when you cross my mind, all the trouble we could get into. So what, let's just give this a try, alright... ( From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/m/miley-cyru\\... )

<p> Lookin' back, what are we waitin' for? Take the chance, now's all we've got for sure.
