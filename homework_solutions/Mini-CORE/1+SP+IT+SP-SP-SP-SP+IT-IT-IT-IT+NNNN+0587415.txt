<h> Hell is empty and all the devils are here
<p> Bethany McLean, the former Fortune journalist who exposed Enron's corrupt business practices, talks to Financial News about bankers, 'how bright people can do some pretty stupid things' and her new book on the hidden history of the financial crisis.
<p> The book, by authors Joe Nocera and Bethany McLean, who also co-wrote The Smartest Guys in the Room, is a painstaking exploration of the events that led up to the downturn and the individuals involved. |
<p> Financial News met up with McLean, now a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and asked who she believed was most to blame for the financial crisis and whether any lessons were learnt from Enron.
<p> ---
<p> FN: Your book starts around 30 years ago with Lewis Ranieri and covers each of the main institutions and firms involved in the financial crisis from the regulators to the politicians. Do you think everyone was equally to blame?
<p> BM: I think it's really hard to apportion blame. But I if I had to I would say: politicians and regulators, because it was their job to protect people and protect the system and they failed. Bankers were doing what bankers do; mortgage originators were doing what mortgage originators do. I guess the other group is the rating agencies and that's because they too had an explicit job. It wasn't to make investment banks happy, it wasn't to grow their bottom lines, it was to rate bonds and they failed abysmally. And they did so through some level of self-delusion which we all fell victim to but also a fair degree of venality.
<p> FN It seems that all the key players in your book suffered from that same problem.
<p> BM: That's true. Someone said the problem with the crisis is that it's really hard to find the line between self-delusion, venality and corruption. It's what makes the crisis this complicated story of human nature. And that's what makes the narrative somewhat unsatisfying because we all want to have someone that we can parade in front of TV cameras and say here's why it all went sour. But it's more complicated than that and it's an explanation for why there haven't been many criminal prosecutions in the wake of the crisis.
<p> FN: Human nature was one of the themes of your book and each of the head of the major firms and institutions you write about seem to have a fatal flaw. What would you say these were?
<p> BM: The classic human fatal flaws: greed, arrogance and self-delusion. People want to focus on the money and say people were doing it for the money but it's not that simple. People were also doing it for their egos.
<p> FN: But your book shows profits were a hugely motivating factor.
<p> BM: The analyst in me likes the idea that competition would lead to a better outcome but when you look at the crisis competition frequently led to a race to the bottom. I don't know why the theory is so different to the reality. It happened with the rating agencies, it happened in subprime lending where Angelo Mozilo's fatal flaw was ambition. He wanted his company to be number one and because the sleazy subprime lender down the road was making a loan, Countrywide did it too.
<p> FN: What qualities do you think the next generation of leaders need to make sure they don't make the same mistakes?
<p> BM: I think you can learn from the lessons from the past which is why books about the crisis are important. We used the words "devils" but we don't mean these are terrible people who set out to do bad things. Some people who are idealistic like Mozilo can end up doing very dangerous things. That's a lesson for any leader to take to heart. Choices of right or wrong are not presented to you in black and white. If they were I'm sure most people would choose white. Another thing I think is to always be open to sceptics who are pointing out what the flaw in the system is
<p> FN: How culpable were the public?
<p> BM: I still struggle with this to some extent. When I started the book I would've said that most of the blame belonged to the public because I believe in personal responsibility. But one of the revelations was the extent to which people were sold loans rather than sought them out. A couple of telling moments was when we found these internal Washington Mutual documents showing how they tried to convince people who wanted 30-year mortgages to take out option ARMS because they could sell those to Wall Street for more money. Another was that everybody knew Wall Street bought the loans once they were made but what I didn't know was the role that Wall Street played in setting the terms of the mortgages that were available.
<p> FN: What would you say surprised you the most while you were researching the book?
<p> BM: That was one. The second was that the crisis wasn't really about home ownership. Home ownership was a fig leaf to mask all sorts of terrible practices and what the crisis was really about was credit. And most subprime lending didn't start out of a desire to put people into homes, it was about cash up refinancing, it was about allowing people to keep up with the consumer class and allowing them to use their homes as an ATM machine by loading up them up with debt. Everybody knew this and looked the other way. And that to me is the real scandal. I remember driving around at the start of the financial crisis and seeing these banners saying "Let your home take you on vacation". Everybody pretended and still pretends it was giving people a chance at home ownership. It never was.
<p> FN: Vanity Fair published an excerpt from a chapter from your book called "Goldman Envy" which looked at Merrill Lynch's downfall. One of the main characters in the chapter is Osman Semerci who has since disclaimed the information. Has he filed a lawsuit?
<p> BM: I'll caveat by saying that the Merrill reporting was my co-author's. But as far as I know no lawsuit has been filed yet. His lawyers have made threatening noises. The reporting is really solid.
<p> FN: You wrote the Enron book. Does the financial crisis make you think there were no lessons learned?
<p> BM: I do. The worst story I ever wrote was after the conviction of Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay. My co-author and I wrote a piece for Fortune saying everything's going to be different now. From off-balance sheet accounting and structured investment vehicles that ended up really serving as a transmitter of the virus, there was no change. The credit rating agencies were there unchanged and unreformed when this crisis started to brew.
<p> FN: Based on the fact that there was no change after Enron, how much hope do you have for the regulatory changes that are taking place in the US and in Europe?
<p> BM: I'm not a big believer in the power of more regulation to fix things. I think it can almost be more dangerous because it provides the illusion that things have been fixed without the substance. After Enron, this law called Sarbanes-Oxley that was passed, which turned out absolutely irrelevant in the financial crisis. In the end, regulation comes down to the ability and the will to regulate and you can't mandate either of those things by law.
<p> FN: Throughout your book there is a long list of people [Edward Gramlich, Josh Rosner, Donna Tanoue and Brooksley Born to name a few] who foresaw that some kind of disaster was on the horizon. Why were they ignored?
<p> BM: It speaks to a fundamental imbalance between the voices of consumers and the voices of industry. I think it gets to a deeper issue which is the notion of what is corruption. There's explicit corruption and implicit corruption. I don't think there's a whole lot of explicit corruption. What I mean by implicit corruption is people who think the same way and so you don't need to exchange favours because you already agree with each other and the problem during most of the crisis years is that the regulators and the politicians thought like the industry and so you didn't need bribery.
<p> FN: Do you think it will be back to business-as-usual once we're through the crisis?
<p> BM: I think that what's happening in Europe now is a continuation of the crisis. I'm not sure that people or governments are inclined to change but I think the markets are forcing change. And I think that's going to happen in the US as surely as it's happening in Europe and if it doesn't happen in the US, the market will force it at some point. So I don't think it can continue as it was, not because of the politicians but simply because it can't. So many of these things are grounded in human nature that we can't say we've learned our lesson and we'll never do this again. We may never do this again, but we'll do some variation of this.
<p> FN: Bloomberg said your grand conclusion is that "bright people can do some pretty stupid things". Do you think that's accurate?
<p> BM: I do. I'd like to think there was a bit more to it than that but I've come to use the line that you just can't underestimate the amount of incompetence in the world. My favourite line in the book is a Merrill Lynch risk manager saying "We fell for our own scam."
