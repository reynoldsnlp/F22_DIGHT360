<h> Ryan Leslie - How It Was Supposed To Be Lyrics
<h> How It Was Supposed To Be
<p> Fresh like the kiss of morning dew That's how It felt that day we met and I 1st laid eyes on u..(yeaahhhhh) It's like you walked right about my fantasy And then you left that day Girl why did u abandon me Baby you'll see when you
<p> And I wonder if you'll ever find out how it was supposed to beeeee Babyyy(2x)
<p> [How It Was Supposed To Be Lyrics On http://www.elyricsworld.com/ ]
<p> Now when I thnk back the days you were mine Oo how I wish I can flip a switch to turn back the hands of time Ooo Babyyy You were the one that made me real Now that ur gone tell me what in the world am I suppose to feel. Without you here W/ me
<p> Chorus 2x
<p> Listen Something tells me I've been wrongggg Of the love I felt that u should have given Never thought u would leave me on my own But I see that it's over and I hope one day your mine
