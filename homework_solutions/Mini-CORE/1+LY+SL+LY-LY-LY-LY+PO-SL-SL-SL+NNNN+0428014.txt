<p> Born in the very same year Alive at a similar time It gave me something small that I could feel That maybe as you grew you knew how I'd feel And Caroline & I knew how you'd feel Rattled through our teenage years Battled and loved who we fought The first time you left home on your own I knew A little bit of you is gone when you do And Caroline & I well we grew, well that's true Caroline & I
<p> Poison In The Walls
<p> Back and forward, eyes on the prize Powder burns and lies Medusa on the strings And though you?re fading fast You thought you?d made it past The guards and the dogs Circuit lines and cogs Machines that make you wings Don?t run on dirty oil You?re getting stale But sometimes you see those eyes in the sky There?s poison in the walls The revolution never called And now we?re all the same For so long deep down and blue There?s nothing more that?s new And where?s that brilliant juice The flame that fired your heart That made you want to start Oh, oh let?s go And on with the show The snake?s up in the roof Then the click of hoof It?s time to fly But sometimes you see those eyes in the sky There?s poison in the walls The revolution never called So don?t go outside like a child in the streets Hanging on by claws Another useless empty cause And now we?re all the same Skin And though you?re fading fast Your dreamings? free But sometimes you see those eyes in the sky There?s poison in the walls The revolution never called So don?t go outside like a child in the streets Hanging on by claws Another useless empty cause And now we?re all the same Skin
<p> Mrs. Morgan
<p> Mrs. Morgan?s neighbours have finally had enough ?cause she?s been telling fortunes and now she?s called their bluff ?cause no one likes their secrets walking ?round the town and everyone?s defeated as the light just shivers down she never wanted to see the rain it?s an easy greasy Sunday the dew?s still on the lawn a plane is writing letters ?people you?ve been warned? and the neighbourhood is praying now their secret?s been revealed and Mrs. M keeps saying there?s one thing you can?t steal she never wanted to see the rain but sometimes it crumbles like sand through your hands and sometimes it cracks and cracks she never wanted to see the rain
<p> In Her Diary
<p> In her diary are photographs of some people she's known Stuck with tape to the page and written beneath are words For these people she's known these people she's known written in ink simple words the kind you find sometime written in stone written in stone In her diary are chapters of a book she wrote The time and place the recent past but she can't seem to find how those people spoke or told jokes She tries to unlock and all that she's got is some kind of thing that reminds her of a photograph of some people she's known Stuck with tape to the page and written beneath are words In her diary
<p> Too Much Of One Thing
<p> Nothing in my life is numbered In my life nothing is planned You might think you see purpose When what you're seeing is a band A thin line like from a spider Upon which I dance Nothing in these days is constant Come home to chance In the distance Is a bridge And on the bridge a rail I have known a hundred women And part of me loves to fail But then again I have broken The expectations of a King And through the mist and the armour Too Much Of One Thing Some rise in the morning Their milk upon the sill The last time I saw sunrise It had a dream to kill Breath low my scented lover Bottles and vials, potions and pills I could carve you from memory Then carry you through these hills Behind my back is a curtain In my eyes there is love Two sides to this story The great divide makes it tough There are those that despise me Lead me round on a ring But I've always been a target Too Much Of One Thing When I rise in the morning It's as if I've walked a hundred miles What I once did so easy Now comes in a hundred styles Hundred styles in a magazine The same summer to spring What I need is persistence Too Much Of One Thing
<p> Crooked Lines
<p> Underneath the lightfields Near a wall of water You can put your head down here Forget all you fought for Gotta learn to give Gotta learn to live Crooked lines See the day reappearing Bright light like butter You can say we?re faking Athens or Sparta Gotta learn to give Gotta learn to live Gotta learn to breathe Gotta learn to leave Crooked lines
<p> Old Mexico
<p> Somebody somewhere is stealing time Take a trip to Old Mexico Where you can unwind No need to say you?re sorry No need to beg Just try the perfect stranger in your head You were so excited But you weren?t invited You were so excited Turn the lights off, you?ll be blinded Hang out with lotus people Down at the beach Daydreams and brilliant colours They?re in your reach No need to say you?re sorry No need to beg Just try the perfect stranger in your head You were so excited But you weren?t invited You were so excited Turn the lights off, you?ll be blinded No need to say you?re sorry No need to beg Just try the perfect stranger in your head No need to pray for glory No need to bleed Just try another story is what you need You were so excited but you weren?t invited
<p> Make Her Day
<p> She's got eyes that really know how to sting She's got fins that reach and touch everything All that glitters gold that paves her way And I just came down here try to make her day She's got a place in history that's what I think When they write that book they'll doublethink All the dust will have to get blown away And I just came down here try to make her day I came down all this way and this is what I say
<p> Something For Myself
<p> Trapped within an image unable to move Want to get out of Folk and get into Rare Groove Want to go to Brazil and see how the people move, in that town Want some _expression need to get a new length It might sound flitty need to get a new strength Go to a new country where you don't know it's length, think I'll go Raised in the Depression suspicious of what is new Told not to pick at society's glue Think I'll sniff it That's what I'll do, for myself
<p> Unfinished Business
<p> When you miss your baby You need some heaven That?s what I heard Unfinished business Are you gonna make it? You?re tired and bit frost Tattoos and snapshots Then lose your way Unfinished business Are you gonna make it?
