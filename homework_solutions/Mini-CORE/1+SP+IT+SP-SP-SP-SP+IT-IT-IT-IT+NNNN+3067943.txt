<p> Japanese artist Cuushe just dropped a new EP, the sweeping and hypnotic Girl You Know That I am Here But The Dream , and it's a stunning venture into ethereal escapism and electronic bliss. Just look at those queuing up to remix the tracks -- Teen Daze, Julia Holter and Motion Sickness Of Time Travel -- to name a few. We caught up with Cuushe to get the lowdown on when, where and how.
<p> Bowlegs: You started making music alone back in 2003 -- what bands were inspiring you at that point in time? I know you've mentioned Boards of Canada in the past -- have they been a direct influence on the Cuushe sound?
<p> Cuushe: I was in a band, but it was more like a copy band, like Herbie Hancock. I started making music by myself from 2008. I like to use fuzzy synth sounds. I think it is inspired by the sounds of BOC.
<p> Bowlegs: It has been 3 years since your debut album -- what have you been up to in that time? Has it been a positive period of your life in a musical sense despite the lack of output?
<p> Cuushe: I'm not not a prolific music maker, I'm not able to create lots of new songs in a short period of time. During the 3 years between now and my current EP, I spent much of this time recording the tracks you can hear on Girl You Know That I am Here But the Dream . I know it was too long between release, so I hope to make a new album as soon as possible.
<p> Bowlegs: So what is the fascination with sleep on the new EP? I sense you see it as a form of escape, the only place where people can't reach you perhaps?
<p> Cuushe: Yes. Sleep is like...an escape from reality, be free, protected by something, like a baby....for me
<p> Bowlegs: This EP has such an ethereal soul -- the songs and sounds seem to float effortlessly forward. I adore the track I Dreamt About Silence . Where were you when you wrote that song -- and how does a Cusshe song start its life?
<p> Cuushe: Thank you! I am really happy to hear it. I was in my room when I started to make I Dreamt About Silence . It was September. I created the basic for the track.... but I stopped making the song since I wasn't sure it was right. But later, in winter time, I revisited it and decided to continue making the song.
<p> Bowlegs: There is an impressive array of artists remixing these songs -- how do they get involved, and is it an enlightening hearing your tracks being re-interpreted? Tell us one of your personal favourites from this selection?
<p> Cuushe: My label owner (Yasuhiko) introduced me some of the artists, and I really liked them, so we contact them directly. We sent them some songs and allowed the artist to choose 1 song. It worked really well, and I really like every remix!:) I want to say a special thank you to Motion Sickness of Time Travel for her great remix and artwork!
<p> Bowlegs: Do you think growing up in Japan has directly influenced the music you play? Was there a group of you all discovering electronic music at the same time? What was the first piece of musical equipment you owned?
<p> Cuushe: Yes. Growing up in Japan has been a massive influence. I think Japanese pop is very unique and has its own subculture. We have YMO... and many other wonderful electronic musicians! My first instrument I played was the piano that my mother gave me when I was 5.
<p> Bowlegs: With the EP getting such a great response do you feel that you want to explore these dreamscapes of pop further? Is there an album in the works?
<p> Cuushe: Yes I am making an album with dreamscapes of pop!
<p> Bowlegs: Finally tell us what albums released this year have been on your radar?
