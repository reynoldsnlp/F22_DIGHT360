<p> It's not for me to say you love me It's not for me to say you'll always care Oh, but here for the moment I can hold you fast And press your lips to mine And dream that love will last As far as I can see this is heaven And speaking just for me It's ours to share [- From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/b/billie-hol\\... -] Perhaps the glow of love will grow With every passing day Or we may never meet again But then, it's not for me to say
<p> And speaking just for me It's ours to share Perhaps the glow of love will grow With every passing day Or we may never meet again But then, it's not for me to say
