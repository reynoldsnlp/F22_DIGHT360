<p> Ferraro grew up in New York City and became a teacher and lawyer. She joined the Queens County District Attorney's Office in 1974, where she headed the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence. She was elected to the House in 1978, where she rose rapidly in the party hierarchy while focusing on legislation to bring equity for women in the areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans. In 1984, former vice president and presidential candidate Walter Mondale selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election . In doing so she became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee in addition to being the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined faded as questions about her and her husband's finances arose. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush .
<p> Ferraro was born in Newburgh, New York , [ 1 ] the daughter of Antonetta L. Ferraro (ne Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Campania ) and owner of two restaurants. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. [ 4 ] Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary's in Newburgh when she was young. [ 6 ] Her father died of a heart attack in May 1944 , when she was eight. [ 7 ] Ferraro's mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family's money, forcing the family to move to a low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro's mother worked in the garment industry to support them. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 8 ]
<p> Ferraro stayed on at Mount Saint Mary's as a boarder for a while, then briefly attended a parochial school in the South Bronx. [ 9 ] Beginning in 1947, she attended and lived at the parochial Marymount Academy in Tarrytown, New York , using income from a family rental property in Italy and skipping seventh grade. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] At Marymount Ferraro was a member of the honor society , active in several clubs and sports, voted most likely to succeed, [ 4 ] and graduated in 1952. [ 11 ] Her mother was adamant that she get a full education, [ 12 ] despite an uncle in the family saying, "Why bother? She's pretty. She's a girl. She'll get married." [ 13 ] Ferraro attended Marymount Manhattan College with a scholarship [ 4 ] while sometimes holding two or three jobs at the same time. [ 14 ] During her senior year she began dating John Zaccaro of Forest Hills, Queens , who had graduated from Iona College with a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps . [ 15 ] Ferraro received a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1956; [ 8 ] she was the first woman in her family to gain a college degree. [ 15 ] She also passed the city exam to become a licensed school teacher. [ 15 ]
<p> Ferraro became engaged to Zaccaro in August 1959 [ 10 ] and married him on July 16 , 1960. [ 19 ] He became a realtor and businessman. [ 8 ] She kept her birth name professionally, as a way to honor her mother for having supported the family after her father's death, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] but used his name in parts of her private life. [ 20 ] The couple had three children, Donna (born 1962), John Jr. (born 1964), and Laura (born 1966). [ 19 ] They lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens , and in 1971, added a vacation house in Saltaire on Fire Island . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] They would buy a condominium in Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1983. [ 21 ] [ 23 ]
<p> While raising the children, Ferraro worked part-time as a civil lawyer in her husband's real estate firm for 13years. [ 17 ] She also occasionally worked for other clients and did some pro bono work for women in family court . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] She spent time at local Democratic clubs, which allowed her to maintain contacts within the legal profession and become involved in local politics and campaigns. [ 24 ] While organizing community opposition to a proposed building, Ferraro met lawyer and Democratic figure Mario Cuomo , who became a political mentor. [ 26 ] In 1970, she was elected president of the Queens County Women's Bar Association. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
<p> Ferraro's first full-time political job came in January 1974 , when she was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York , [ 29 ] by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. [ 17 ] At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon. [ 17 ] Grumblings that she was the beneficiary of nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in the Investigations Bureau. [ 17 ] The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. [ 17 ] [ 29 ] She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. [ 17 ] In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children. [ 29 ] She was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court Bar in 1978. [ 28 ]
<p> As part of the D.A. office, Ferraro worked long hours, and gained a reputation for being a tough prosecutor but fair in plea negotiations . [ 17 ] Although her unit was supposed to turn cases over for court handling, she conducted some trials herself, and juries were persuaded by the summations she gave. [ 17 ] Ferraro was upset to discover that her superior was paying her less than equivalent male colleagues because she was a married woman and already had a husband. [ 24 ] Moreover, Ferraro found the nature of the cases she dealt with debilitating; [ 1 ] the work left her "drained and angry" and she developed an ulcer . [ 30 ] She grew frustrated that she was unable to deal with root causes, and talked about running for legislative office; [ 17 ] Cuomo, now Secretary of State of New York , suggested the United States Congress . [ 31 ]
<p> Ferraro ran for election to the U.S. House of Representatives from New York's 9th Congressional District in Queens in 1978, after longtime Democratic incumbent James Delaney announced his retirement. [ 32 ] The location for the television series All in the Family , the district, which stretched from Astoria to Ozone Park was known for its ethnic composition and conservative views. [ 1 ] In a three-candidate primary race for the Democratic nomination, Ferraro faced two better-known rivals, the party organization candidate, City Councilman Thomas J. Manton and Patrick Deignan. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Her main issues were law and order, support for the elderly, and neighborhood preservation. [ 24 ] She labeled herself a "'small c' conservative" [ 1 ] and emphasized that she was not a bleeding-heart liberal; her campaign slogan was "Finally, A Tough Democrat". [ 35 ] Her Italian heritage also appealed to ethnic residents in the district. [ 24 ] She won the three-way primary with 53percent of the vote, and then captured the general election as well, defeating Republican Alfred A. DelliBovi by a 10-percentage-point margin in a contest in which dealing with crime was the major issue and personal attacks by DelliBovi were frequent. [ 24 ] [ 32 ] She had been aided by $130,000 in campaign loans and donations from her own family, including $110,000 in loans from Zaccaro, of which only $4,000 was legal. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The source and nature of these transactions were declared illegal by the Federal Election Commission shortly before the primary, causing Ferraro to pay back the loans in October 1978 , via several real estate transactions. [ 36 ] In 1979, the campaign and Zaccaro paid $750 in fines for civil violations of election law. [ 36 ]
<p> Ferraro and her family lived in this house in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens , during her time in the House, her vice-presidential campaign, and until the early 2000s.
<p> Ferraro was active in Democratic presidential politics as well. She served as one of the deputy chairs for the 1980 Carter-Mondale campaign . [ 13 ] [ 38 ] Following the election, she served actively on the Hunt Commission that in 1982, rewrote the Democratic delegate selection rules; Ferraro was credited as having been the prime agent behind the creation of superdelegates . [ 38 ] By 1983, she was regarded as one of the up-and-coming stars of the party. [ 13 ] [ 37 ] She was the Chairwoman of the Platform Committee for the 1984 Democratic National Convention , the first woman to hold that position. [ 8 ] There she held multiple hearings around the country and further gained in visibility. [ 1 ]
<p> While in Congress, Ferraro focused much of her legislative attention on equity for women in the areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans. [ 29 ] She was a cosponsor of the 1981 Economic Equity Act. [ 29 ] On the House Select Committee on Aging , she concentrated on the problems of elderly women. [ 29 ] In 1984, she championed a pension equity law revision that would improve the benefits of people who left work for long periods and then returned, a typical case for women with families. [ 45 ] The Reagan administration, at first lukewarm to the measure, decided to sign it to gain the benefits of its popular appeal. [ 45 ]
<p> As with many representatives, Ferraro issued regular newsletters to her constituents.
<p> Ferraro also worked on some environmental issues. During 1980, she tried to prevent the federal government from gaining the power to override local laws on hazardous materials transportation, an effort she continued in subsequent years. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In August 1984 , she led passage of a Superfund renewal bill and attacked the Reagan administration's handling of environmental site cleanups. [ 48 ]
<p> Ferraro took a congressional trip to Nicaragua at the start of 1984, where she spoke to the Contras . [ 49 ] She decided that the Reagan Administration 's military interventions there and in El Salvador were counterproductive towards reaching U.S. security goals, and that regional negotiations would be better. [ 49 ]
<p> In all, Ferraro served three two-year terms, being re-elected in 1980 and 1982. [ 11 ] Her vote shares increased to 58percent and then 73percent and much of her funding came from political action committees . [ 24 ] While Ferraro's pro-choice views conflicted with those of many of her constituents as well as the Catholic Church to which she belonged, her positions on other social and foreign policy issues were in alignment with the district. [ 29 ] She broke with her party in favoring an anti- busing amendment to the Constitution. [ 41 ] [ 50 ] She supported deployment of the PershingII missile and the Trident submarine , although she opposed funding for the MX missile , the B-1B bomber , and the Strategic Defense Initiative . [ 50 ]
<p> While in the House, Ferraro's political self-description evolved to "moderate". [ 1 ] In 1982, she said her experiences as assistant district attorney had changed some of her views: "... because no matter how concerned I am about spending, I have seen first hand what poverty can do to people's lives and I just can't, in good conscience, not do something about it." [ 17 ] For her six years in Congress, Ferraro had an average 78percent "Liberal Quotient" from Americans for Democratic Action [ 51 ] and an average 8percent rating from the American Conservative Union . [ 52 ] The AFL-CIO 's Committee on Political Education gave her an average approval rating of 91percent. [ 42 ]
<p> Mondale selected Ferraro to be his Vice-Presidential candidate on July 12 , 1984. She stated, "I am absolutely thrilled." [ 56 ] The Mondale campaign hoped that her selection would change a campaign in which he was well behind; in addition to attracting women, they hoped she could attract ethnic Democrats in the Northeast U.S. who had abandoned their party for Reagan in 1980 . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] In turn, Mondale accepted the risk that came with her inexperience. [ 57 ]
<p> As Ferraro was the first woman to run on a major party national ticket in the U.S., [ 58 ] and the first Italian American, her July 19 nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention was one of the most emotional moments of that gathering, with female delegates appearing joyous and proud at the historic occasion. [ 59 ] In her acceptance speech, Ferraro said, "The daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for vice president in the new land my father came to love." [ 60 ] Convention attendees were in tears during the speech, not just for its significance for women but for all those who had immigrated to America. [ 61 ]
<p> A flyer advertised a post-convention Queens Borough Hall rally, for Ferraro to introduce Mondale to New York City voters.
<p> Ferraro gained immediate, large-scale media attention. [ 62 ] At first, journalists focused on her novelty as a woman and her poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. [ 63 ] Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. [ 62 ] She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief ; the question "Are you tough enough?" was often directed to her. [ 64 ] Ted Koppel questioned her closely about nuclear strategy [ 65 ] and during Meet the Press she was asked, "Do you think that in any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?" [ 66 ]
<p> The choice of Ferraro was viewed as a gamble, and pundits were uncertain whether it would result in a net gain or loss of votes for the Mondale campaign. [ 67 ] While her choice was popular among Democratic activists, polls immediately after the announcement showed that only 22percent of women were excited about Ferraro's selection, versus 18percent who agreed that it was a "bad idea". By a three-to-one margin, voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision rather than his having chosen the best available candidate. [ 68 ] Nonetheless, in the days after the convention Ferraro proved an effective campaigner, with a brash and confident style that forcefully criticized the Reagan administration and sometimes almost overshadowed Mondale. [ 35 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Mondale had been 16points behind Reagan in polls before the pick, and after the convention he pulled even for a short time. [ 56 ]
<p> By the last week of July, however, questions-due initially to reporting by The New York Times [ 37 ] -began about Ferraro's finances, the finances of her husband, John Zaccaro , and their separately filed tax returns. [ 36 ] (While the Mondale campaign had anticipated some questions, it had only spent 48 hours on vetting Ferraro's family's finances. [ 37 ] [ 69 ] ) This was also the first time the American media had to deal with a national candidate's husband. [ 65 ] Ferraro said she would release both their returns within a month, but maintained she was correct not to have included her husband's financial holdings on her past annual Congressional disclosure statements. [ 36 ] The media also reported on the FEC's past investigation into Ferraro's 1978 campaign funds. [ 36 ] Although Ferraro and Zaccaro's finances were often interwoven on paper, [ 23 ] with each half partners in Zaccaro's company, [ 37 ] Ferraro had little knowledge of his business, or even how much he was worth. [ 70 ] Zaccaro did not understand the greater public exposure that his wife's new position brought to their family, and resisted releasing his financial information. [ 70 ] On August 12 , Ferraro announced that her husband would not in fact be releasing his tax returns, on the grounds that to do so would disadvantage his real estate business and that such a disclosure was voluntary and not part of election law. [ 71 ] She joked, "You people who are married to Italian men, you know what it's like", [ 72 ] angering fellow Italian Americans. [ 31 ]
<p> The announcement dominated television and newspapers; [ 73 ] Ferraro was besieged by questions regarding the finances [ 74 ] as well as criticism for ethnic stereotyping. [ 72 ] As she later wrote, "I had created a monster." [ 72 ] Republicans saw her finances as a "genderless" issue that they could attack Ferraro with without creating a backlash, [ 71 ] and some Mondale staffers thought Ferraro might have to leave the ticket. [ 70 ] The Philadelphia Inquirer went even further in its investigations, seeking to link Zaccaro to organized crime figures, but most publishers avoided this topic and law enforcement officials did not treat the allegations with much seriousness. [ 75 ] A week after her previous statement, Ferraro said Zaccaro had changed his mind and would indeed release his tax records, [ 74 ] which was done on August 20 . [ 76 ] The full statements included notice of payment of some $53,000 in back federal taxes that she owed due to what was described as an accountant's error. [ 76 ] Ferraro said the statements proved overall that she had nothing to hide and that there had been no financial wrongdoing. [ 76 ] The disclosures indicated that Ferraro and her husband were worth nearly $4million, had a full-time maid, and owned a boat and the two vacation homes. [ 31 ] Much of their wealth was tied up in real estate rather than being disposable income, [ 21 ] but the disclosures hurt Ferraro's image as a rags-to-riches story. [ 31 ]
<p> Ferraro's strong performance at an August 22 press conference covering the final disclosure-where she answered all questions for two hours-effectively ended the issue for the remainder of the campaign, but significant damage had been done. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] No campaign issue during the entire 1984 presidential campaign received more media attention than Ferraro's finances. [ 73 ] The exposure diminished Ferraro's rising stardom, removed whatever momentum the Mondale-Ferraro ticket gained out of the convention, and delayed formation of a coherent message for the fall campaign. [ 35 ] [ 59 ] [ 77 ]
<p> Sharp criticism from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro on the defensive during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances with a level of fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy . [ 31 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that "the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor , the Catholic Archbishop of New York , and James Timlin , the Bishop of Scranton , for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion . [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, "the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic" but went on to say that "But I do believe that there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church". [ 82 ] Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a "good Christian" because, she said, his policies hurt the poor. [ 31 ] To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled " A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion ". [ 81 ]
<p> Ferraro drew large crowds on the campaign trail, many of whom wished to see the history-making candidate in person, who often chanted, "Ger-ry! Ger-ry!" [ 86 ] Mondale and Ferraro rarely touched during their appearances together, to the point that he would not even place his palm on her back when they stood side-by-side; Ferraro later said this was because anything more and "people were afraid that it would look like, 'Oh, my God, they're dating.'". [ 87 ]
<p> There was one vice-presidential debate between Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush . Held on October 11 , the result was proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; [ 60 ] [ 88 ] women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush. [ 80 ] At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan's initial refusal to support an extension to the Voting Rights Act . [ 89 ] Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush's experience. [ 89 ] To one Bush statement she said, "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy." [ 60 ] She strongly defended her position on abortion, which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. [ 89 ] In the days leading up to the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as "that four-million-dollar-I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich'." [ 90 ] Barbara Bush soon apologized. [ 90 ] Ferraro's womanhood was consistently discussed during the campaign; one study found that a quarter of newspaper articles written about her contained gendered language. [ 91 ]
<p> On October 18 the New York Post accurately reported that her father had been arrested for possession of numbers slips in Newburgh shortly before his death, and inaccurately speculated that something mysterious had been covered up about that death. [ 92 ] Ferraro's mother had never told her about his arrest; [ 92 ] she had been also arrested as an accomplice but released after her husband's death. [ 31 ] The printing of the story led Ferraro to state that Post publisher Rupert Murdoch "does not have the worth to wipe the dirt under [my mother's] shoes." [ 93 ] Throughout, Ferraro kept campaigning, taking on the traditional running mate role of attacking the opposition vigorously. [ 31 ] By the end, she had traveled more than Mondale and more than Reagan and Bush combined. [ 94 ]
<p> On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro lost the general election in a landslide . They received only 41percent of the popular vote compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia . [ 95 ] Ferraro failed to carry her own congressional district, which always tended to vote Republican in presidential races. [ 96 ] Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. [ 80 ] Reagan captured 55percent of women voters [ 96 ] and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. [ 97 ] Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale-Ferraro, [ 80 ] establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. [ 98 ] Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and " It's morning again in America " were quite strong, [ 99 ] and political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election in 1984. [ 59 ] Mondale himself would later reflect that "I knew that I was in for it with Reagan" and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro. [ 100 ]
<p> After the election, the House Ethics Committee found that Ferraro had technically violated the Ethics in Government Act by failing to report, or reporting incorrectly, details of her family's finances, and that she should have reported her husband's holdings on her Congressional disclosure forms. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] However, the committee concluded that she had acted without "deceptive intent", and since she was leaving Congress anyway, no action against her was taken. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Ferraro said, "I consider myself completely vindicated." [ 102 ] The scrutiny of her husband and his business dealings presaged a trend that women candidates would face in American electoral politics. [ 103 ]
<p> Ferraro had relinquished her House seat to run for the vice-presidency. Her new-found fame led to an appearance in a Diet Pepsi commercial in 1985. [ 3 ] [ 105 ] She published Ferraro: My Story , an account of the campaign with some of her life leading up to it, in November 1985 . It was a best seller and earned her $1million. [ 106 ] She also earned over $300,000 by giving speeches. [ 107 ] She founded the Americans Concerned for Tomorrow political action committee , which focused on getting ten women candidates elected in the 1986 Congressional elections (eight of whom would be successful). [ 108 ] Despite the one-sided national loss in 1984, Ferraro was still viewed as someone with a bright political future. Many expected her to run in the 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato , [ 106 ] and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. [ 109 ] A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in December 1985 , she said she would not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations. [ 106 ]
<p> Members of Ferraro's family were indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had pleaded guilty in January 1985 , to fraudulently obtaining bank financing in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. [ 110 ] Then in October 1986 , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. [ 111 ] A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. [ 112 ] The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense did not have to present its own testimony. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. [ 114 ] Meanwhile, in February 1986 , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. [ 115 ] He was convicted, and in June 1988 , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. [ 115 ] Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. [ 116 ] Asked in September 1987 , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it... I think the candidacy opened a door for women in national politics, and I don't regret that for one minute. I'm proud of that. But I just wish it could have been done in a different way." [ 117 ]
<p> Ferraro remained active in raising money for Democratic candidates nationwide, especially women candidates. [ 108 ] During the 1988 presidential election , Ferraro served as vice chair of the party's Victory Fund. [ 116 ] She also did some commentating for television. [ 116 ] Ferraro was a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics from 1988 to 1992, [ 28 ] teaching in-demand seminars such as "So You Want to be President?" [ 108 ] She also took care of her mother, who suffered from emphysema for several years before her death in early 1990. [ 118 ]
<p> By October 1991, Ferraro was ready to enter elective politics again, and ran for the Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York . [ 119 ] Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams , Reverend Al Sharpton , Congressman Robert J. Mrazek , and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman . Abrams was considered the early front-runner. [ 119 ] The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. [ 120 ] Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. [ 121 ] Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. [ 122 ] She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. [ 122 ] Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. [ 122 ] As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks. [ 107 ] Holtzman ran a negative ad accusing Ferraro and Zaccaro of taking more than $300,000 in rent in the 1980s from a pornographer with purported ties to organized crime. [ 123 ] The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in particular constantly attacked Ferraro's integrity and finances. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about "the ethnic slur that I am somehow or other connected to organized crime. There's lots of innuendo but no proof. However, it is made plausible because of the fact that I am an Italian-American. This tactic comes from the poisoned well of fear and stereotype..." [ 126 ] On the September 15 , 1992, primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than a percentage point, winning 37percent of the vote to 36percent. [ 125 ] Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks. [ 127 ]
<p> Abrams spent much of the remainder of the campaign trying to get Ferraro's endorsement. [ 128 ] Ferraro, enraged and bitter after the nature of the primary, [ 124 ] [ 127 ] ignored Abrams and accepted Bill Clinton 's request to campaign for his presidential bid instead. [ 129 ] She was eventually persuaded by state party leaders into giving an unenthusiastic endorsement with just three days to go before the general election, in exchange for an apology by Abrams for the tone of the primary. [ 128 ] D'Amato won the election by a very narrow margin. [ 124 ] The Ferraro-Holtzman fighting of the campaign was viewed as a disaster by many feminists, [ 130 ] but overall the 1992 U.S. Senate elections saw so many victories that it became known as the " Year of the Woman ".
<p> Following the primary loss, Ferraro became a managing partner in the New York office of Keck, Mahin & Cate , a Chicago-based law firm. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] There she organized the office and spoke with clients, but did not actively practice law and left before the firm fell into difficulties. [ 132 ] Ferraro's second book, a collection of her speeches, was titled Changing History: Women, Power and Politics and was published in 1993. [ 133 ]
<p> In February 1996, Ferraro joined the high-visibility CNN political talk show Crossfire , [ 140 ] as the co-host representing the "from the left" vantage. She kept her brassy, rapid-fire speech and New York accent intact, and her trial experience from her prosecutor days was a good fit for the program's format. [ 141 ] She sparred effectively with "from the right" co-host Pat Buchanan , [ 141 ] for whom she developed a personal liking. [ 142 ] The show stayed strong in ratings for CNN, [ 143 ] and the job was lucrative. [ 105 ] [ 144 ] She welcomed how the role "keeps me visible [and] keeps me extremely well informed on the issues." [ 141 ]
<p> At the start of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire and ran for the Democratic nomination again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York . [ 143 ] The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green . [ 145 ] She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. [ 145 ] Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. [ 105 ] [ 146 ] Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. [ 105 ] However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. [ 147 ] Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. [ 105 ] [ 148 ] In the September 15 , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. [ 105 ] Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. [ 149 ] Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.
<p> The 1998 primary defeat brought an end to Ferraro's political career. The New York Times wrote at the time: "If Ms. Ferraro's rise was meteoric, her political career's denouement was protracted, often agonizing and, at first glance, baffling." [ 105 ] She still retained admirers, though. Anita Perez Ferguson , president of the National Women's Political Caucus , noted that female New York political figures in the past had been reluctant to enter the state's notoriously fierce primary races, and said: "This woman has probably been more of an opinion maker than most people sitting for six terms straight in the House of Representatives or Senate. Her attempts, and even her losses, have accomplished far beyond what others have accomplished by winning." [ 105 ]
<p> Framing a Life: A Family Memoir was published by Ferraro in November 1998 . It depicts the life story of her mother and immigrant grandmother; it also portrays the rest of her family, and is a memoir of her early life, but includes relatively little about her political career. [ 159 ]
<p> Ferraro had felt unusually tired at the end of her second senate campaign. [ 160 ] In November 1998 , she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma , a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. [ 161 ] She did not publicly disclose the illness until June 2001 , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act . [ 161 ] A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. [ 162 ] Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, [ 163 ] and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation . [ 161 ]
<p> Though initially given only three to five years to live, by virtue of several new drug therapies and a bone marrow transplant in 2005, [ 161 ] she would beat the disease's Stage1 survival mean of 62months by over a factor of two. [ 164 ] Her advocacy helped make the new treatments approved and available for others as well. [ 165 ] For much of the last decade of her life, Ferraro was not in remission , but the disease was managed by continually adjusting her treatments. [ 160 ]
<p> In January 2000, Ferraro and Lynn Martin -a former Republican Congresswoman and U.S. Secretary of Labor who had played Ferraro in George H. W. Bush's debate preparations in 1984 [ 169 ] -co-founded, and served as co-presidents of, G&L Strategies, a management consulting firm underneath Weber McGinn. [ 170 ] Its goal was to advise corporations on how to develop more women leaders and make their workplaces more amenable to female employees. [ 169 ] G&L Strategies subsequently became part of Golin Harris International . [ 171 ] In June 2003 , Ferraro was made executive vice president and managing director of the public affairs practice of the Global Consulting Group, [ 171 ] an international investor relations and corporate communications component of Huntsworth . There she worked with corporations, non-profit organizations, state governments and political figures. [ 172 ] She continued there as a senior advisor working about two days a month. [ 161 ]
<p> After living for many years in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens , she and her husband moved to Manhattan in 2002. [ 141 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] She republished Ferraro: My Story in 2004, with a postscript summarizing her life in the twenty years since the campaign. [ 175 ]
<p> Ferraro was a member of the board of directors of Goodrich Petroleum beginning in August 2003 . [ 176 ] She was also a board member for New York Bancorp in the 1990s. [ 144 ]
<p> Ferraro became a principal in the government relations practice of the Blank Rome law firm in February 2007 , working both in New York and Washington [ 172 ] [ 173 ] about two days a week in their lobbying and communications activities. [ 161 ] As she passed the age of 70, she was thankful for still being alive, and said "This is about as retired as I get, which is part time," [ 161 ] and that if she fully retired, she would "go nuts". [ 173 ]
<p> In December 2006, Ferraro announced her support for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton . Later, she vowed to help defend Clinton from being "swiftboated" in a manner akin to 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry . [ 177 ] She assisted with fundraising by assuming an honorary post on the finance committee for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign . [ 178 ] A heated nomination battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama , in which racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates took place. [ 179 ] Ferraro became livid when her daughter voted for Obama in a primary, which reflected a generational difference among American women in how they viewed the significance of a woman being elected president. [ 180 ]
<p> In March 2008 she gave an interview with the Daily Breeze in which she said: "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [ 178 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, [ 31 ] Ferraro said that "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) if you go back to 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [ 178 ] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. [ 183 ] There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama [ 184 ] and Obama called them "patently absurd". [ 179 ] Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. [ 178 ] Again speaking to the Breeze , Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [ 179 ] [ 185 ] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on March 12 , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign. [ 186 ]
<p> Ferraro continued to engage the issue and criticize the Obama campaign via her position as a Fox News Channel contributor. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] By early April, Ferraro said people were deluging her with negative comments and trying to get her removed from one of the boards she was on: "This has been the worst three weeks of my life." [ 189 ] Ferraro stated in mid- May 2008 that Clinton had "raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when I ran". [ 190 ] She thought Obama had behaved in a sexist manner and that she might not vote for him. [ 190 ]
<p> During September 2008, Ferraro gained attention yet again after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] [ 193 ] Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. [ 194 ] In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, "It's great to be the first, but I don't want to be the only. And so now it is wonderful to see a woman on a national ticket." [ 104 ] Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, [ 195 ] but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama's lack of experience in certain areas. [ 191 ] [ 196 ] Ferraro criticized the media's scrutiny of Palin's background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; [ 191 ] [ 197 ] a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. [ 198 ] A Newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro's time to Palin's, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. [ 192 ] In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that "little girls [could] see someone there who can stand toe to toe with [Biden]." [ 193 ] McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that "Every time a woman runs, women win." [ 192 ]
<p> Ferraro continued to battle her cancer, making repeated visits to hospitals during her last year and undergoing difficult procedures. [ 199 ] Much of her care took place at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where she also acted as an informal advocate for other patients. [ 165 ] She was able to make a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News Channel's coverage of the November 2010 midterm elections . [ 200 ]
<p> In March 2011 she went to Massachusetts General Hospital to receive treatment for pain caused by a fracture, a common complication of multiple myeloma. [ 201 ] Once there, however, doctors discovered she had come down with pneumonia. Unable to return to her New York home, Ferraro died at Massachusetts General on March 26 , 2011. [ 201 ] [ 202 ] In addition to her husband and three children, who were all present, she was survived by eight grandchildren. [ 201 ] [ 203 ]
<p> President Obama said upon her death that "Geraldine will forever be remembered as a trailblazer who broke down barriers for women, and Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life," and said that his own two daughters would grow up in a more equal country because of what Ferraro had done. [ 204 ] Mondale called her "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [ 202 ] George H. W. Bush said, "Though we were one-time political opponents, I am happy to say Gerry and I became friends in time - a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, not the least of which was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [ 204 ] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, "She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women." [ 200 ] Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, "Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind - tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in - a New York icon and a true American original." [ 203 ]
<p> During her time in Congress, Ferraro received numerous awards from local organizations in Queens. [ 3 ]
<p> In 2007, Ferraro received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Sons of Italy Foundation . [ 209 ] In 2008, Ferraro was the initial recipient of the annual Trailblazer Award from the National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, [ 210 ] and received the Edith I. Spivack Award from the New York County Lawyers' Association . [ 211 ] In 2009, legislation passed the House of Representatives calling for a post office in Long Island City in Queens to be renamed for Ferraro, [ 212 ] and in 2010, the Geraldine A Ferraro Post Office was accordingly rededicated. [ 44 ]
<p> In the fall of 2013, P.S. 290 in Maspeth in Queens will be renamed the Geraldine A. Ferraro Campus. [ 213 ]
