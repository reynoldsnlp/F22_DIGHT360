<h> Ex-minister backs bailout for Spain
<p> ELEANOR HALL: Chaos has been spreading across Europe over the last 24 hours, with millions of people in several countries taking to the streets to vent their anger over austerity measures.
<p> Hundreds of flights across the continent have been cancelled; car factories and ports are at a standstill; and rail services have been disrupted, as part of a co-ordinated general strike.
<p> More than 70 people have been arrested so far in the protest action in Spain and police have fired rubber bullets at protesters in central Madrid.
<p> But while the Spanish government is imposing salary cuts and tax hikes, so far it's resisted taking out a bailout.
<p> Alejandro Inurrieta is a minister or was a minister in the previous socialist government and he says that is a mistake.
<p> He spoke in Madrid to our Europe correspondent Mary Gearin.
<p> ALEJANDRO INURRIETA: Well, my opinion is that Spain should accept money from the UN and the International Money Fund because we need right now a lot of money to repay our debt, our huge debt especially private debate not public debt. The problem is that because of the policy, European policy especially German policy we are suffering in Spain.
<p> The Spanish society suffering probably the worst crisis, social and economic crisis since probably the finish of the civil war.
<p> MARY GEARIN: So should the Spanish government have accepted a bailout by now?
<p> ALEJANDRO INURRIETA: By now I mean, a long time ago. The reason, political reasons. I mean all the governments in Europe that have been suffering the same thing - there is Portugal, Greece. The government at that time were running the country they are gone so probably it is a political fact.
<p> This government is really fearing that if they do that probably the next step will be new elections and probably they will be gone from the government.
<p> MARY GEARIN: How will Spain turn around the unemployment situation and when do you think that that could start to happen?
<p> ALEJANDRO INURRIETA: We had a huge real estate sector, construction, building houses. Too many houses are built in this country and too many houses are bought in this country. So after the bubble explode, we are now suffering that problem. We don't have another sectors, economy sectors that could increase the activity in order to compliment the huge unemployment rate that we have from that sector.
<p> So we have out of six million we have now 5.8, around three million people come from that sector. So if we don't have another sector that could employ three million people with a lower level of education, obviously we don't have the possibility to employ that people and so we are going to be with a high rate of unemployment from now until probably 10 years.
<p> MARY GEARIN: And what has been the social effect of that on Spain and what will continue to happen socially?
<p> ALEJANDRO INURRIETA: Well socially I think it is a big crisis, big crisis especially in the middle-class. Okay, middle-class is probably destroyed in this country. You are suffering losing rights, losing education rights, medical rights and they are suffering now with the problem the housing, the people aren't able to pay to repay the debt, their house, their mortgage so the people are just expulsing from their houses.
<p> So a lot of people are now turning out to be poor people.
<p> I mean we are going to be a country more or less like probably in the next months or next years, like Greece, Portugal. We are losing around 20, 30 per cent of our GDP per capita.
<p> MARY GEARIN: There have been those mass evictions but in the last few days the political parties have met, the banks have made some concessions. Do you think that they go far enough?
<p> ALEJANDRO INURRIETA: No, I mean I think the political parties now, both the biggest parties in Spain, the Socialist and the other one, the Popular Party, I think they are just really afraid of a big revolution and the bank system also I think they have fear that people could, you know make some actions even violent actions right. So they trying just to gain time.
<p> I mean, I think they are saying well we have two years for pain again or two years to suspend the payments for a while - but they are not trying to fix a new passing policy which is what Spain needs in this time.
<p> MARY GEARIN: Will mass displays of protests and public disaffection, will that change anything?
<p> ALEJANDRO INURRIETA: Er, I hope, I hope so. I hope that all this situation in Europe will make Germany to reconsider their policy. Germany needs that Europe goes up. If Europe goes down, Germany will go down so I hope all this protest, all this situation will change the policy of German government and also the policy of the European Central Bank.
<p> ELEANOR HALL: That is Alejandro Inurrieta, an economic consultant who was a former minister in the Socialist government in Spain, speaking to our European correspondent, Mary Gearin.
