<p> Turn the lights down baby And come to be baby Let me put something on your mind mmmmm-hmmm See I gotta let you know That I want-What I want-Whenever I need it baby So you know, you better be ready tonight 'cause it's on
<p> chorus:
<p> Haven't you heard About my up and down (and round and round) You should've known by now (baby) About the merry-go-round Haven't you heard About my up and down (and round and round) You should've known by now About the merry-go-round
<p> 2nd verse:
<p> You said you be happy With a wife and happy home What I don't understand is why you're here with me (tonight) Cause' if your girlfriend Could do the freaky things I do for you You would have no time to hang around for my up and down
<p> Deep in my heart I know I can make you moan c'mon lets get it on baby All in my mind
<p> break down:
<p> you betta hold on tight 'cause tonight is the night We won't stop 'till we get it all right Hold on tight Tonight is the night Baby you're in for the time of your life yeaaah
<p> Haven't you heard About my up and down (and round and round) You should've known by now (baby) About the merry-go-round Haven't you heard About my up and down (and round and round) You should've known by now About the merry-go-round
<p> *said during last chorus:
<p> (round and round and round we go, where we'll stop, nobody ever knows)
