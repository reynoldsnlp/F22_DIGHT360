<p> The games in the series have been praised as being among the best first-person shooters on a video game console , and are considered the Xbox 's " killer app ". [ 3 ] This has led to the term " Halo killer" being used to describe console games that aspire, or are considered, to be better than Halo . [ 4 ] Fueled by the success of Halo: Combat Evolved , and immense marketing campaigns from publisher Microsoft, its sequels went on to break various sales records. Halo 3 sold more than US$ 170million worth of copies in the first twenty-four hours of release, breaking the record set by Halo 2 three years prior. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Halo: Reach , in turn, broke the record set by Halo 3 , selling US$200million worth of copies on its first day of release. [ 7 ] Continuing the trend, Halo 4 broke Halo: Reach 's record on its opening day by grossing US$220 million. The games have sold over 50million copies worldwide, with the games alone grossing almost $3.4billion. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
<p> The cultural impact of the Halo series has been compared by writer Brian Bendis to that of Star Wars . [ 10 ] The collective group of fans of the series is referred to as the "Halo Nation". [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
<p> In the distant past, an intellectual race called the Forerunners fought an alien parasite known as the Flood . The Flood, which spread through infestation of sentient life, overran much of the Milky Way Galaxy . One of the races affected was humanity, who went into space and came into conflict with the Forerunners. Exhausted by their war and after having explored all other options, the Forerunners conceived a weapon of last resort to combat the Flood. Using an installation known as the Ark, they built large ring-shaped megastructures known as Halos . The Halo Array, when activated, would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy-depriving the Flood of their food, after which samples of the lost lifeforms would be reseeded. Delaying as long as they could, the Forerunners activated the rings and disappeared. [ 12 ] Tens of thousands of years later, in the 26th century, humanity - under the auspices of the United Nations Space Command , or UNSC - colonize many worlds thanks to the development of faster-than-light " slipspace " travel. Tensions escalate between the older and more stable "Inner Colonies" and the remote "Outer Colonies", leading to civil war . The UNSC creates an elite group of enhanced supersoldiers, known as Spartans , to suppress the rebellion covertly. [ 13 ] In the year 2525, the human colony of Harvest falls under attack by a theocratic alliance of alien races known as the Covenant . The Covenant leadership declares humanity heretics and an affront to their gods-the Forerunners-and begins a holy war of genocide. The Covenant's superior technology and numbers prove decisive advantages; though effective, the Spartans are too few in number to turn the tide of battle in humanity's favor.
<p> In 2552, the Covenant arrive at Reach, the UNSC's last major stronghold beyond Earth, and launch an invasion of the planet. The last Spartans and UNSC military are unable to stop the Covenant from bombarding the surface with plasma. Following directives to avoid leading the Covenant to Earth, Cortana , the AI aboard the fleeing UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn , selects random coordinates that lead the ship to a Halo installation. The Covenant follow, damaging the Autumn and leading its crew to take the fight to the ring's surface. The Covenant accidentally release Flood imprisoned on the ring; in order to nullify the threat, the ring's AI caretaker, 343 Guilty Spark , enlists the help of the Spartan, John-117 , or Master Chief. However, before the pair can activate Halo's defenses, Cortana reveals that Halo's activation would mean their own destruction. Master Chief and Cortana instead detonate the Autumn ' s engines, destroying Halo and preventing the escape of the Flood. They return to Earth with a few other human survivors, warning of an impending Covenant attack. The Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05 , in order to fulfill their religious prophecy. [ 14 ] and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the Earth are Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes . One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings and join forces with humanity in order to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from one location, referred to as the Ark . [ 15 ] Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings, the Covenant High Prophet of Truth and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried. A battle rages on Earth between human forces, the Covenant, and a Flood-infected army. Eventually, the Covenant is repulsed and flees through a slipspace portal, and the Flood is purged from Earth, resulting in the devastation of much of Africa.
<p> Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes, and their troops follow Truth through the portal, joined by 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld. During the ensuing battle between humans, Covenant, and the Flood on the Ark, Johnson is captured by Truth, himself infected by Flood, to activate the Halo rings. Keyes tries to intervene, but is killed by Truth. Master Chief and the Arbiter, aided by the Flood, take down Truth and rescue Johnson. After finding out that the Ark is constructing a replacement for Guilty Spark's Halo installation, Master Chief decides to fire the unstable Halo, destroying both the Flood and the Ark, and manages to rescue Cortana to use the Activation Index she contains. After finding out about their plan, Guilty Spark kills Johnson and tries to kill Master Chief, but Master Chief destroys Guilty Spark and activates the Halo. Master Chief and the Arbiter attempt to escape on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn , but the slipspace portal, impacted by the Halo's blastwave, shuts with Master Chief's half trapped in space. After a memorial service on Earth for the victims of the Human-Covenant war, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet. But it is shown that the rear half of Forward Unto Dawn is floating in space, with the Chief and Cortana on board. Cortana activates a distress beacon and the Chief goes into hibernation.
<p> Four years later, the Chief and Cortana awake to find they are being attacked by a Covenant splinter group. Caught in an artificial gravity well , they are pulled down, with the remains of the Forward Unto Dawn , onto the artificial Forerunner planet of Requiem, along with the UNSC ship Infinity . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Master Chief, fighting both Covenant and AI soldiers called Prometheans, unwittingly releases a hostile Forerunner warrior called the Didact. While seeking a way to combat the Didact, Cortana reveals that she is becoming Rampant, a state in AIs when their knowledge base becomes too large and they gradually go insane. Master Chief is eventually contacted by a Forerunner consciousness called the Librarian, who tells him about the Didact: during the crisis with the Flood, the Didact tried to use a device called the Composer to transform humanity into creatures like the Prometheans. He was imprisoned by his own race, with Forerunner soldiers and humans he had already converted as his guardians, and the Composer hidden. After the Didact leaves Requiem and retrieves the Composer, Master Chief pursues him to Earth, with Master Chief and Cortana working together to destroy the Composer. Master Chief succeeds, but Cortana sacrifices herself to save him from the resultant explosion. Master Chief is later found floating among the rubble, and taken back to the Infinity.
<p> The games of the main Halo trilogy were developed by Bungie , and are first-person shooters in which the player experiences most action from the protagonist's perspective. [ 18 ] The first title in the series is the Xbox version of Halo: Combat Evolved , released on November 15, 2001. [ 19 ] The game was initially intended to be released for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows platforms, until Microsoft 's purchase of Bungie in 2000 led to the game becoming an Xbox launch title and platform exclusive. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Halo: Combat Evolved introduced many gameplay and plot themes common to the whole trilogy. Players battle various aliens on foot and in vehicles to complete objectives, while attempting to uncover the secrets of the eponymous Halo. One concept introduced in Halo: Combat Evolved , is limiting the number of weapons players could carry to two, forcing them to carefully select their preferred armament. [ 22 ] Players fight with ranged and melee attacks, as well as a limited number of grenades. Bungie refers to the "weapons-grenades-melee" format as the "Golden Triangle of Halo ", [ 23 ] which has remained fundamentally unchanged throughout the trilogy. In Halo: Combat Evolved , the player's health is measured in both hit points and a continually recharging energy shield. [ 24 ] A Windows and Mac OS X port was later developed by Gearbox Software , and released on September 30 and November 11, 2003 respectively. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] A stand-alone expansion, entitled Halo: Custom Edition , was released as a Windows exclusive, and allowed players to create custom content for the game.
<p> Its sequel, Halo 2 was released on the Xbox on November 9, 2004 and later for Windows Vista on May 17, 2007. For the first time, the game was released in two different editions: a standard edition with just the game disc and traditional Xbox packaging; and the Collector's Edition with a specially designed aluminum case, along with an additional bonus DVD, extra booklet, and slightly different user manual. Halo 2 introduced new gameplay elements, chief among them the ability to hold and fire two weapons simultaneously, known as "dual wielding". [ 27 ] Unlike its predecessor, Halo 2 fully supported online multiplayer via Xbox Live . The game uses "matchmaking" to facilitate joining online matches by grouping players looking for certain types of games. [ 27 ] This was a change from the more traditional "server list" approach, which was used to find matches in online games at this time. Upon release, Halo 2 became the game played by the most people on the Xbox Live service that week; it retained this title for over two years - the longest streak any game has held the spot. [ 28 ]
<p> Halo 3 is the final game in the main Halo trilogy, ending the story arc begun in Halo: Combat Evolved . [ 29 ] The game was released on the Xbox 360 on September 25, 2007. [ 30 ] It adds to the series new vehicles, new weapons, and a class of items called equipment. [ 31 ] The game also includes a limited map-editing tool, known as the Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and crates, into existing multiplayer map geometry. [ 32 ] Players can also save a recording of their gameplay sessions, and view them as video, from any angle. [ 33 ]
<p> The making of future Halo games was given over to the specially created 343 Industries [ 34 ] after the separation of Bungie from Microsoft. [ 35 ] 343 had already co-developed both a special animated series and overseen Halo Reach and an HD remake of the original Halo game . [ 36 ] The next game in the series, Halo 4 , was announced at E3 2011 as the first entry in a new series of Halo games, at the time dubbed the "Reclaimer trilogy". [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The game included many staples of previous games, such as new or redesigned weapon types, [ 39 ] an improved map-editing tool [ 40 ] and expanded multiplayer options and maps. [ 41 ] It also incorporated a new competitive multiplayer mode titled Grifball [ 42 ] and enabled players to go through the main campaign in single-player or mutliplayer modes. [ 43 ] Halo 4 was released worldwide on November 6, 2012, [ 44 ] achieving record sales for the franchise. [ 45 ] In a new addition to the series, a story-driven multiplayer campaign entitled Spartan Ops was released over the weeks following Halo 4 ' s release, telling what happened after the end of the main game. [ 46 ]
<p> At E3 2013, Microsoft announced a new, then untitled addition to the Halo series, along with a trailer appearing to depict a post- Halo 4 Master Chief. [ 47 ] The upcoming Halo game is confirmed to be only on the Xbox One , and claimed to run at 60 frames per second . After E3, Microsoft Studios corporate vice president Phil Spencer said that the "Reclaimer Trilogy" had been expanded into a longer series of games, saying they "[didn't] want to limit the Reclaimer story within a trilogy". [ 48 ] Spencer also clarified in an interview with IGN that while the next-gen game was not Halo 5 , it was a "legitimate" entry in the game series rather than a spin-off. On May 16, 2014, Microsoft confirmed that the next Halo game will be titled Halo 5: Guardians . [ 49 ]
<p> The success of the main Halo trilogy spurred the creation of spin-off games. Halo Wars is a real-time strategy game developed by Ensemble Studios for the Xbox 360 . Set in the year 2531, the game takes place 21 years prior to the events of Halo: Combat Evolved . Much effort was spent on developing a control scheme that was simple and intuitive, unlike other console strategy games. [ 50 ] The game was announced at X06 , and released in February and March 2009.
<p> In a July 2008 interview with MTV , Microsoft's head of Xbox business, Don Mattrick, stated that Bungie was working on a new Halo game for Microsoft , independent of other Halo projects. An announcement of the new Halo project was expected at the 2008 E3 game exposition, which Bungie stated "has been building for several months", but was delayed by their publisher Microsoft. [ 51 ] The Halo announcement was to be part of Microsoft's 150-minute E3 presentation, and was cut to trim the presentation down to 90 minutes; Microsoft stated it wanted to give the game its own dedicated event. [ 52 ] After the release of an ambiguous teaser trailer on September 25, [ 53 ] the project was revealed as Halo 3: Recon , later changed to Halo 3: ODST . Set between the events of Halo 2 and Halo 3 , players take control of elite human soldiers called Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODST). The game was released on September 22, 2009.
<p> Announced at E3 2009, Halo: Reach is a prequel to the main trilogy and Bungie's last Halo game. Players control Noble Six, a "Hyper Lethal Vector" who is one of the members of the Spartan squad "Noble Team" as they defend Reach against the Covenant. The ending of the game leads directly into the events of Combat Evolved . The game was released on September 14, 2010.
<p> Alternate reality games were used to promote the release of the games in the main trilogy. The Cortana Letters , a series of cryptic email messages, were circulated by Bungie prior to Halo: Combat Evolved ' s release. [ 54 ] I Love Bees was used to promote the release of Halo2 . The game revolved around a website created by 42 Entertainment , commissioned by Microsoft and endorsed by Bungie. Over the course of the game, audio clips were released that eventually formed a complete five-hour story set on Earth between Halo and Halo2 . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Similarly, Iris was used as a viral marketing campaign for the release of Halo3 . [ 57 ] It featured five web servers containing various media files related to the Halo universe.
<p> Spin-off titles were planned for release on handheld systems, but did not progress far in development. Rumors of a handheld Halo title for the Game Boy Advance surfaced in 2004. Bungie denied the rumors and commented that such a project between Microsoft and Nintendo would be "very unlikely". [ 58 ] At a Las Vegas consumer technology convention in January 2005, rumors spread about a version of Halo for the handheld Gizmondo system. Bungie denied the rumors stating they were not making a game for the system. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] A former Gizmondo employee later revealed development only extended to basic story and game structure concepts to obtain funding from investors. [ 61 ] In 2006, a concept video for Microsoft's portable Ultra-Mobile PC featured footage of Halo and caused speculation for a handheld title. Microsoft later stated the footage was for demonstration purposes only; Halo was included because it was a Microsoft-owned property. [ 62 ] In January 2007, IGN editor-in-chief Matt Casamassina claimed he played a version of Halo for the Nintendo DS . [ 63 ] He later demonstrated on-camera, in-game footage of an early-development style version of Halo DS . [ 64 ] The demonstrated work featured dual-wielding and a version of the Halo2 map Zanzibar. [ 63 ] On October 5, 2007, Bungie employee Brian Jarrard explained the Halo DS demo was in fact an unsolicited pitch that was never taken on. [ 65 ]
<p> In 2006, Microsoft announced an episodic video game to be developed by film director Peter Jackson 's Wingnut Interactive. [ 66 ] The game, dubbed Halo: Chronicles , was confirmed to be in development in 2007, [ 67 ] and by 2008 was still hiring for positions on the development team. [ 68 ] Jackson told game blog Joystiq in July 2009 that the project was no longer in development. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Jackson's manager Ken Kamins explained that the project was cancelled as part of budget cuts tied to job layoffs in January 2009. [ 71 ]
<p> Before the company was shuttered after producing Halo Wars , Ensemble Studios had been working on a Halo -themed massively multiplayer online game , often referred to as Titan Project , or just Titan . The project was cancelled internally in 2007-2008, without a formal announcement from Microsoft. [ 72 ] [ 73 ]
<p> Bungie (formerly Bungie Software Products Corporation) is a game development company started in 1991 by Alex Seropian . Seropian partnered with programmer Jason Jones to market and release Jones' game Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete . Focusing on the Macintosh game market because it was smaller and easier to compete, Bungie became the biggest Mac developer with games including the shooters Pathways Into Darkness and Marathon . What became Halo was originally code-named Monkey Nuts and Blam! , [ 76 ] and took place on a hollowed-out world called Solipsis. [ 77 ] The planet eventually became a ringworld , and an artist suggested the name "Halo", which became the game's title. [ 78 ]
<p> The first Halo game was announced on July 21, 1999, during the Macworld Conference & Expo . [ 79 ] It was originally planned to be a real-time strategy game for the Mac and Windows operating systems, but later changed into a third-person action game. [ 20 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] On June 19, 2000, Microsoft acquired Bungie Studios and Halo: Combat Evolved became a launch title for the Xbox video game console . [ 21 ] After receiving Xbox development kits, Bungie Studios rewrote the game's engine, heavily altered its presentation, and turned it into a first-person shooter . Though the first Halo was meant to include an online multiplayer mode, it was excluded because Xbox Live was not yet available. [ 81 ]
<p> Halo was not intended to be the Xbox's flagship game due to internal concerns and gaming press criticism, but Microsoft VP of game publishing Ed Fries did not act on these concerns. The Xbox's marketing heavily featured Halo , whose green color palette meshed with the console's design scheme. [ 82 ]
<p> The success of the game led to a sequel, Halo2 , which was announced on August 8, 2002 at the Microsoft's New York X02 press event. [ 83 ] It featured improved graphics, new weapons, and a multiplayer mode on Xbox Live. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Halo3 was announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo . [ 86 ] The initial conception for the third game was done before Halo2 was released in 2004. [ 87 ] It utilized a proprietary, in-house graphics engine , and employed advanced graphics technologies. [ 88 ] [ 89 ]
<p> They created two more Halo games before becoming independent as part of their deal with Microsoft: a side story Halo 3: ODST and a prequel Halo: Reach in 2009 and 2010 respectively.
<p> Following the release of Halo 3 , Bungie announced it was splitting off from Microsoft and becoming an independent limited liability company. While Bungie remained involved in the Halo series by developing games such as ODST and Reach , the rights to Halo remain with Microsoft. To oversee everything Halo , Microsoft created an internal division, 343 Industries , [ 90 ] serving as "stewards" for the franchise. [ 91 ] Frank O'Connor, formerly a Bungie employee, [ 92 ] now serves as 343's creative director. [ 90 ]
<p> In announcing the formation of 343 Industries, Microsoft also announced that Xbox Live would be home to a central hub for Halo content called Halo Waypoint. [ 93 ] Waypoint is accessed from the Xbox 360 Dashboard and offers players access to multimedia content in addition to tracking their Halo game "career". O'Connor described Waypoint as intended to be the prime destination for Halo . [ 94 ]
<p> The company's first new game, Halo 4 , was released on November 6, 2012, to generally positive reviews.
<p> In 2006, in acknowledgement of the "wealth of influences adopted by the Bungie team", a list of Bungie employees' favorite science fiction material was published on the company's website. [ 95 ] The developers acknowledged that the Halo series' use of ring-shaped megastructures followed on from concepts featured in Larry Niven 's Ringworld and Iain M. Banks ' Culture series (of which Consider Phlebas [ 96 ] and Excession [ 95 ] were said to be particularly influential). In a retrospective article in Edge , Bungie's Jaime Griesemer commented, "The influence of something like Ringworld isn't necessarily in the design-it's in that feeling of being somewhere else. That sense of scale and an epic story going on out there." [ 96 ] Griesemer also explained, "One of the main sources of inspiration was Armor [by John Steakley ], in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war over and over again. That sense of hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential." [ 96 ] The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species in Christopher Rowley 's The Vang ; [ 96 ] it has also been speculated that the Master Chief's name "John 117" may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley's Starhammer , [ 97 ] or to the John Spartan character of Demolition Man . [ 98 ] An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in the Halo franchise commented on similarities between Halo and Orson Scott Card 's Ender's Game : aspects of the SPARTAN Project and the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel. [ 97 ] Bungie has also acknowledged James Cameron 's film Aliens as a strong cinematic influence. [ 99 ]
<p> A report written by Roger Travis and published by The Escapist compares Halo with the Latin epic Aeneid , written by classical Roman poet Virgil . Travis posits similarities between the plots of both works and compares the characters present in them, with the Flood and Covenant taking the role performed by the Carthaginians, and the Master Chief's role in the series to that of Aeneas . [ 100 ]
<p> Seven Halo soundtracks have been released. The Halo Original Soundtrack contains most of Combat Evolved ' s music. Due to the varying nature of gameplay, the music present was designed to use the game's dynamic audio playback engine. The engine allows for the mood, theme, and duration of music played to change according to gameplay. [ 101 ] To afford a more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites , which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including a variation on the Halo theme that was first played at Halo ' s debut at Macworld 1999. [ 102 ]
<p> For Halo 2 ' s soundtrack , producer Nile Rodgers and O'Donnell decided to split the music into two separate volumes. The first, Volume One, was released on November 9, 2004 and contained all the themes as well as the "inspired-by" music present in the game (featuring Steve Vai , Incubus , Hoobastank , and Breaking Benjamin ). The second release, Volume 2, contained the rest of the music, much of which was incomplete or not included in the first soundtrack, as the first soundtrack was shipped before the game was released. [ 103 ] Halo2 , unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5.1 Digital Surround Sound . [ 104 ]
<p> The soundtrack for Halo 3 was released on November 20, 2007. O'Donnell noted he wanted to bring back the themes from the original game in order to help tie together the end of the trilogy. [ 105 ] The tracks are presented, similarly to the previous soundtrack for Halo 2 , [ 103 ] in a suite form. Unlike previous soundtracks, where much of the music had been synthesized on computer, the soundtrack for Halo 3 was recorded using a 60-piece orchestra, along with a 24-voice chorus. [ 106 ] The final soundtrack was recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Studio X in Seattle, Washington. [ 107 ] The soundtracks were bundled and released as a box set in December 2008. [ 108 ] A soundtrack for Halo 3: ODST was released alongside the game and included many of the tracks from the game. [ 109 ]
<p> For Halo Wars , the task of creating the game's music fell to Stephen Rippy . Rippy listened to O'Donnell's soundtracks for inspiration and incorporated the Halo theme into parts of his arrangements. In addition to synthesized and orchestral components, the composer focused on the choir and piano as essential elements, feeling these were important in creating the " Halo sound". [ 110 ] Rather than use the Northwest Sinfonia, Rippy travelled to Prague and recorded with the FILMharmonic Orchestra before returning to the United States to complete the music. A standalone compact disc and digital download retail version of the soundtrack was announced in January 2009 for release on February 17. [ 111 ]
<p> The Halo franchise includes various types of merchandise and adaptations outside of the video games. This includes bestselling novels, graphic novels, and other licensed products, from action figures to a packaging tie-in with Mountain Dew . Numerous action figures and vehicles based on Halo have been produced. Joyride Studios created Halo and Halo2 action figures, while Halo3 poseable and collectible action figures, aimed at collectors, were produced by McFarlane Toys and became some of the top-selling action figures of 2007 and 2008. [ 112 ] MEGA Blocks partnered with Microsoft to produce Halo Wars -themed toys. [ 113 ]
<p> There have been numerous printed adaptations based on the Halo canon established by the video games. Larry Niven (author of Ringworld ) was originally approached to write a Halo novelization, but declined due to unfamiliarity with the subject matter. [ 114 ] The first novel was Halo: The Fall of Reach , a prequel to Halo: Combat Evolved . It was written by Eric Nylund in seven weeks, and published in October 2001. [ 115 ] William C. Dietz wrote an adaptation of Halo: Combat Evolved called Halo: The Flood , which was released in 2003. [ 116 ] Eric Nylund returned to write the third novel, Halo: First Strike , which takes place between Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo2 , and was published in December 2003. Nylund also wrote the fourth adaptation, Halo: Ghosts of Onyx , which was published on October 31, 2006. [ 117 ] Bungie employee Joseph Staten wrote the fifth book, Halo: Contact Harvest , which was released on October 30, 2007, while Tobias S. Buckell produced the sixth, Halo: The Cole Protocol , published in November 2008. Bungie considers the Halo novels as additions to the Halo canon. [ 118 ]
<p> A collection of Halo stories, Halo: Evolutions , was simultaneously released in print and audiobook formats in November 2009. Evolutions includes original material by Nylund, Buckell, Karen Traviss and contributions from Bungie. [ 119 ] Tor re-released the first three Halo novels with new content and cover art. [ 120 ] Science fiction author Greg Bear wrote a trilogy of books focusing on the Forerunners, called The Forerunner Saga . The first book, entitled Halo: Cryptum , was released in January 2011, [ 121 ] followed by Primordium in January 2012 and Silentium on March 19, 2013. [ 122 ] Karen Traviss is writing the Kilo-Five trilogy, which takes place after the events of Halo 3 and Halo: Ghosts of Onyx . [ 123 ] The first book, Halo: Glasslands , came out October 2011, followed by Halo: The Thursday War on October 2, 2012, and Halo: Mortal Dictata in January 21, 2014.
<p> Marvel announced at the 2009 Comic Con that two new comics, a five-part series written by Peter David and a second series written by Fred Van Lente , would appear the coming summer and winter. [ 126 ] David's series, Halo: Helljumper , is set prior to Halo: Combat Evolved and focuses on the elite Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. The five-part series was published between July and November 2009. [ 127 ] Lente's series, originally titled Spartan Black , revolves around a black ops team of Spartan supersoldiers assigned to the UNSC Office of Naval Intelligence. [ 128 ] The rebranded comic, Halo: Blood Line , debuted in December 2009. [ 129 ] A comic-retelling of the novel Halo: The Fall of Reach was the most recent comic series entitled: Halo: Fall of Reach . Fall of Reach was split into three mini-stories: Boot Camp , Covenant , and Invasion .
<p> In 2005, Columbia Pictures president Peter Schlessel began working outside the studio system to produce a Halo filmic adaptation. Alex Garland wrote the first script, [ 130 ] which was then pitched to studios by couriers dressed as Master Chief. Microsoft's terms required $10 million against 15percent of gross; most studios passed, citing the lack of risk for Microsoft compared to their large share of potential profits. 20th Century Fox and Universal Studios decided to partner to produce the film, paying Microsoft $5 million to option the film and 10percent of grosses. [ 131 ] Peter Jackson was slated to be the executive producer , [ 132 ] with Neill Blomkamp as director. Before Blomkamp signed on, Guillermo del Toro was in negotiations to direct. [ 133 ]
<p> D. B. Weiss and Josh Olson rewrote Garland's script during 2006. [ 134 ] The crew stopped and resumed preproduction of the film several times. [ 135 ] Later that year, 20th Century Fox threatened to pull out of the project, leading Universal to issue an ultimatum to Jackson and Schlessel: either cut their large "first-dollar" deals, or the project was ended. Both refused, and the project stalled. [ 131 ]
<p> Blomkamp declared the project dead in late 2007, [ 136 ] but Jackson replied that the film would still be made. [ 137 ] Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9 , but the director told /Film that he was no longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, [ 138 ] saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse it would be difficult to return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft. [ 139 ]
<p> Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn is a live-action film and miniseries set in the Halo universe. Although shot as a feature-length film, Forward Unto Dawn was originally released as a webseries consisting of five roughly 15-minute episodes, the first of which was released on October 5, 2012, with the last episode released on November 2, 2012. The series' plot, occurring in the early days of the Human-Covenant War circa 2526, revolves around Thomas Lasky, a young cadet at Corbulo Academy of Military Science, and how John-117 inspired him to eventually become a leader.
