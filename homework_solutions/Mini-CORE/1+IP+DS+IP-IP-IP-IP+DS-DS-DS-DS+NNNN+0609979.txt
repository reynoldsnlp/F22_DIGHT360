<h> Talk About The Weather/Paint Your Wagon - Red Lorry Yellow Lorry
<p> UNFORTUNATELY THIS TITLE IS CURRENTLY OUT OF STOCK. Cherry Red Records apologises for the unavailability of this album, however if you would like to be notified when it is on sale again then please email matti@cherryred.co.uk . Thanks. Both of these albums reached the top of the independent charts in the mid 80s and are here on one CD for the first time. 18 tracks including the indie chart singles Hollow Eyes, This Today and Walking On Your Hands. The booklet includes the original artworks for the albums and all their singles.
<p> Sad Lovers and Giants originally formed in 1981 and produced 'classy alternative pop music', a psychedelic post punk sound. The guitars chimed above atmospheric keyboards held together by a rock solid rhythm section underpinning very accessible song writing and the strong haunting voice of singer Garce.
<p> Think Chameleons, early Cure and latterly bands like Interpol. After their initial split in 1984 interest in the band grew at home and abroad prompting them into reforming in the late 80's and producing several more great albums but 'Epic Garden Music' is the starting point.
<p> Released 20/07/2009. Sad Lovers and Giants first full album, a brilliant atmospheric post punk album, elements of Joy Division and The Chameleons and more tellingly of bands that followed. Recorded in 1983 Feeding the Flame showcases the original line up at their very best. Just completed successful European dates more in the pipeline. Not available on CD since 1988 and includes four bonus tracks that were not on the original vinyl. Memorabilia and Sleeve notes contributions from the original band members
<p> Released on 22/02/10. Sad Lovers and Giants took a break after the Feeding The Flame album, interest in the band continued to grow and they reformed with a new line up and a new set of songs. The Mirror Test is a brilliant atmospheric post punk album, elements of Joy Division and The Chameleons and more tellingly of bands that followed. Originally released in 1988 - The Mirror Test marked the return of Sad Lovers And Giants, after a couple of years away from the scene with a new line up and a stronger sound.
<p> Staffordshire's Balaam & The Angel were at the forefront of the 80s Goth movement, playing alongside some of the biggest bands of the day, and releasing a succession of acclaimed records through both their own Chapter 22 independent label and later, the major, Virgin Records. This, their second album released in the summer of 1988, has been beautifully remastered and repackaged with the direct assistance of the band. Includes the singles 'I Love The Things You Do To Me", 'I'll Show You Something Special', and bonus tracks especially selected by the band. In addition to the Goth movement, Balaam & The Angel were also hugely popular with rock critics. Sleeve-notes have been written in collaboration with Des Morris of the band, who provides insights on the album and the times. Balaam & The Angel are now reforming and expecting to play a series of high-profile gigs at the turn of 2008.
<p> Cherry Red are pleased to announce the release of Danse Society's third and final studio album, 'Looking Through'. Formed in Barnsley in 1980 from the remnants of local post-punk bands Y? and Lips-X, Danse Society comprised vocalist Steve Rawlings, bass player Tim Wright, guitarist Paul Nash, drummer Paul Gilmartin and keyboard player Lyndon Scarfe. Cherry Red is pleased that another of the enduring recordings of this astonishingly dramatic band is given the chance to breath again. The combination of sonic belligerence and a decorous, almost wistful touch will see that Danse Society will always be remembered as a band with a unique sense of style and musical occasion. The group's prior history is fully explored in two previous Cherry Red compilations, 'Seduction (The Society Collection)' and 'Heaven Is Waiting'.
