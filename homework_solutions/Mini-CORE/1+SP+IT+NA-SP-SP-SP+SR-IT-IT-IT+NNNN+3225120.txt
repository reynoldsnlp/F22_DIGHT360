<p> "The initial reaction is I understand lines being drawn or being connected. I get that. I understand it because it's a simple thing to do. The fact is in my four years here I have never, ever made a decision on which players will be inactive, who gets playing time, who doesn't get playing time, who is going to be the starting quarterback or the starting safety. That is not my role as the general manager."
<p> "Coaches make those decisions."
<p> "There's never been a time in my four years here or anywhere else where I made a demand or suggestion as to who should play which position That's not my job. That's the coaches job."
<p> On drafting a quarterback:
<p> (Not a direct quote): Pioli said that the Chiefs haven't had a good opportunity to draft a quarterback that they like.
<p> "I think it's a critical part of the job. Getting a quarterback and building the right team. I still believe in that. I've been fortunate to be part of successes, not just at this level, at other levels and you see that the quarterback position is critical but there's also this big picture idea that you have to build a team."
<p> Random:
<p> Pioli didn't know there was a presidential debate last night.
<p> He does not dress up for Halloween but was recently told he was masquerading as a general manager.
<p> On Eric Winston:
<p> "When we were recruiting Eric to be a free agent, the reason Eric was in this building and wanted to be here is because he loves Arrowhead Stadium, he loves the sea of red and the fans." Pioli said Winston still likes being in KC.
