<p> If I said that you're my everything. Would you come and run after me? Would you tell me the same thing? If I run, I want you to run with me.
<p> The rain is falling down And the clouds are re-uniting. The trees are swaying from side to side, And my heart, it's breaking. Oh, when it's morning over here. It's goodnight for you over there. But still, I won't ever stop caring for you. Cause we're in different places But we're looking at the same moon.
<p> If I said that you're an inspiration. Would you believe me? Would you tell me the same thing? If I run, I want you to run with me. The rain is falling down And the clouds are re-uniting. The trees are swaying from side to side, And my heart, it's breaking. Oh, when it's morning over here. It's goodnight for you over there. But still, I won't ever stop caring for you. Cause we're in different places But we're looking at the same moon.
<p> I try to let you know every day. What you mean to me. And even though you're far away. I will never be too blind to see. That you're amazing, and beautiful. You can catch me when I fall. Even if you don't know, just yet. I won't ever give up, up, up.
<p> The rain is falling down And the clouds are re-uniting. The trees are swaying from side to side, And my heart, it's breaking. Oh, when it's morning over here. It's goodnight for you over there. But still, I won't ever stop caring for you. Cause we're in different places But we're looking at the same moon.
<p> My tears are falling down. And me and the sadness re-unite. My walls are closing in on me. I'm strong enough to win this fight! I'm strong enough to win this fight!
<p> I won't ever stop telling the truth. Yeah, we're in different countries. But we're looking at the same moon...
