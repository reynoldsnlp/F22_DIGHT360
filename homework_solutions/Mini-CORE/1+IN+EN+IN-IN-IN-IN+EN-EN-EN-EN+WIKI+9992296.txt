<p> This is a list of extreme points of Earth , the points that are farther north, south, east or west than, higher or lower in elevation than, or farthest inland or out to sea from, any other locations on the landmasses , continents or countries .
<p> The westernmost and easternmost points of the world , based on the normal practice of using longitude, can be found anywhere along the 180th meridian in Siberia (including Wrangel Island ), Antarctica, or the three islands of Fiji through which the 180th meridian passes ( Vanua Levu's eastern peninsula, the middle of Taveuni , and the western part of Rabi Island )
<p> The easternmost point on land , according to the path of the International Date Line, is Caroline Island , Kiribati 1
<p> 1 A 1995 realignment of the International Date Line ( [1] ) moved all of Kiribati to the Asian side of the Date Line, causing Caroline Island to be the easternmost. However, if the previous Date Line were followed, the easternmost point would be Tafahi Niuatoputapu, in the Tonga Islands chain.
<p> The point farthest from the Earth's center is the summit of Chimborazo , in Ecuador , at 6,268m (20,564ft). This is due to the Earth being an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere . An oblate spheroid is very much like a sphere except it is wider at the equator and narrower between the poles. This means that Chimborazo, which is near the equator, is farther away from the center of the Earth than is the peak of Mount Everest. The summit of Mount Everest is 2,168m (7,113ft) closer at 6,382.3km (3,965.8mi) to the Earth's center. Peru 's Huascarn contends closely with Chimborazo, the difference in the mountains' heights being 23m (75ft) [ citation needed ]
<p> The lowest point underground is more than 2,000 metres (6,600ft) under surface. For example the altitude difference in the Voronya Cave between the entrance and the deepest explored point (its depth) is 2,19120 metres (7,18866ft). In 2012, Ukrainian cave diver Gennadiy Samokhin has reached the lowest point, breaking the world record. [ 4 ]
<p> The point closest to the Earth's centre (~6,353km (3,948mi)) is probably at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean (greatest depth 5,450m (17,881ft)) near the Geographic North Pole (the bottom of the Mariana Trench is near 6,370km (3,958mi) from the centre of the Earth).
<p> Road (mountain pass): Mana Pass on the India - Tibet border contains a well-graded military road built in the 2005-2010 period that reaches 5,610 metres (18,406ft) 250m west of the low point of the pass at 5,545 metres (18,192ft). Semo La in Tibet 5,565m (18,258ft) or Marsimik La in India, 5,582m (18,314ft), are other contenders, depending on the definition of "attainable by transportation". There may be higher motorable passes in Tibet in areas affected by lack of information and restricted access. See Khardung La , India 5,359 metres (17,582ft), for more information.
<p> Road (asphalted): The Ticlio pass, on the Central Road of Peru, at an elevation of 4,818 meters.
<p> Lake: There is an unnamed crater lake on Ojos del Salado (which itself is the world's highest volcano) at 6,390m (20,965ft), [ 10 ] on the Argentina-Chile border (the lake is in Argentina). Another candidate is Lhagba Pool on the northeast slopes of Mount Everest , Tibet, China at an elevation of 6,368m (20,892ft). [ 11 ]
<p> Navigable Lake: Lake Titicaca , on the border of Peru and Bolivia in the Andes , 3,812m (12,507ft)
<p> Glacier: The Khumbu Glacier on the southwest slopes of Mount Everest in Nepal is the world's highest glacier, beginning on the west side of Lhotse at an elevation of 7,600m (24,934ft) to 8,000m (26,247ft). [ 12 ]
<p> Coincidentally, EPIA1 (or EPIA2) and the most remote of the Oceanic Poles of Inaccessibility (specifically, the point in the South Pacific Ocean that is farthest from land) are similarly remote; EPIA1 is less than 200km (120mi) closer to the ocean than the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility is to land.
<p> The most remote city with a population in excess of one million is Auckland , New Zealand. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is Sydney , Australia, 2,168.9 kilometres (1,347.7mi) away. [ 18 ] Coming in a close second at 2,139 kilometres (air travel distance) is Perth , Australia. Its nearest city of at least one million population is Adelaide , Australia.
<p> The most remote city with a population in excess of 500,000 is Honolulu , United States. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is San Francisco , 3,841km (2,387mi) away.
<p> The most remote capital city in the world (longest distance from one capital of a sovereign country to the one closest to it) is a tie between Wellington , New Zealand, and Canberra , Australia, which are 2,326km (1,445mi) apart from each other. Canberra could drop from this tie in the future as it is only 2,217km (1,378mi) from Noumea , [ 20 ] the capital of New Caledonia , a special territory of France which is scheduled to vote on independence between 2014 and 2018. [ 21 ]
<p> Since the Earth is a spheroid , its center (the core) is thousands of kilometres beneath its crust . On the surface, the point 0, 0, located in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 614km (382mi) south of Accra , Ghana , in the Gulf of Guinea , at the intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian , at the coordinates of zero degrees by zero, is the "center" of the standard geographic model, as viewed on a map-but this selection of longitude meridian is culturally and historically dependent. The center of population , the place to which there is the shortest average route for everyone in the world, could be considered a centre of the world , and is located in the north of the Indian subcontinent , although the precise location has never been calculated and is constantly shifting.
<p> The longest land meridian . Still to be determined. It has to be located in the vicinity of 22E, which is the longest land integer meridian that crosses 13,035km (8,100mi) of land and takes more than 65% of the meridian's length. Note: the meridian that crosses Giza Great Pyramid (3108'3.69"E) is 855km (532mi) shorter.
<p> Longest continuous distance at sea: There are several possible ways to travel along a great circle for more than the antipodic length of 19,840km (12,330mi). Some good examples of such routes would be:
