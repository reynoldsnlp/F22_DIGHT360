<h> Long Island Exchange could be replaced by flats and houses
<p> By Ben Endley
<p> 10:00am Thursday 15th November 2012
<p> One of Rickmansworth's most prominent local landmarks could be demolished and replaced with a modern block of flats.
<p> The Long Island Exchange hotel is the first thing many people see when they exit the station but few realise the main building dates back to approximately 1888, making it the oldest and only surviving hotel in the town.
<p> Property developer Keay Homes has applied for planning permission to demolish the 120-year-old hotel - which was at one stage home to composer Arnold Bax and was the venue for The Proms for two years during World War Two - and replace it with 87 modern flats and five townhouses.
<p> On learning of the application, Rickmansworth councillor Paula Hiscocks , a member of the planning committee at Three Rivers District Council , and Councillor David Sansom sought to have the property locally listed as an important historical building, a move that would afford it special protection.
<p> They were told the building did not meet the criteria to be added to the borough's 350 locally listed buildings, a decision they both contest.
<p> In addition, Councillor Hiscocks was banned from joining in discussions or votes on the application by council chief executive Steven Halls after allegedly "predetermining" her views on the application.
<p> She said: "We had a meeting with the chief executive after he initially said no [to locally listed status], he told us he would be happy to see it demolished.
<p> "We want to know why this can't now be locally listed as I believe not including it in the first place was an oversight.
<p> "It is a lovely building inside and the hotel is well used by people on business and those visiting Watersmeet . If there is no hotel, the town will lose business.
<p> "This is a good building, it has got a lot of historic interest and it's a landmark - if we lose this we're not going to get it back.
<p> "If this is what the council want to do in Rickmansworth then let's pull the whole thing down and build Milton Keynes."
<p> Councillor Hiscocks also denies she has made up her mind about the application, saying she would accept a conversion to apartments provided the structure of the pub - formerly the Victoria Hotel - was protected.
<p> She said: "This is supposed to be a democracy but one officer has made the decision not to locally list it and there can be no appeals process.
<p> "This is a landmark building but I do not go in with a concrete frame of mind, I go into it with an opinion as any other councillor would.
<p> "I'm thinking about it no differently to how any other councillor would."
<p> In a statement, Mr Halls said: "Committee members who make objections to, and take a fixed stance on, a planning application prior to it coming to a committee meeting and who have firmly made up their mind in advance on how they will deal with the application, cannot then take part in and vote on that application.
<p> "To do so with such a closed mind would amount to bias and predetermination which would jeopardise the whole decision making process.
<p> "As with other planning committee meetings, the discussion and vote will be held in public.
<p> "Residents are welcome to attend and there will be the usual opportunity for them to speak for or against an application, in line with the committee's usual procedure."
<p> The site was listed in the council's Local Development Framework in 2009 as a suitable location for housing to be built. The developer's application is due to be heard early next year.
<p> That really is a very prominent landmark, and I would very greatly saddened if it is replaced by another generic stack of "little boxes on a hillside". We've lost so many distinctive and characterful properties in the area already; The Rice House springs to mind immediately, and though we have gained a few distinctive new apartment blocks, like the one on the old auctioneer site opposite Watford High Street, those gains should not come at the expense of Hertfordshire's characterful buildings.

<p> Stitch-up against the people of Rickmansworth.
<p> This should be listed as a local landmark of character and history.
<p> Another block of bloody characterless flats? No thanks!

<p> it seems such a strange stance for the chief exec Steven Halls to adopt when refering to one of Rickmansworths oldest and biggest buildings, The fact that he would be happy to see it demolished disturbs me somewhat and the fact that he is THDC chief executive even more so. It would be a total outrage to see this building go! why is steven Hills set on this building going?

<p> I find it somewhat bizarre that a coucillor, who is only there TO REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED THEM is barred from taking part in the vote because they already know what they want as the outcome.
<p> This is a planning application, not a jury on a murder trial!

<p> Rickmansworth railway station opened up in 1887 then the Victoria Hotel opposite in 1888 to accomodate visitors to the area brought in by the Metropolitan Railway by 1894 you could of walked over to the Hotel's stables and hired a "fly" a one horse two wheeled light carriage operated by G.T Bunce, a bit of a difference than jumping into a Boughtons cab from outside the station nowadays ! i think this building is certainly worth saving, but looks like one man has the monopoly on what happens to it ! dont you just love democracy

<p> Urgh. I had the misfortune to have to drive through Slough recently. Same story. Characterful old properties erased by a swathe of "designer" boxes. Ugly, horrible and a dis-service to our both our heritage and our grandchildren.

<p> I remember it well as the Victoria Hotel, with a lot of character and a good restaurant which we frequented regularly for Sunday lunch. Not been back since it became Long Island Exchange - yet another American style eaterie for the younger generations. When/where will it all end? Bring back the "Vic" (no, not that one) and the Cassiobury Park Gates whilst we're at it.......

<p> If it's a choice between the hotel or the Chief Exec, I know which one I would keep.
<p> We pay his wages, I suggest we stop doing that.

<p> Sounds like council chief executive Steven Halls has "predetermined" his decision if demolishing the hotel would make him "happy". He needs to be removed from any decision making process too.

<p> it seems to me like the chief executive is for some reason going to railroad this developement through no matter what the residents who pay his salary think ! by removing an elected councilllor from voting or from the discussion process is absolutely disgusting and flys in the face of democracy and sticks two fingers up to TRDC residents, silencing councillors is not the thing to do. If he does suceed in silencing councillor hiscocks i believe TRDC residents should seek for the chief executives resignation!

<p> So it's been on the LDF for 3 years and nobody thought to do anything about this, for example get the building listed?
<p> The place is run down and hardly beloved by many. No wonder the owners have flogged it off to be knocked down rather than as a going concern!

<p> You can see the proposed development on our blogspot: http://savelongislan d.blogspot.com. It would be an understatement to say that it really isn't in keeping with the surrounding area! Interestingly, despite the lack of investment in the hotel, it is still running at almost full capacity most of the time.
