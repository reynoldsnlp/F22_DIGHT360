<p> In a nutshell,  The overt business benefit of attending a Mastermind should be a 30% increase in profits within the year  The reason to believe a group will do it for you is its track record  What makes those I am talking about so very different is the fact they have been run for some twenty years in various guises and constantly deliver.
<p> In order to avoid paying a premium price for attending a fully-fledged mastermind group, people try to run their own groups. The apparent upside is obvious - it will be cheap; the downside is less obvious at first. The reality is that such a 'less expensive programme':  Isn't run by a professional with a clear process for growing a business or a clear process for facilitating a mastermind group  Doesn't have enough tried-and-tested processes in place; things are made up as it goes along (AKA "real-time R&D")  Doesn't tie people in through a financial commitment  Doesn't create huge expectations  Tends towards being a social event if the results-focus wanes.
<p> On the other hand, a high price point anticipates a high-quality offering that delivers on the promise. The high price point keeps the following out of the room:  Cheapskates  Free-loaders  Basket cases
<p> A premium price attracts people who:  look for like-minded and ambitious people  are able to afford to invest (time and money) in the growth of their business  are looking for support from experts and colleagues  want to be working with an 'expert' is their field using a tested, proven process and 'ology'  are looking for space to o think strategically o talk through specific issues o have their feet held to the fire.
<p> So, the price point goes some way to creating a self-selecting group of ambitious business owners and directors.
<p> But what do they get? Well, I can only talk about my experience as a mastermind delegate and from running my own groups for the last 20 years.
<p> The list of 'soft' benefits goes as follows:  an incredibly supportive and proactive group of like-minded business owners determined to help you grow your business  a mastermind expert, an acknowledged expert in their field (author, keynote speaker, been-there-done-it individual) who also has the facilitation and motivating skills to turbo-charge your thinking  access to the network and 'black book' of the expert and your mastermind colleagues putting you in contact with potential suppliers and JVs  access to a tight and loyal 'team' or 'club' who will have experience of dealing with issues that are challenging you  new sales, referrals, recommendations  a better business from implementing processes and systems that roll out of your boardroom and through the business  the confidence to make tough(er) decisions and to follow them through.
<p> Long term, the benefits can be seen by looking at a group I worked with 10 years ago and seeing the results for that group.
<p> The 10 businesses were turning over just under 1.3 million (on average) back at the start of the decade. Some ten years later all are still in business (in some form) and the average turnover is now 15 million. More significantly, profit grew a staggering thirtyfold in the time period.
<p> On average, the long-term performance of these businesses has more than outperformed the market. Maybe the programme just attracts high-performers.
<p> Anyhow, what we can say is that those who choose to attend such programmes achieve above-average performance.
<h> For & Against Paying For A Proper Mastermind Group...
<p> It's understandable that you should dismiss "free" mastermind groups in favour of premium-priced ones based on your experience and your business model. However, I feel you have presented just one view. Allow me to put forward another.
<p> In a profession I know well - the world of professional speaking - most of the 6,000 global practitioners are in one or more mastermind groups. None of us pays. My experience of a mastermind group is that it is the single most important factor driving my business forward. Each year, I have increased my turnover by more than 50%, driven largely by the support of my mastermind group.
<p> Of course, such groups are not really "free". In my group, we each commit four two-day sessions each year, plus travel to each others locations, since we happen to be based all over the UK. We follow-up over Skype. We hold each other accountable. We refer work to each other, and most importantly, we're close friends. The social aspect is crucial, in my view.
<p> I have no doubt that your premium model works, since I've spoken to many people who have benefited from it. But it's not the only model.
<h> For & Against Paying For A Proper Mastermind Group...
<p> It is not the only model and if you can get a free/less expensive model to work then fantastic.
<p> In the past I have been part of free-type groups but the commitment to the process and to each other has often been uneven. When people pay then they expect to get a service and a benefit to match the price. Also it does weed out the tyre-kickers...
<p> So, yes it is definitely not the only model that works. Sorry if it came across that way..
<h> For & Against Paying For A Proper Mastermind Group...
<p> Great question In Alan's case - its a culture/ habit thing where there is an expectation both to outsiders and those already inside. In my experience in this area, where the group is smaller and not a part of a greater whole, success is more limited.
<p> Having some "skin in the game" does "tip the balance" towards sustainability and success, in my experience. Often the same for Joint Ventures - if there is not a risk & reward to both parties, often there is no success!
<h> For & Against Paying For A Proper Mastermind Group...
<p> Mike That was the phrase I was searching for... "Having some "skin in the game" does "tip the balance" towards sustainability and success," Have you thought of writing other people's comments for them....
<h> Premium = Cost versus value
<p> If they aren't paying, then they don't get the value proposition is my starter for ten.
<p> Also would suggest that times is hard and a premium product is now out of the reach for some. I would reduce the price until there were enough people in the group until times get easier then up the price.
<p> We all want more for less, those that do not react to this pressure are deluding themeslves
<h> Premium = Cost versus value
<p> Are you saying that the only measure of value is money, and if someone doesn't use money as the measure then they don't 'get' the value proposition?
<p> If that is the case and the reaction to tough times is to drop the price then the economy goes into a spiral where the amount of money falls for everyone, times get tougher, and the price has to fall again, that is, at least, until the price falls to nothing at which point they won't 'get' the value proposition.
<p> Now I admit I'm using a logical argument here called Reductio Ad Absurdam, used to make the point and there are flaws in that logic, so I'm not hanging my hat on the conclusion, just painting a picture.
<p> Firstly there are plenty of things where people get the value without paying, the value of love is always without the cost of money as a requirement for example.
<p> In tough times it may be worth sponsoring membership of a mastermind group for someone to help them acheive what they should acheive. Through Abelard I've done this for a couple of people for example.
<p> Instead of cutting the price, some groups add short term additional support for those who are struggling financially to help them get to the point of financial strength again.
<p> The key to the value of a Mastermind group is a mutual shared purpose allied to commitment. Alan's group has this in spades and doesn't need to pay for membership directly (although all the members meet their own costs, so it's not free) For others the premium provides organisation, shared purpose and a measure of value. Cut the price, and, if it is a measure of value, then you cut the perceived value, and devalue the commitment, rather than make it more accessible.
