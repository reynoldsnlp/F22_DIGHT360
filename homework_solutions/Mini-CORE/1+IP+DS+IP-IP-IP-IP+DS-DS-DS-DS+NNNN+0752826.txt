<h> Review
<p> "...this is still the most comprehensive treatise on process safety and loss prevention available... it should be in the process safety department library of any company involved with manufacturing handling, and processing hazardous chemicals. Also, process safety/loss prevention specialists and consultants will find it an invaluable source book on practically every subject in this field." - CCPS Journal
