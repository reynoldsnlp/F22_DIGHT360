<p> (I?ve heard it all before And love is a two-way street You have to give something to this relationship I?m all out of understanding It?s always something with you And all I?ve got to say is)
<p> Gave you the best, best years of my life And I gave you a woman who stood by your side Through all your ups and downs Your rights and all your wrongs And God knows there were wrongs I should have been long gone
<p> But when I made you that promise For better or worse I said I?d stay by your side I swallow my pride And now you?re asking me to understand And I?m telling you I can?t Why should I care about your feelings When you don?t give a damn about mine
<p> Well I don?t want to know I couldn?t care less about your feelings Don?t you know you should have cared more about mine And I don?t want to know It really doesn?t matter why you?re leaving You should know you?re really throwing away your life And I won?t sympathise You hurt me for the last time Got no tears left to cry
<p> Baby, gave you three hearts One boy and one girl And a, a woman who loves you We?re sitting here falling apart All through your ins and outs Your fears and all your doubts God knows there?ve been doubts But we?ve given you a home [ From : http://www.elyrics.net/read/g/gladys-kni\\... ] And you?re just throwing it away, baby All for some girl born yesterday And what about your children There?s nothing to explain But still you?re asking us to understand Well I?m telling you we can?t Why should we care about your reasons When you?re walking right out of our lives
<p> Said I don?t want to know I couldn?t care less about your feelings Don?t you know you should have cared more about mine And I don?t want to know It really doesn?t matter why you?re leaving You should know you?re really throwing away your life And I won?t sympathise You hurt me for the last time Got no tears left to cry
<p> Say goodbye to all the loving memories, yeah One last time, one good look at all the love That won?t be in your life Say goodbye, I hope that you?ll be happy Don?t look back, cos it?ll be too late I?m going on with my life
<p> And I don?t want to know I couldn?t care less about your feelings Oh, don?t you know you should have cared more ?bout mine And I don?t want to know It really doesn?t matter why you?re leaving You, you should know you?re really throwing away your life And I won?t, I won?t, I won?t sympathise You hurt me, hurt me, hurt me for the last time Got no tears left to cry, no, no
