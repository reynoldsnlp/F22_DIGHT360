<h> One Of Them Weeks Lyrics
<p> Things are tough all over on planet earth The folks are getting psyched for an immaculate birth We love a good story but good don?t sell I saw Jesus leavin? town like a bat out of hell
<p> Well a war?ll come along an? make the young guns fight So everyone can sleep tight in their beds at night A million dreams floating up that creek I guess it means it?s gonna be one of them weeks Such a good week to be asleep ? one of them weeks.
<p> Darwin?s law, strong and weak, Gadgets and gizmos to muzzle up the meek gotta muffle up the meek Mother Nature?s inheritance is looking b-l-e-a-k better keep your tongue in your cheek ? one of them weeks [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/buck+deanne\\... ] 2nd time: Yes it means it?s gonna be one of them weeks. 3rd time: Guess it means it?s gonna be one of them weeks.
<p> For a little while-there-life was a cabaret Then it turned into the picture of Dorian Grey Now peace and good will?s playing hide and seek Guess it means it?s gonna be one of them weeks better keep your tongue in your cheek ? one of them weeks
<p> Neighbour?s got a black cat bone on his door Gran-ma?s stashing cash beneath the kitchen floor Kid?s sweeping the street for communication leaks I guess it means it?s gonna be one of them weeks better keep your tongue in your cheek ? one of them weeks Yes it means it?s gonna be one of them weeks Such a good week to be asleep ? one of them weeks.
