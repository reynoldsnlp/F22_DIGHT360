<h> I Want To (Do Everything For You) lyrics
<h> Joe Tex I Want To (Do Everything For You) lyrics
<p> I want to hold you in my arms Till you say turn you lose. I want to do the things for you Till you say it aint no use. I want to wake you every morning With a good morning kiss. I want to kiss you to sleep the same way Cause I know you like this. I want to do everything for you Cause that's all that man can do When he loves a woman like I love you. And I love ya, love ya I love ya, love ya, love ya, I love ya, love ya... love ya Ooo... eee, yes I love you. [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joe_t\\... ] I want to say sweet things to you Till you say I said enough. I want to stand right by your side When the goin gets tough. I want to mend your broken heart Till you say the hurt is gone. I want to stay with you always So that you wont be alone. I want to do everything for you Cause that's all that man can do When he loves a woman like I love you. And I love ya, love ya, love ya Love ya, love ya... love ya Ooo... eee... like I love you.
<p> I want to work for you every day Till you say come home and rest. I want to buy you pretty things So you can look your best. I want to take you everywhere So the world can see what I got. I want to treat you with tender love Till you say I've got to stop. I want to do everything for you Cause that's all that man can do When he loves a woman like I love you. And I love ya love ya, love ya, love ya Yes, I love ya, love ya Love ya
