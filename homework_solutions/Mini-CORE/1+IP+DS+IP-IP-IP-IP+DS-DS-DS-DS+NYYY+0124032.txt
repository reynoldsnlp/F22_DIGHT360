<h> Editorial Reviews
<h> From School Library Journal
<p> Grade 4-8. These short stories affirm the ability of their main characters to choose their fate. In the title story, Willie bravely searches for the cure for unhappiness. It, and the other stories, show readers the resilience and power of kids using their eyes and minds over accepting conventional adult wisdom. In "Pets," Eve comes up with a solution to the ghost cats who want her to join them, even though she is desperately ill. In "Teacher Tamer," Gregory sneaks into the house of his teacher to seek revenge for her persecution of him; instead, he comes to understand her. Whether facing a domineering mother, divorced parents, or a reputation as a bad guy, the protagonists take positive steps forward. It is this constant of taking action, of choosing the halo over the pitchfork, that make these stories inspiring. Some characters are crass and brash; others are introspective and quiet. Danger lurks in guns, ghosts, strangers, and unjust adults. It's a rare treat to be so surprised so consistently in a collection of stories that still adheres to its theme. Unpredictable and fun, these selections stand out for their inventiveness in dealing with difficult issues in a positive way without sacrificing the honest voices of real kids.?Carol A.

<h> More About the Author
<p> More info at avi-writer.com and facebook.com/avi.writer ----------------------------------------\\... Avi is part of a family of writers extending back into the 19th century. Born in 1937 and raised in New York City, Avi was educated in local schools, before going to the Midwest and then back to NYC to complete his education. Starting out as a playwright--while working for many years as a librarian--he began writing books for young people when the first of his kids came along.
<p> His first book was Things That Sometimes Happen, published in 1970, and recently reissued. Since then he has published seventy books. Winner of many awards, including the 2003 Newbery award for Crispin: the Cross of Lead (Hyperion), two Newbery Honors, two Horn Book awards, and an O'Dell award, as well as many children's choice awards, he frequently travels to schools around the country to talk to his readers.
<p> Among his most popular books are Crispin: The Cross of Lead, The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, Nothing but the Truth, the Poppy books, Midnight Magic, and The Fighting Ground.
<p> In 2008 he published The Seer of Shadows (HarperCollins), A Beginning a Muddle and an End (Harcourt), Hard Gold (Hyperion) and Not Seeing is Believing, a one-act play in the collection, Acting Out (Simon and Schuster). Crispin: the End of Time, the third in the Newbery Award-winning series, was published in 2010. City of Orphans was released in 2011, receiving a number of starred reviews.

<p> Even though the age range for this book is grades 5-8,Avi has written a collection of short stories that can be enjoyed by students of any age, up to and including high school. From the boy who wants to express his feelings to his parents, but needs them to be "captive" at a restaurant in order to make that happen, to the boy who asks questions with no answers, the characters in this collection are likable, searching, and very much wanting to do the right thing. I would highly recommend this book to English teachers who may be looking for a book of short stories to recommend to their students.
<p> In What Do Fish Have To Do With Anything?: And Other Stories, you always learn your lesson. From kindness to caring, Avi tells 7 tales of mystery and friendship. This book is funny and suspenseful, you never know what will happen next. While you're reading this book, you can tell how the characters are feeling at all times. If I had written this book, nothing would be changed. I recommend this book to children ages 10-13. Remember, like the stranger across the street said, you always need more than what they say.
<p> Written in the signature Avi methond, this book is about lots of subjects. Homeless People, Suicide, Ghosts, Divorce, Teachers and alot more. Avi keeps it real, making the things about events that do happen in 5th/6th/7th grades. I recomend this to anyone who enjous short stories or who like Avi's stranger stories.
