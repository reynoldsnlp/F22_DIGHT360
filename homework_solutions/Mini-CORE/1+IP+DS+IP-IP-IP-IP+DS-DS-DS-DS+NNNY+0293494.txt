<p> Shaun, the clever little sheep from Nick Park's Oscar-winning short A Close Shave (1995), returns for more stop-motion fun in Back in the Ba-a-ath . While the nearsighted and none-too-bright Farmer is away, Shaun and his flock-mates explore their surrounding and get into mischief. When the water in the sheep-dip tank proves too cold for comfort (it freezes a duck solid), Shaun and company devise an elaborate scheme to steal the Farmer's hot bathwater. Shaun also has to design a workout routine for a sheep who's gotten too fat to get through the barn door. Whenever the Farmer can see them, they act like ordinary sheep under the watchful eye of Bitzer the sheepdog, which adds to the fun. Although the animation is much less polished than in Park's ground-breaking film, the artists include some deft touches that bring the characters to life. Warm, charming, and funny, the Shaun the Sheep cartoons will delight small children--and their parents. (Unrated, suitable for all ages: minor cartoon violence) --Charles Solomon
<h> Product Description
<p> Have fun with Shaun the Sheep and the wacky animal antics from the Oscar(r)-winning creators of Wallace & Gromit. With Shaun, Bitzer the sheepdog and those Naughty Pigs next door, there's no telling what bizarre escapades will happen next as the animals pull the wool over The Farmer's eyes. From stealing hot water for their own bath to ordering pizza for the barnyard, sometimes it's shear madness, but it's always fleecy fun!
<p> We first saw Shaun the Sheep on Disney and our son (one year old at the time) loved it so much we bought the DVD set from Amazon UK and a Region Free DVD player just so he could watch it. He's almost 2 1/2 now and still loves it. He recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!
<p> We stumbled onto "off the baa" and got it for Christmas. Our family is big Wallace & Gromit fans and we were not disappointed by this DVD. So we have been eagerly awaiting the second installment. We ordered serveral copies and another copy of the Wallace and Gromit collection. Amazon claimed 5 to 7 days shipping, actual shipping time 11 days according to tracking info. We would have gladly paid for shipping to get this in a reasonable amount of time. 11 days is way to long.
<p> I purchased the first Shaun the Sheep DVD (Off the Baa!) sight unseen because my husband and son are huge fans of Aardman Studios' "Wallace and Gromit" movies - Shaun makes an appearance in the short, "A Close Shave." Well, I'm glad I did. The Shaun the Sheep episodes are hilarious! There isn't any dialogue but it's not needed. The situations the characters find themselves in will keep you chuckling from beginning to end. This second DVD is as good as the first and we look forward to getting the other DVDs as they come out.
