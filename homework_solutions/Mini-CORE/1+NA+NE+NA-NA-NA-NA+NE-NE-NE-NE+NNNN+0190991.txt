<p> ANDREW FRANCIS WALLACE/TORONTO STAR Christopher Quigley walks near the University Ave. courthouse after a morning of testifying at the trial of former Toronto drug squad officers changed with various offences including obstruction of justice, perjury, assault and extortion related to their work between 1997 and 2002. Quigley, 46, testified that in the spring of 1998 drug squad officers kicked, punched and choked him to the point of unconsciousness as they demanded the whereabouts of his drugs and money.

<p> A former pot dealer who claims drug squad detectives "tortured" him over nine hours adamantly denies his injuries were minimal or occurred after he went berserk.
<p> In a dramatic and combative exchange with defence lawyer John Rosen, star Crown witness Christopher Quigley angrily fended off suggestions he is exaggerating his injuries because he has an "agenda."
<p> "You have your agenda and I have mine," Quigley said at a Toronto police corruption trial. "And that's to tell the truth."
<p> Rosen went over hospital records and suggested they don't back up Quigley's claim that in the spring of 1998 he was viciously kicked, punched and choked in a police interview room to the point he thought he was going to die.
<p> "There was nothing wrong with your head," said Rosen, lawyer for former detective John Schertzer, head of Team 3 of Central Field Command drug squad.
<p> "There was quite a bit wrong with my head," Quigley shot back. "I had a huge gash that required stitches. I had a massive amount of injuries done to me while I was in that room, sir."
<p> Rosen suggested Quigley got the head cut when he "went berserk" upon learning detectives were going to open a safety deposit box where he stashed his cash, and that he had to be restrained after he attacked an officer.
<p> "That is the biggest lie," Quigley replied. "That never happened, and we both know it."
<p> The former Team 3 officers collectively face 29 charges, laid in January 2004, including attempt to obstruct justice, perjury, assault and extortion related to events between 1997 and 2002.
<p> Quigley has testified he was covered in blood after the beating, and when he was taken to the cells a shocked uniformed officer screamed for an ambulance.
<p> But Rosen pointed out that the ambulance didn't arrive until 90 minutes later.
<p> Rosen also noted Quigley was released from Sunnybrook hospital after some seven hours.
<p> Dramatic pictures of his injuries that Quigley had his girlfriend take of him the following day are calculated to show him when his bruises looked their worst -- several hours after being inflicted, Rosen suggested.
<p> And there is no hospital record of a nasty arm puncture wound shown in one of Quigley's home photos, proving it was not inflicted during police custody, Rosen said.
