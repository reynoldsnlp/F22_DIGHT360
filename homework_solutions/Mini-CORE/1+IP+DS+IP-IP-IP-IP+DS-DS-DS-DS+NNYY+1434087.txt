<h> Book Description
<p> We design to elicit responses from people. We want them to buy something, read more, or take action of some kind. Designing without understanding what makes people act the way they do is like exploring a new city without a map: results will be haphazard, confusing, and inefficient. This book combines real science and research with practical examples to deliver a guide every designer needs. With it you'll be able to design more intuitive and engaging work for print, websites, applications, and products that matches the way people think, work, and play.
<p> Learn to increase the effectiveness, conversion rates, and usability of your own design projects by finding the answers to questions such as:
<p> What grabs and holds attention on a page or screen?
<p> What makes memories stick?
<p> What is more important, peripheral or central vision?
<p> How can you predict the types of errors that people will make?
<p> What is the limit to someone's social circle?
<p> How do you motivate people to continue on to (the next step?
<p> What line length for text is best?
<p> Are some fonts better than others?
<p> These are just a few of the questions that the book answers in its deep-dive exploration of what makes people tick.

<h> More About the Author
<h> Product Description
<h> About the Author
<p> Susan Weinschenk has a Ph.D. in Psychology, and a 30-year career in applying psychology to the design of technology. She has written several books on user-centered design. Her 2008 book, Neuro Web Design: What makes them click?, published by New Riders, applies the research on neuroscience to the design of web sites. A popular speaker and presenter, her nickname is "The Brain Lady". She is Chief of User Experience Strategy, Americas, at Human Factors International, and runs a popular blog: Whatmakesthemclick.net.
<p> Fantastic book capturing really useful research on how people interact, what motivates them, and how to refine and optimise user experience. Loaded with practical tips on putting the research into action!
<p> This book is a must for every designer, marketing or advertising professional. If you are commissioning design, to be forewarned, is to be forearmed. This book is both evolutionary and revolutionary. It is becoming harder, to find, engage and retain customers. It is even harder, if you fail to grasp the fundamental aspects of psychology, design and human behaviour.
<p> This book is really a Pavlonian dictionary for people. Master the techniques, Susan has illustrated and your customers, clients and prospects, will be entertained as much as engaged and that is surely what we all aiming for.
<p> This appealing short book brings together little nuggets of psychology, which the author makes immediately relevant to design decisions.
<p> It's simply and clearly written. You can choose whether to read it straight through, focus on just one of the 10 sections, or simply pick out a single item of the 100. Each one is: - self-contained, - described with an example, - supported by appropriate research, and - finishes with one or more 'Takeaways' that you can use immediately.
<p> I have been waiting for a book like this for so many years now. I think with every profession there are certain ideas that are taken for granted and, over the decades, become "fact" for practitioners. But just because research showed something 40 years ago doesn't mean that study was well done, or correct, in the first place. The strength of this book is that the author cites more recent research about principles you either thought you knew, and were wrong, or that you thought you knew, and are still right. I feel a certain sense of liberation reading a book like this, because if you cannot challenge your closely held beliefs, what kind of professional are you?
<p> The structure is terrifically usable: one hundred "chapters" that are often only 1 or 2 pages long. In a book like this, the references are as valuable as the author's own writing. I can look up the sources and make up my own mind if I have any questions. But most of the time, I appreciate the author's explanations of the book's segments: * How people see * How people read * How people remember * How people think * How people focus their attention * What motivates people * People are social animals * How people feel * People make mistakes * How people decide.
<p> Amidst all the success of the book is some occasional lack of proofreading on the editor's part. This is not the author's fault, but I do think the editor was not up to the task. But that does not inhibit the usefulness of the book. It is dense, yet concise. A really good reference to keep on the shelf at one's desk, no matter what research and design projects one works on.
<p> I was hoping that this book would be a great complement to the classic "Don't Make Me Think!" (which has stood the test of time).
<p> While I do find all of the studies & facts cited to be certainly interesting, not very many of them necessarily lead to actionable results. For example, she'll talk about the importance of peripheral vision, but I would have liked more "AND SO THIS IS WHAT THIS MEANS" added. That is, it's great to know that people process images / words in certain ways, but the information provided is either 1) obvious ("people are social animals" -- oh really? I hadn't noticed) or a 2) bit vague. I realize that much in design is subjective and so you can't make absolute statements, but still...it just doesn't feel substantive enough for me.
<p> Thankfully, I've kept my copy pristine and will be selling it back to Amazon (unlike Krug's book, which I refer to frequently). Cheers!
