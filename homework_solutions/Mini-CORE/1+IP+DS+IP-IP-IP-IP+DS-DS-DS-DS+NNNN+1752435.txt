<h> About the Author
<p> J.D. Robb is the pseudonym for a number one "New York Times" bestselling author of more than 190 novels, including the futuristic suspense In Death series. There are more than 400 million copies of her books in print.
<p> New York Times bestselling author Patricia Gaffney is a six-time Rita nominee for her historical romances, and winner of the Romance Writers of America's Golden Heart award. She worked as a high school English teacher and a court reporter before pursuing a full-time career as a novelist. Ms. Gaffney lives in southern Pennsylvania with her husband.
<p> There are 5 short stories in this book. I personally enjoyed the last two stories the most: Mary Kay McComas writes about an old house which is haunted by three women who have not been able to move on. Ruth Ryan Langdon's story is about a con artist who ends up killing rich people to take their money. The other 3 stories: JD Robb writes about a Lieutenant who is possessed by a dead woman in order to find her daughter who is in danger of being murdered. Mary Blayney's story is about a couple who get to find out what it is like to live in their wife/husbands body for a short period of time. Patricia Gaffney writes about a supposedly haunted house that is on the market but is not really meant to be sold.
