<h> Can't Wait To See You Lyrics
<p> Day after day, I'd love to say it Time and again, I'd love to say it Just when you need it the mo-ost There's something you wanted to hear Yes, just when you need me the most (ah-hah) I'll be waiting for you
<p> I (I) - can't wait to see you I (I) - can't wait to see you-ou
<p> Night after night - I wish for nothin' Dream after dream - nothin' but somethin' Just when you need it the mo-ost There's something you wanted to hear Yes, just when you need me the most (ah-hah) I'll be waiting for you
<p> I, I can't, no I can't wait, can't wait to see you I, I can't, no I can't wait, can't wait to see you-ou (ooh-ooh-hooh)
<p> Count up to three, oh-oh-hoh Waitin' for me, oh-oh-hoh I just can't wait, (no-oh-no) wait to see you
<p> Just when you need it the most (day after day) There's something you wanted to hear (I love to say it) Yes, just when you need me the most (time and again) Ah hah, I'll be waiting for you (I love to say it)
<p> (Ooh-ooh-hoh) Count up to three, ooh-ooh-hooh Waiting for me, hey-ey-hey I just can't wait, (no-oh-no) wait to see you
<p> I can't, I can't wait to see you (can't wait to see you) I can't, I can't wait to see you (can't wait to see you-ou) I can't, I can't wait to see you (can't wait to see you-ou-ou) I can't, I can't (can't wait to see you, can't wait to see you-ou) I can't, I can't wait to see you (can't wait to see you-ou) I can't, I can't wait [fade] [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/eurogliders\\... ]
