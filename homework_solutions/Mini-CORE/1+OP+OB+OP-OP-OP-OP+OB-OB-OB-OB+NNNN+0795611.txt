<h> Outsmarting a Chicago Smarty at His Own Game
<p> It's a week since the 2012 election, and personally, I'm totally disoriented.  I mistook Friday for Wednesday; I live on an island destroyed by hurricane Sandy; and my overall mood borders on despondent.  For me, anyway, it's depressing that left-wing academes, women in vagina suits, illegal aliens, liberal progressives, 85% of all Muslims living in America, and Hugo Chvez, Vladimir Putin, Fidel Castro, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are all equally ecstatic about the re-election of Barack Obama.
<p> While disconcerting to most, those types of accolades have not been wasted on the president.  He has mistaken a non-mandate for a mandate and is wasting zero time frenetically fast-tracking policies guaranteed to further limit the constitutional freedoms of every American, including those who were twirling around like Deadheads after the November 6 election was called.
<p> And even though the Republicans retained control of the House, in the bleakness and disappointment that remains, there seems to be little hope left for those who thought the election would turn out differently.
<p> The truth is that while the last vestiges of freedom hinge directly on state representatives who attest to conservative principles, hearing Barry's favorite golf partner John Boehner saying that ObamaCare is now "the law of the land" has made many, including myself, want to throw ourselves off that "fiscal cliff" that's currently the topic of alarmed discussion.
<p> On the day following the election, Speaker Boehner politely acquiesced to the effect that the people's choice indicates that indeed this is Barack Obama's " moment ."  However, Boehner did maintain that while he's committed to assisting the president in reining in entitlement programs and is anxious to support serious spending cuts, Congress is not open to punishing small business owners -- i.e., " the rich " -- with tax increases.
<p> Sorry, but John Boehner feigning bravado coupled with Barack Obama's self-assured swaggering has only added to the pervading depression that has gripped half the country.  What America is currently being subjected to by Barack Obama is the same " I won " attitude he had in 2009 when he proposed and implemented his failed $787-billion stimulus package.
<p> Nonetheless, John Boehner has encouraged the president to take the lead.  Yet for the sake of the future of America, at this juncture, John is the one who should be doing the leading.
<p> Instead of immediately extending an olive branch, what the speaker of the House should recognize is that he's the one who holds the power when it comes to everything the cocksure Obama believes he now controls.  If Mr. Boehner spent more time paying attention and less time at the tanning salon, he might realize that the key to hamstringing Barack Obama's goals is to outsmart a Chicago smarty at his own game.
<p> How?  Well, before election week ended, the retired four-star general/civilian CIA director General David Petraeus admitted to an extramarital affair and promptly stepped down.  Petraeus's shocking resignation took place one week prior to being compelled to testify before Congress about the seven-hour terrorist attack on the Libyan consulate in Benghazi that took the lives of four Americans on the anniversary of September 11.
<p> As a group, most Obama voters have proven to be generally oblivious to the more serious issues facing America's future.  Perhaps David Petraeus's suspiciously timed resignation will be the thing that finally captures the attention of those who, thus far, have been more concerned with Big Bird and birth control than an American ambassador being raped, tortured, and killed.
<p> Therefore, instead of allowing the haughty Barack Obama to continue calling the shots, House Republicans could use General Petraeus's resignation as a catalyst to wrest control from the president and place it back into the hands of the American people.
<p> To do so, it would be necessary for congressional Republicans to muster up the temerity to use the Benghazi cover-up as clout; then, once they're hit in the paycheck, even those who supported the foolishly reelected Two-Term Terminator will be demanding answers about what went down in Libya.
<p> In lieu of Petraeus's testimony, the first step would be for Republicans to promptly petition the White House to hand over all correspondence relating to the Benghazi event.  John Boehner could then demand pertinent evidence including e-mails and videos from the Situation Room, from which place the terrorist attack was taped as it unfolded in real time.  If Barack Obama and his minions choose to continue to stonewall, the speaker will be justified in countering the president's refusal by publicly refusing to comply with budgetary negotiations, including discussions about tax cuts, rates, and revenue.
<p> If Mr. Boehner manages to effectively utilize the incident in Benghazi for political leverage and the nation subsequently careens forward over the "fiscal cliff," the president can then be held accountable.  Moreover, Boehner will at least have a fighting chance to make the argument that the nation's economic woes are a result of the White House refusing to come clean.
<p> In other words, if, on behalf of the American people, Republicans in Congress suck it up and grasp the optimal set of circumstances currently before them, then, caught between a "fiscal cliff" and Benghazi, Barack Obama will be the one doing the surrendering, not the other way around.
