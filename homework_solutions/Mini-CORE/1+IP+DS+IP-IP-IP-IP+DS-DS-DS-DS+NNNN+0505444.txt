<p> Is it the voice or the content of the jokes? Either way, this is one hillarious CD. The deadpan nature of his delivery turns incredibly simple jokes into some of the most fresh and funny material you'll ever hear.
<p> I first bought the tape nearly ten years ago, and laughed hysterically then. Now, a decade later, the material is still as relevant and funny as ever. The key to good comedy is making the material relevant to the audience, by discussing subject matter to which everyone can relate. Steven Wright finds a way to do this with some of the the most outlandish subject matter you'll ever hear, (ie. elevators in the middle of the desert, poison ivy of the brain, a pony in his apartment) - all the while making you think "It's so simple - why didn't I think of that?"
<p> With the exception of a few sexual references (nothing explicit) - the material is very clean. No swearing at all!
<p> This is not the kind of comedy CD you'll listen to once, then put aside and forget about. There are so many jokes, you could never remember all of them - so every listen is almost like the first. This CD is well worth the purchase.
<p> "Rachel got poison ivy on her brain. The only way she can scratch it is to think about sandpaper."
<p> "I bought some batteries, but they weren't included."
<p> "I parked in a tow-away zone, and when I got back the entire area was gone."
<p> "I lost a buttonhole."
<p> "Right now I'm having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time."
<p> "I have an enormous sea-shell collection. I keep it scattered on beaches all over the world. Perhaps you've seen it."
<p> "I want to get a tattoo over my entire body of myself, only an inch taller."
<p> "But the sign says 'Open 24 Hours.'" "Not in a row."
<p> "You know when you're leaning back in a chair and then you lean way back and you're just on two legs and then you lean just a little far and you almost fall but at the last minute you catch yourself? I feel like that all the time."
<p> IMPORT? This isn't available in the U.S. anymore! And yet Adam Sandler is a megastar...
<p> And another thing: why doesn't Amazon have a "comedy" category under the CD/tape section?
<p> Steven Wrights comedy is so cerebral that any person, with a frontal lobe, should appreciate it. With classic jokes like, " Last week I spilled spot remover on my dog..... Now I can't find him" and "I have the ability to levetate birds... but no one cares," everyone in the listening radius should be rolling on the ground. Steven Wright is a master of dead-pan and no one will ever superceed his prowess. Truly a perfect album for anyone who loves to laugh.
