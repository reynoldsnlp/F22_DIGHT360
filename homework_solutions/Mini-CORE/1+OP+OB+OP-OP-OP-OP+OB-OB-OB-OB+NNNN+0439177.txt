<h> Villains don't have to be sympathetic, but they do have to be compelling
<p> Villains don't have to be sympathetic. They just have to be compelling.
<p> True, a sympathetic villain can be compelling; in fact, in many cases, just being sympathetic is compelling enough. When a villain is trying to right some unjust wrong, trying to take revenge on those who hurt the people the villain cares about, or otherwise attempting to accomplish something fundamentally good (even through wicked means), there's audience interest.
<p> But not every villain needs to tug at your heartstrings. Chronicle 's villain -- his name is a spoiler, so I'm not dropping it -- isn't terribly sympathetic, but IS compelling. What he does with power, power he's never had -- power his friends have seemingly unrelated but, on closer inspection, relevant experience with -- is the cornerstone of the film's tension. His motivations, why he does what he does; they aren't sympathetic but ARE interesting nonetheless.
<p> Compelling villains are not necessarily sympathetic but are always better than uninteresting ones.
<p> EDIT -- As was pointed out by a Google+ friend (thank you Chris), a villain must also be effective at handling the hero. An incompetent antagonist that presents no threat is immediately uninteresting by virtue of being unable to suitably challenge the protagonist (whether the challenge is physical, mental, or some mix of both). That villain may, however, be a suitable antagonist for someone else... or perhaps better suited as a hero! Experiment.
