<p> Even though Samsung lost their patent suit against Apple in the United States, the cards seem to be stacked against Apple in other markets. That South Korea ruled in favor of Samsung could be considered like a normal turn of events, but lately a court in the United Kingdom and now one in The Netherlands have ruled in Samsung's favor, much to their delight.
<p> In this specific case, Apple claimed that Samsung phones violated their patent of multi-touch functions. Using two fingers to zoom in on a picture (with the famous "pinch" motion) and for other functions was though to be exclusive by Apple, and they understood that Samsung was in breach of copyright laws. This was similar to other court cases around the world, where Apple sued Samsung for a variety of reasons, from operating system functions like this one to issues of exterior/cosmetic design.
<p> Like we said, things were going well for Apple when they beat Samsung in their US court battle. But now it all seems to be slipping as more courts in Europe decide that Samsung was not in a breach of patent after all. And this is a problem for Apple, since European law commonly dictates that if a decision is made within one court of law in the European Union, it stands in all other countries. Apple may still try to appeal this, but it is beginning to look like a losing battle for the American company.
