<h> When Our Love Passed Out On The Couch Lyrics - X
<p> make out when you passed out on the sofa kissing any little child that comes along i'm gonna leave on the record too loud for you to hear me spreading technicolor blood i hate it i love you i hate that i need to know what you do when our love passed out on the couch you're fateful i'm hateful and i ruin any kind of fun you have in mind like make out when you pass out on the sofa kissing any little child who comes along
