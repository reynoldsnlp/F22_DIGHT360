<h> The Man Behind the Conversion: VP for Commercial Engineering at Helix Well Ops
<p> Earlier this year Helix Energy Solutions Group announced it was acquiring a drillship to be converted into a well intervention vessel and re-named her the Helix 534 , referencing the vessel's length of 534 feet. The Helix 534 is expected to enter service mid-2013 and will be operated by our well intervention business unit, Helix Well Ops. Overseeing the conversion process is Helix ESG's Vice President for Commercial Engineering, Colin Johnston.
<p> Mr. Johnston has 10 years of experience in subsea well intervention operations with Helix ESG, including the launching of the Q4000 . Prior to joining Helix ESG, Mr. Johnston spent a decade working on other well intervention projects in the North Sea, Europe and in North America. Mr. Johnston has a BSC in Mining Engineering from the University of Newcastle and a master's degree in Subsea Engineering from Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland and an MBA in Finance from the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas.
<p> 1. What is your role and what are your day to day duties concerning one of Helix Energy Solutions Group's newest assets, the Helix 534?
<p> As Vice President for Commercial Engineering my role is to ensure that the requirements from operations are met in terms of the equipment delivery and applicability.  With regard to the Helix 534, the key elements of the vessel's conversion are the modifications to eliminate the obsolete drilling equipment and to ensure the vessel is configured for efficient well intervention operations. In addition, I will keep a close watch on the economics and business case to ensure that the client is receiving what they require.
<p> 2.       What kinds of intervention capabilities will the Helix 534 have once she is operational and what class of vessel will the Helix 534 be once the conversion is completed?
<p> When operational the Helix 534 will, at first glance, appear as she always has, however she will be equipped with a full intervention riser system and thus be capable of full through tubing intervention operations. Her status as a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) will be maintained and her top hole drilling capability will remain.
<p> 3. When converting a vessel like a drill ship into a well intervention vessel, what are some of the biggest challenges encountered?
<p> When operating as a drill ship the vessel is expected to remain on location for long periods and perform the well construction process. As a well intervention vessel, the mobilization, location set up, operations and demobilization process typically lasts for 14 to 21 days. Thus the efficiency of handling well services equipment and the ability to be operationally ready in short period of time are key. The emphasis is on making the vessel more well services friendly in terms of equipment handling and also adding multiple levels of operational activity such as well interface preparation at the same time as well service equipment rig up and testing.
<p> 4.       What are the differences between monohull well intervention vessels and semisubmersibles in regards to the kinds of operations they are capable of?
<p> The differences between monohull and semi-submersible vessels are a function of their relative size. In the Well Ops fleet our monohulls are geared for light well intervention with subsea intervention lubricator systems; however, the Well Enhancer can provide riser based operations for coiled tubing access if required. Our semi-submersible vessel the Q4000 and the Helix 534 will fundamentally perform the same operations covering all aspects of through tubing intervention using the same intervention riser system configuration. The Helix 534, being a 534 ft monohull, is capable of supporting the same operations as the Q4000 and as a consequence of its size is able to support the full range of services covering intervention, well clean up and flow back and well decommissioning.
<p> 5.       How does the Helix 534 represent a milestone for the company and its growing fleet of intervention vessels?
<p> As a company, Helix ESG has built up Well Ops through custom design of dedicated vessels and intervention riser systems. This commitment to the needs of customers for their subsea well intervention needs will not change. The modification of the Helix 534 is a variation of that approach, in that we are taking an existing vessel and applying our expertise to optimize it for well intervention operations. It is a slightly different method of delivering and expanding our Well Ops business unit, but one that satisfies the immediate need of our clients and something Helix ESG is very pleased to be a part of in terms of delivering a new option for our customers.
