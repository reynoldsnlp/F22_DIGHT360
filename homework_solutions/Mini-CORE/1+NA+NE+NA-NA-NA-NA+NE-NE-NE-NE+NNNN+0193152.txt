<h> Essex Police investigate 'lion' sighting near St Osyth
<p> Denise and Bob Martin said the animal they saw was "a very, very large cat"
<p> Police in Essex are investigating reports that a lion was spotted in a field at St Osyth near Clacton-on-Sea.
<p> The animal was seen near Earls Hall Drive by holidaymaker Bob Martin at about 19:00 BST on Sunday.
<p> Mr Martin said he and his wife Denise saw a large cat and a lion "was the first thing that came to mind".
<p> Colchester Zoo experts have said a definite identification of the animal was not possible based on a photograph taken by a member of the public.
<p> "We believe we saw a large cat looking at a tree... it just sat there looking at us," said Mr Martin.
<p> 'Preening itself'
<p> "Lion was the first thing that came into mind but it was several hundred yards away... it was very impressive."
<p> Mrs Martin added: "We saw this shape in the field, got our binoculars and it was a very, very large cat. At one time it stood up and looked at us, it was a bit spooky as it could obviously hear us, it was just preening itself.
<p> "To start with we was convinced it was a lion but the shape of the ears is slightly wrong, but it was the size of a lion. It had a white chest with like a tan, beige-colour body."
<p> Armed police have been drafted into the area and two police helicopters are searching the area where it was spotted. One of the helicopters is using a thermal imaging camera to try to detect any trace of an animal.

<p> Anthony Tropeano, zoological director of Colchester Zoo who has been at the scene, said: "The photograph shows an animal in a field, it is a sandy brown colour, but the photography is of such poor quality it's not possible for us to say one way or the other what it definitely is.
<p> "There were absolutely no sightings of it during the time I was there. Nothing really to provide any further evidence to suggest it had been there - just the fact of these couple of eye witness account and police had to err on the side of caution."
<p> Residents were advised by police on Sunday night to stay indoors, but police have said: "We want people to go out and enjoy themselves, but if they do wish to go for a country walk and use the fields and footpaths we ask them to be a bit cautious."
<p> Essex Police said about 25 officers were at the scene, including about a dozen specialist firearms officers, and experts from Colchester Zoo were also on hand. They are looking for signs such as pawprints.

<p> St Osyth resident Che Kevlin said he heard a ''loud roar''
<p> 'Loud roar'
<p> Police said all the animals at Colchester Zoo had been accounted for.
<p> The spokesman said a circus had been in the area, at Clacton Airfield, recently but added: "Officers have spoken to the circus and confirmed that they do not have an animal missing, nor do they have any lions."
<p> Local resident Che Kevlin told the BBC he heard a "loud roar" at 22:00 BST. He said that shortly after hearing the roaring sound he got a text from a relative telling him a lion was on the loose in St Osyth.
<p> "It was worrying as we had just been for a walk with the dog. We saw the police helicopter but thought it was just searching for a person," said Mr Kevlin.
<p> "It sounded like the roar of a lion. We have field and wood just behind our fence, so you never know."
<p> There are several holiday caravan parks in and around St Osyth and Sean Williams, who is in a caravan, said he was worried about going out.
<p> Mr Williams, who said he heard about the lion on Twitter, said: "The children are with me and we are quite worried. We were out in fields in St Osyth but we're back in the caravan now.
<p> "We've only seen one police car bombing it down the road. We had a fishing trip planned for tomorrow but we're now debating whether to carry on."
<p> Dave Sparks, who runs the Red Lion pub in St Osyth, said it had been a "surreal" night and told ITV News: "You don't really expect to be told there's a lion wandering around the area.
<p> "No-one really felt there was any immediate danger in the village - a couple of families with young children were a bit worried but after a while they were okay."
<p> Police are asking anyone who sees the animal to call 999.
<p> The news of a potential lion on the loose has captured the public imagination and three Twitter accounts - @EssexLion, @TheEssexLion and @Essex_Lion - were quickly set up.
