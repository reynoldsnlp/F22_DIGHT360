<p> Where are the ladies? where are the shadies? The Lizas, the Lotties and Lous? Where have they gone to? You know they want to All go in Revues Girls don't go off to work, all bus'ness now they shirk They've got in Revue On Revue there's now a run, if you'd like to go in one I'll tell you what to do Well, you've got to do this and you've got to do that If you want to get on in Revue Your Maudies and Bessies must wear pretty dresses And a dainty little shoe Plenty of ginger, snap your finger Let the Johnnies in the stalls get a view Have a smile on your face, show a little bit of lace If you want to get on in Revue.
<p> Flossie the Flapper was courting a Sapper Who from the front came home on leave And without any warning, he found that she'd gone in A Revue called 'I'VE SOMETHING UP MY SLEEVE' The first night that he got back, To the stage door he made a track To see his little Flossie, but he sighed For he found another battalion there Waiting for his Flossie fair When he said 'What's your game?' she calmly replied,
<p> 'Well, you've got to do this and you've got to do that If you want to get on in Revue The night may be 'parky' when a nice young man in Khaki Says, 'Come in my Lotus for a mile or two' If it's fine or if it's raining, remember he's in training 'Sit with me at the back' he'll say to you 'It's as soft as a sofa' but you're safer with the chauffeur If you want to get on in Revue.'
