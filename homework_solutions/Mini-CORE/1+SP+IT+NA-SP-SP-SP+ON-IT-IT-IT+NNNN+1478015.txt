<h> Eplot1c: "We realized we had to do it ourselves" - Interview
<p> As the dust settled after the Back Door Sluts 9 dramatic losses, I managed to catch Micke "Eplot1c" Anker from the team to have a little chat with him about the why's and how's of his team's results so far. We walked downstairs to the bar, set down behind an empty table and the questions started rolling. This is the written down version of the recorded interview.
<p> -Hey there...first questions first. What is going on right now? You guys have lost two matches in a row that should have been easy wins, what happened?
<p> I don't know, we're in a shock, really...we did not expect this at all. Euh, I don't know. We have to get it together, though. We need to win the next match. If we lose that, we drop out, we have to win the next match. If we don't it looks really bad, we need to win the next match.
<p> -Versus Jiggaw00h, you guys seemed very disoriented to me, like there were almost no team talks about what to do, like you guys did not have any set goal or coordination. What is your take on that? Before the match you told me that crash is one of your good maps, so you must have felt confident? Maybe too confident?
<p> Maybe too confident ye, because when we started playing, we noticed that they shot back and were really good. We kind of went into shock after that. I, personally, had like a bad beat, like in poker. I couldn't do anything, I don't know what happened. We were really, really, really bad. We don't know what happened, we are really disappointed.
<p> -Did you honestly expect Jiggaw00h to play so well? They were leading 09:04 versus Phantasmagoria the match before and still lost, do you think everyone underestimated them? Did you underestimate them?
<p> Yes, we definitely underestimated them. Even though we saw them play that good versus Phantasmagoria right before, we thought they would not play that well against us.
<p> If you say that, do you already think of yourself as being on a higher level than Phantasmagoria or?
<p> No no no. No, well you know, it was kind of fun to watch Phantasmagoria struggle like that. But I don't know, it will be really tight against Phantasmagoria, should we beat them.
<p> Eplot1c being frustrated at his Jiggaw00h match
<p> -What went on versus Immortal eSports on mp_citystreets? I saw the match started off semi close, but then Immortal finished the first half with 08 : 04 and even went up to 10 : 04. Then you guys woke up, made it close but the damage was already done or?
<p> I think that the main point here is that this game was right after the Jiggaw00h match and we were still in like a state of shock. We started really bad, but then again, we knew that if they [Immortal eSports] play good, they can actually beat us. Especially on mp_citystreets, unlike Jiggaw00h, where we expected to just overrun them. But still, it is like the same, we woke up too late, that's all.
<p> -So why did you guys not use a timeout or something, just to relax and calm down a bit?
<p> Indeed, indeed. It's too late to speculate now, but we were so down at the time to think about that.
<p> -So, if I understand correctly, you think of Immortal eSports as one of the dark horses of this event? They have done really well so far, do you think they can beat one of the top teams in the Playoffs as well, or is it just luck today?
<p> They are definitely the dark horses here, ye. I think they are even better offline than online, which is quite surprising, because I think it's the first LAN for many of them. I can see them at least taking a map from YoYoTech or Phantasmagoria or REGret eSports, it would not surprise me at all.
<p> -Are you content with your own play so far? Like how you are playing individually? If not, what is the problem, do you think? Are you nervous or is there something with your equipment?
<p> Ye, this is the worst LAN for me, ever. I have never played this badly before. I don't know why, I was in a bad beat, it was in my head, the problem. It's not, I cannot come up with any excuse, I was so bad. I am going to say, if we win the next match against Paranoia eSports, which we really should win, then we are fourth and we go to Playoffs. So if we win the next match and can play against Phantasmagoria with no pressure, I could get a good game there and boost up my confidence and play a lot better, like tomorrow as well.
<p> -Do you realistically still think that you can go for Gold, or are you just hoping to minimize the damage now? Or do you think that, once it's the Playoffs, there are new cards on the table and it's a fresh start?
<p> Tomorrow is a new day, definitely. We don't care if we meet Team YoYoTech first and play them in the first round. I don't care, personally, if we end up 5th or 2nd, there is no difference in my book. We need to beat all the teams, but ye, tomorrow is a completely new day and we will see then.
<p> Filter and Qoop both doubtful about the team's chances to progress
<p> -So what is the reason for your performance now? Is it a bad preparation or is everyone a bit "mindfucked", because I have seen ztkk become furious at the bad rounds and Filter not talking anything? So everyone was maybe just not playing well or?
<p> No no, preparation was great, so that is definitely not the cause. The problem is that we are not playing our game here, as we did online. We are playing completely different here, I have no idea why. Someone needs to step up.
<p> -On another note, you are also one of the head admins behind this event, could you tell me a bit about how it came to be and what you guys did to organize it? What was your role in particular?
<p> Ye, well, it started in January. The Finnish gaming league, the peliliga, which runs LANs here in Finland, quit with COD4, which was a shock. Then we realized that we needed to do it by ourselves, we needed to do all of it by ourselves. We are really lucky with this [venue], this is completely free. We have the equipment, pcs, room, everything for free. So ye, we just started negiotiating with these guys here and that's how it came about. Nothing else. There were no specific roles between us and just had two meetings here and I wrote some newsposts on the website of the tournament, that's it. It was really community-driven, it was really good.
<p> -Will this be a first of many HCC events or was this a one time thing? Will you look to become bigger or keep it like this, to support the local scene?
<p> This event has been really successful, thus far, and I really hope that we can arrange many more in the future. About how big it is going to be. Sixteen teams is the maximum amount here, and I am pretty sure we are going to try and keep it local, only Finnish teams here. Okay, maybe a few Swedish ones too. It has been really successful and I hope we can see this kinda same event in the Fall as well.
<p> -Concerning your playing future, are you expecting to go "serious" with Back Door Sluts 9? Get an organisation and start playing full time from now on? As I heard it, you just got together for this event and were not looking to continue after, or is that wrong?
<p> This was indeed a project for this LAN only, and we haven't thought about our future at all, to be honest. The main thing is here, we won't play until there is a LAN to look forward too. So we don't know the situation now, if there will be more LANs in Finland or not. [chuckles] At this moment, we don't look so confident to get an organisation or so. We will see after the event or so, what we will do as a team.
<p> -Okay, thank you for your time and wish you the best of luck for the remaining matches.
<p> I don't have much more to add, I just hope we will start playing better from now on. That's all. Thank you.
