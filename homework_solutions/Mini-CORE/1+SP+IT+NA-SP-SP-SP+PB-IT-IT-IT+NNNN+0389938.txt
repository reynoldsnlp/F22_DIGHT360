<p> Iain R Webb's 'Postcards From The Edge Of The Catwalk' is a personal photographic portfolio that spans 30 years of iconic catwalk moments and all the glamorous uproar surrounding it. A collection of intimate images taken by Webb, from the front row at couture and ready to wear shows, memories captured at hard to access fashion events and all the glitter of the fashion world.
<p> I reviewed the 272 page book in my 'On the Coffee Table' segment here.
<p> I was honoured to interview fashion journalist and lecturer, Iain R Webb (as featured in below image) whose career has including working as fashion editor at The Times, ELLE and Blitz.
<p> 1. Hello Iain, thank you for taking the time out to grant this interview. 'Postcards from the edge of the catwalk' takes its reader beyond the velvet rope at hard to access ready to wear and couture shows across a span of 3 decades. What gave you the presence of mind to capture these wonderful and many never seen before images?
<p> Hello Marian. Thanx for inviting me to talk about my new book. To tell the truth the book is a bit of a happy accident. I never imagined this kind of outcome when I was snapping away at the shows. I have always taken photographs -- at the collections, on fashion shoots and at parties -- as a kind of visual diary I guess. It was a way of documenting the weird and wonderful situations that I was lucky to find myself in as fashion editor of Blitz, The Times and Elle magazine. Some of these photographs were occasionally published over the years.

<p> 2. How did your personal portfolio of the fleeting magic of the catwalk turn into this must have book?
<p> 'Must have'. I like that. While I was working on my last book 'Foale and Tuffin. The Sixties. A Decade in Fashion', I pitched the idea of a postcard-style photo book to my commissioning editor Matthew Freedman at ACC Publishing Group. The format was inspired by the way I had the photographs processed at Snappy Snaps. They would be printed like holiday snaps and I would make little photocopy layouts. I wanted the book to show some of the wonderful moments I have experienced. Luckily Matthew and his team were equally excited by the project.

<p> 3. What was the process of compiling it like for you?
<p> The hardest thing for me was deciding what would go into the book. I am a habitual hoarder so my archive of source material is vast -- I have hung onto all sorts of odds and sods picked up along the way from invitations and notes from designers to shoot schedules and sketchbooks stashed away in folders, boxes and suitcases. They aren't particularly organised either although this is something I am now trying to sort out. So, at first I had to locate photos that I knew I had, unearth negatives for prints that remained hidden and then go about identifying designers, locations and seasons. I kept increasing the number of photographs I wanted to include and fortunately my publisher was happy to up the page count. But I still had to edit at least half of my original selection. I am happy with the final edit but I am still finding photos that I wish I could have included!

<p> 4. Your book captures some of the most important moments in fashion, what are your favourite images in it?
<p> This changes all the time. I like different pictures for different reasons. I really like the straightforward nature of many of the portraits -- the lucky one-in-a-million shot of Gwyneth Paltrow at the Gaultier show (page 58) or the happy-snap mood of Isabella Blow sparkling in iceberg size jewels (page 35). I really like the more obscure images of the catwalk shows -- the picture of a model exiting Yves Saint Laurent's catwalk, in her beaded lace and pink feather hat she merges into the floral bower decorating the stage (page 237), the line-up of McQueen models on page 235 or Jacquetta's legs at Helmut Lang (page 46 as seen below). I also love the Gaultier cowboys on page 160. That was a WILD (West) show!

<p> 5. Seeing that the images span 30 years of fashion change and evolution, would it be fair to say it was a photographic document of fashion history?
<p> Gosh, that makes it sound a bit grand! The book definitely documents a part of the fashion experience -- the craziness that surrounds the international collections. And I suppose it is a personal history.

<p> 6. How are you hoping for the book to be received by the fashion industry and fashion enthusiasts at large?
<p> I am thrilled with how people have already responded so warmly to my book. It has received great coverage in the press and there have been some very enthusiastic reviews. One reviewer said a more appropriate title for the book might be 'A Love Letter from the Edge of the Catwalk'. I really like that. I would like to think that it is an affectionate reminder for those who were there and hopefully an inspiration for those who were not.

<p> 7. What do you think constitutes to making a memorable catwalk show experience?
<p> A lot of people think that a memorable catwalk moment must mean a big bells-and-whistles production. While I have adored the shows of Galliano and McQueen and Mugler and Kenzo before them (and count myself lucky to have seen such amazing staging free of charge!) I also believe that a low-key presentation can be equally compelling. Rei Kawakubo sometimes shows her Comme des Garcons collections in complete silence. Sometimes the over-emphasis on hair, make-up, accessories and staging can detract from the frocks (the designers intention?!!). When designers get it right the production is an extended narrative that showcases their wonderful frocks. But small and quiet can be more beautiful. And the flick of a models wrist or the drape of a neckline can be equally memorable.

<p> 8. What is your most treasured catwalk/backstage memory to date and why?
<p> Goodness, there have been so many! Fashion is very subjective. I guess I treasure the more intimate things. From Art School onwards I have been incredibly lucky to meet so many fabulous people who share the same fascination with frocks. Getting to know people whose work I admire -- designers, writers, photographers, etc -- has been a real gift.

<p> 9. The photo captions truly bring each image to life. How did you go about writing these?
<p> What surprised me most was how I could almost instantly recognise a dress from twenty odd years ago especially considering how many dresses I must have seen during my career. I used my show notebooks and PR contacts to confirm dates and also referred to magazines and websites to double-check. At times it was like an Agatha Christie mystery. Indeed there are a couple of photographs that have no captions because no matter how I tried I could not discover the designer, date or location. I love the Index section -- it looks like a book in its own right. Simon Cryer of Northbank Design who designed the book did a brilliant job with the layouts.

<p> 10. One reason why 'Postcards from the edge of the catwalk' is a must for every coffee table? For anyone who is a fashion freak like me, it's the perfect Christmas gift! Thanx Iain x
