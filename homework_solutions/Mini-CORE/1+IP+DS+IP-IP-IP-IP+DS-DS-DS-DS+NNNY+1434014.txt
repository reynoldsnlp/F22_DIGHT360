<h> Biography
<p> Travis is one of the most successful bands to come out of the modern Brit-Pop scene, known for their hit singles including "Why Does It Always Rain On Me?", "Sing" and "Departed" - inspiring bands like Coldplay and Keane who came after them. In fact, Coldplay's Chris Martin calls himself a "poor man's Fran Healy," referring to Travis's lead singer and chief songwriter. It's understandable why... Read more in Amazon's Travis Store

<h> Amazon.co.uk Review
<p> The ultimate slow-burner, Travis's second album infused its way into the psyche of post- Radiohead Britain with an endearingly humble grace. It's not quite certain how Travis went from being the happy-clappy Britpop also-rans of their debut Good Feeling to becoming the gifted pop craftsmen that moulded the gentle emotional trough of the chart-topping The Man Who , but it would seem that the tired, lonely lovelorn niche is one that suits Travis rather well. So, "Writing To Reach You", "Driftwood" and "Why Does It Always Rain On Me?" are the meekest songs to ever eat daytime radio alive. Elsewhere, "As You Are" sounds like Thom Yorke swaddled in blankets, and the closing "Slide Show" punctures rock mythology with an impossibly beautiful lyric: "There is no design for life/ There's no devil's haircut in my mind/ There is not a wonderwall to climb, or step around". --Louis Pattison
<p> Having never heard of Travis, I bought the album on the back of the single 'Why Does It Always Rain On Me?', but I was still unsure. Having listened to it once I was captivated, after the second time, I was spellbound. Being a massive hard rock fan, it may surprise you that Travis' mellow tunes are possibly the best thing that I have heard for quite some time: its THAT good. Every song on the album is a potential release, and it appears that Fran and the rest of the group have put some thought into the album unlike some groups I have listened to. Don't cast the chance to buy it aside on the grounds that you only like 'Rap' or 'Heavy Metal'. Thanks to the sublime 'Driftwood', the passionate 'Last Laugh' and the thought-provoking 'Turn', this is an album of all tastes. Buy it, go on......
<p> The release of '12 Memories' triggered off a great realisation in my head. 'Oh yeah! Travis! Whatever happened to those guys?' I'll tell you what happened, a band by the name of Coldplay adopted the way that Travis balanced their varying audiences, and used no lack of charm to recieve world-wide aclaim. Yes Chris Martin and Co. are lovely chaps who have two great albums behind them. But Travis ae better. Make no mistake. 'The Man Who' is seemingly the best evidence of this, ten songs written and sung beautifully by frontman Fran Healy. At the time of release it was what the pop industry was crying out for, bridging the gap between pop surbanity like the Stereophonics and the inaccesibilty of Radiohead. A wonderful effort and a great array of melancholy yet inspiring tunes (Starsailor take note). But has anyone else completely had it up to here with 'Why Does it Always Rain on Me'?
<p> It seems that these songs were written especially for me. I can relate to them extremely well. They combine fantastic, truthful, deep lyrics with catchy tunes that I caught myself humming when I wasn't even thinking about it. It isn't often that I buy CDs which have nothing but brilliant songs on it, and this is one of them. I can't decide which is my favourite, but it is either Writing To Reach You or Turn. There is also a 'secret song' at the end of the album, which is worth buying the entire CD for.
