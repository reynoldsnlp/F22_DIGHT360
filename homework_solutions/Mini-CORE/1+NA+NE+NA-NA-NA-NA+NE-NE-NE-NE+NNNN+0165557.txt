<p> MADRID | Sun Mar 11, 2012 5:01pm GMT
<p> MADRID (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Spaniards protested on Sunday against a new labour law which hands more power to employers by making it cheaper to fire workers and easier to restrict wage hikes.
<p> The demonstrations were the first since unions called a general strike for March 29 and add to a growing number of street protests against government reforms and spending cuts aimed at putting Spain's finances back on track.
<p> Union organisers said as many as half a million people attended the peaceful marches in 60 cities, where protesters beat drums and waved red union flags, although police gave no official estimate.
<p> Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the European Union at 23 percent and the government predicts this will hit a record high of 24.3 percent this year. Spain accounts for nearly a third of all the jobless in the euro zone.
<p> The centre-right government says measures like cutting severance pay to 33 days for every year worked from 45 days and restricting inflation-linked salary hikes will bring flexibility to Spain's rigid labour market.
<p> The government is desperate to show Brussels it is serious about enforcing unpopular structural reforms and spending cuts aimed at keeping its budget under control.
<p> But protesters in Madrid said the measures wrecked workers' rights.
<p> "It's damaging for workers, it makes it easier to fire people, it benefits employers -- they're laying us off across the public sector," said Irene Jimenez, a 29-year-old health worker on the latest of a series of three-month contracts.
<p> The reform would not help Spain's unemployed, public sector employee Jose Javier Rodriguez, 53, said.
<p> "It's absurd to think you're going to bring down unemployment by making it easier to fire people," he said.
<p> The March 29 general strike is the first since September 2010 when unions balked at a watered-down labour reform enforced by the previous Socialist government.
<p> The 2010 strike had limited impact aside from disrupting transport and factories.
<p> Around three-quarters of Spaniards do not believe the labour reform will help create jobs, according to a recent poll. However, 67 percent believe a general strike will not help matters and may make the situation worse.
