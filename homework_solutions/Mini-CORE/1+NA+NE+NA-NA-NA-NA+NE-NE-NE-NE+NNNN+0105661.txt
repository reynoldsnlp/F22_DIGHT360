<h> Protest intermediary backs PM
<p> THE opposition will ask the Australian Federal Police today to investigate the role of Julia Gillard's office and a Canberra union leader in the Australia Day security breach that led to the Prime Minister being spectacularly dragged to safety.
<p> Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said yesterday that Ms Gillard's former media adviser Tony Hodges and Unions ACT secretary Kim Sattler should make sworn statements about their part in events leading up to Thursday's near riot. Tent embassy protesters stormed Canberra's Lobby Restaurant, where Ms Gillard and Mr Abbott were attending an emergency service medal presentation.
<p> Mr Abbott called on Ms Gillard to apologise to the medal recipients whose ceremony was disrupted.

<p> Mr Hodges was forced to resign on Friday for passing on information to Ms Sattler - so she could alert protesters - about remarks Mr Abbott had made and his presence at the restaurant.

<p> Ms Gillard has revealed that her senior staff failed to tell her until Friday afternoon about Mr Hodges' action - even though he had informed her communications director, John McTernan, and senior press secretary Sean Kelly on Thursday, after the fracas.
<p> Asked about the tent embassy early on Thursday, Mr Abbott said it was time to ''move on'' after the changes that had taken place in Aboriginal affairs since it was set up 40 years ago. ''I think the indigenous people of Australia can be very proud of the respect in which they are held by every Australian and yes, I think a lot has changed since then and I think it probably is time to move on from that,'' he said.
<p> This was conveyed to the crowd as Mr Abbott saying the embassy should be torn down.
<p> Mr Hodges told his superiors he reported Mr Abbott's comment accurately to Ms Sattler. Ms Gillard insisted at the weekend that Mr Hodges ''at no time'' misrepresented Mr Abbott's remarks but had thought they should be responded to in the media and that a couple of spokespeople should be available to do so.
<p> The Prime Minister reiterated yesterday that Mr Hodges had acted without any authorisation. ''No one else was part of that decision'', she said. The first she heard of his role from her staff was when she returned to Melbourne on Friday from Flowerdale, one of the towns devastated in the Black Saturday fires. This is despite her chief of staff, Ben Hubbard, who was aware of Mr Hodges' action, being in the car with her on Friday.

<p> After yesterday calling on Ms Gillard to move for a police inquiry the opposition will act itself today. Shadow attorney-general George Brandis will write to federal police Chief Commissioner Tony Negus asking for an investigation that covers the breach of the PM's security and associated issues.
<p> Mr Abbott said: ''It should be unthinkable for a security breach of this nature not to be fully investigated by the Australian Federal Police.'' Australia
<p> Day had seen ''the most serious security breach involving our nation's top leaders since the 1970s''.
<p> He said Ms Gillard needed to say ''what she was told verbatim by her office and by her former staffer. We need to know who knew what when and exactly who said what when''.
<p> ''This is a government of deception and dirty tricks,'' Mr Abbott said.
<p> Ms Gillard, appearing at a news conference with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, said she had been briefed on Friday afternoon. ''My staff had been working to make sure that they could give me a complete factual brief,'' she said. ''There were a number of allegations circulating around the media at the time, including for example that a female staff member had made a telephone call. So matters needed to be checked. All of those matters were checked.''
<p> Ms Sattler made several contradictory comments about the affair. She initially told The Canberra Times Mr Hodges had not spoken to her. She told News Ltd's Sunday papers that Mr Hodges had spoken to her and said Mr Abbott had said the embassy should not exist. ''I do now accept that wasn't what Tony Abbott said,'' she added.
<p> On Saturday she said Mr Hodges had quoted Mr Abbott as saying people should ''move on'' from the tent embassy. Yesterday she claimed the News Ltd report that she had contradicted Ms Gillard was inaccurate. Mr Hodges ''told me what Tony Abbott had said - that people should 'move on' from the tent embassy'', she said yesterday. Ms Gillard said the two statements Ms Sattler had issued accorded with her own version of events.
<p> Mr Abbott, wanting to keep the heat on the government, dodged questions about whether the opposition would refer the affair to the police. ''This is something which the government should be doing, just because of the nature of the incident.''
<p> He said he wanted to give the PM ''the chance to do the right thing. Plainly her office ... has grievously done the wrong thing.''
<p> Mr Abbott said the PM's staff were in the press gallery on Thursday afternoon claiming the violence was his fault. ''Now for the Prime Minister's office to be claiming that it was my fault when they had an obvious involvement in all of this, I think is really low. At the very least the Prime Minister should be offering an apology to everyone who was in that awards ceremony.''
<h> Poll: Should there be a police inquiry into the Australia Day fracas involving Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott?
