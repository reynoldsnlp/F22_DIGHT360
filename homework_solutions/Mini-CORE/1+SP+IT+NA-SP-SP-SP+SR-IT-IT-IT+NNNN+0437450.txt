<p> Q: Starting 21st, you finished 10th. It must be your race was interesting? Nico Rosberg Yes, today was a lot of overtaking, some pilots, I overtook two or even three times and enjoyed the fight. With the DRS to overtake here is not that hard - a great idea was the emergence of this decision.
<p> Tenth place at the finish - not the best result, but I'm glad that earned a point after the start of the 21 th position. Nevertheless, I must say that the last few weeks we had a sobering effect upon - in the two races I have earned only one point, and must do their utmost to Hungary to do more. Our whole team needs to make progress.
<p> Q: What, above all, you need to add? Nico Rosberg : In all aspects, but above all - in aerodynamics. The team invited the new head of aerodynamics, last week I met with him and I must say that he has great ideas. I am optimistic about the future.
<p> Q: How do you assess the results of the first half of the season ? Nico Rosberg : Excluding the last two Grand Prix all went very well, but the weekends at Silverstone and Hockenheim were unsuccessful.
<p> Nevertheless, I must say that compared to last year we made a major step forward. Such was the purpose - to make progress, and the victory podium and began a nice bonus, but now we want more. It's time to take the next step.
