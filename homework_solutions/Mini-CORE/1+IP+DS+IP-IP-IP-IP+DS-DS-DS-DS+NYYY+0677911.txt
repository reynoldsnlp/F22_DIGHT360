<p> Orphaned by the plague, penniless, and without friends, Mateo must find his way in the world. What he discovers is the adventure of a lifetime. Soon Mateo is at sea, a cabin boy on the celebrated voyage of Captain-General Ferdinand Magellan. The destination is secret, but the crew whispers that Magellan will be the first to sail east to the Spice Islands by going west -and everyone shall return with untold riches. Life at sea is everything Mateo expected-and more. He discovers the meaning of friendship, loyalty, and hard work, as well as the delight of first love. But when the sea rages and brother turns against brother, both Mateo and Magellan are in danger-and it's not clear if anyone will survive. . . .
