<h> Feel The Same Way I Do Lyrics
<h> Destiny's Child
<p> You know, we've been spending a lot of time together And um, I was wondering do you Feel the same way I do I can tell you, I know you need me to show you But, it's better if I hear it from you You know what, let me explain myself It's 7 a.m., you're still here with me And last night I held you tightly so What does that mean ? You see I know what it means to me It means that I wouldn't let you go, tell me Is your heart still spinning from the night before? You are real good, yeah And you really need to let me know Are you here just for sexual dealings See if you are then I, I just can't live a lie 'Cause I'm certain how I feel about you But if you tell me I am the one and this is right We can spend the night tonight like always But first you, gotta tell me That you feel the same way I do Darling you know That I won't let you know unless you Feel the same way I do So if you tell me what I gotta do Before I get caught up in you, do you really Feel the same way I do So tell me, tell me us could be a good thing But you gotta feel the same way I do So now it's midnight, haven't heard a reply But I can see the truth lies in your eyes Could it be that you tried But I didn't see the sunset pass me bye When you were making love to me Said it three times, you said "You love me" after you held me But then you never even said goodnight Anything I ask of you, you give it When you wanted me I submitted Still no commitment but if I don't get it then I I just can't live a lie 'Cause I'm certain how I feel about you But if you tell me I, I am the one and this is right You can spend the night tonight like always Long as you first tell me That you feel the same way I do Darling you know That I won't let you know unless you Feel the same way I do So if you tell me what I gotta do Before I get caught up in you, do you really Feel the same way I do So tell me, tell me this could be a good thing But you gotta feel the same way I do Oh, I see your eyes, and I hear you calling When you're speaking And I need to hear something First thing I wanna hear I've been meaning to tell you something The second thing is If I can't have you I don't want nothing Who that knockin' at my door this time of night? Ooh, oh, hey baby What you doing over here so late? I wanted to tell you somethin' I just, I don't know how to tell you right Do you have anything you want to say? Alright, you know what, I love you Feel the same way I do Feel the same way I do Feel the same way I do
