<h> When You See My Friends lyrics
<h> Mayday Parade When You See My Friends lyrics
<p> I'm burned out like a bright light, I wasn't ready for this You're adorable as hell, but I'm glancing at your wrist Oh please have faith, I can be so cavalier And when they start to ask questions I'll make sure to be clear
<p> And when you see my friends tell them hi for me And tell them what you think about the way you handled everything You turned and all you left me with was this broken key So tell me what you think
<p> Give it up for the long nights and all those terrible fights Were you honest with yourself, every version of yourself? Did you get lost on the side of the road? If you keep acting this way, I swear I'll never come home [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/mayda\\... ] And when you see my friends, tell them hi for me And tell them what you think about the way you handled everything We walk alone on this broken road for eternity So give me company and help me sing this lonely melody You turned and all you left me with was this broken key So tell me what you think
<p> Sign me up, no regrets, make a man out of me And I won't say a word and I'll give all the things that you want And I need just to give me some peace At the bottom of the ocean, there's a place for you and me Lead the way, straight ahead, you gave me the time of my life And cut like a knife to the bone
<p> When you see my friends, tell them hi for me And tell them what you think about the way you handled everything So neat and clean well the world is full of such pretty things So do your best for me
