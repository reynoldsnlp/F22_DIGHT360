<p> With New Zealand Fashion Week coming up fast, the FOUREYES guys from www.eyeseyeseyeseyes.com sat down with Kirsha Whitcher from Salasai for a quick interview on her brand, her style and her plans for the week!
<p> What inspired the collection you are about to show at NZFW? New found love in old small time America inspired by the 1950's movie 'Revolutionary Road'. This collection depicts the high hopes a couple has when they meet and fall in love, the idealistic view of the unknown road ahead and the unrealistic fantasy they have of each other.
<p> How are you preparing for NZFW? Just locking in appointments, Dan Ahwa our Salasai stylist has been on the ball with our actual show and all its prep, he's been attending meetings and sorting music, models, hair with Lauren Gunn from Stephen Marr , make up with Amber D from MAC and footwear the entire package, he's been amazing.
<p> How do you think showing at NZFW helps your brand? Total exposure, exposure to buyers, customers, media, industry insiders showing helps the brand communicate which is why we do it.
<p> What would you be doing if you had not ventured into fashion design? Architect for sure.
<p> What was the last fashion item you bought for yourself? Whittner tan wide heeled shoes in suede with tassels.
