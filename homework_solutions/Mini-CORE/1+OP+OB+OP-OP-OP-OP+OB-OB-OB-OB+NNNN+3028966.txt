<p> 'Entitlement'  my arse, I paid good money for my State Pension and other benefits!!!! Just because they borrowed that  money, doesn't make my benefits some kind of  charity or handout !! Gold plated MP pensions and  Government  benefits,  aka free healthcare, outrageous retirement  packages, 67 paid holidays, 20 weeks paid  vacation, unlimited paid sick days, now that's  welfare, and they have the nerve to call me a 'greedy pensioner' and my  retirement, an 'entitlement' !!!!!!.....scroll  down................
<p> What  the HELL's wrong with us???
<p> WAKE  UP BRITAIN !!!! Someone please tell  me what the HELL's wrong with all the people  that run this country!!!!!! We're "broke"  & can't help our own Pensioners, Veterans,  Orphans, Homeless  etc.,??????????? but spent 1.2 billions of 's for G-20 events! In the  last few months we have provided aid to India, Greece and Turkey . And now Afghanistan ,  Pakistan ...... home of bin Laden.   Literally, BILLIONS of POUNDS!!!
<p> Our  retirees living on a 'fixed income'  receive no aid nor do they get any breaks while  our government and religious organisations pour  Hundreds of Billions of 's and tons of  food to foreign  countries!
<p> They  call Old Age Security and Healthcare an  entitlement even though most of us have been  paying for it all our working lives and now when  it's time for us to collect, the government is  running out of money. Why did the government  borrow from it in the first  place? We have  hundreds of adoptable children who are shoved  aside to make room for the adoption of foreign  orphans. GREAT BRITAIN:  a country where we have homeless without  shelter,  children going to bed hungry, hospitals being closed, average income families who can't afford dental care, elderly going without 'needed' med's and having to travel 100?s of miles for medical care with no reimbursement of cost, vehicles we can't afford fuel for, lack of affordable housing, and mentally  ill without treatment -- etc., etc. YET..... They  have a 'benefit'  for the people of foreign countries...ships and planes lining up with food, water,  tents, clothes, bedding, doctors, and medical  supplies. Imagine if  the *GOVERNMENT* gave 'US' the same support they  give to other countries. Sad  isn't it? 99% of  people won't have the guts to forward this. I'm  one of the 1% -- I Just Did.
