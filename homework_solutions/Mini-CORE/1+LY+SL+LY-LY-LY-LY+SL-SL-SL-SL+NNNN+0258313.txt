<p> Well I wish that I was dead, yeah I wish that I was dead. They told me life is but a dream, but all I dream are tragic scenes, to be alive, I just don't care, eternal questions everywhere. Sometimes in life we stumble, oh Lord and we fall. I want to end it all, to end it all. You'll find me hanging from a tree, or underneath the deep blue sea. It doesn't matter where I lie, the graveyard or the highway side
