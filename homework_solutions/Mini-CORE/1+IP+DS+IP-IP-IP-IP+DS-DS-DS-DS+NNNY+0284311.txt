<h> Biography
<p> One day in the early 1970's, English composer Simon Jeffes was in the South of France, suffering from a terrible bout of food poisoning. He had a series of feverish waking dreams featuring a dystopian view of the near future, where all was grey and concrete.

<p> Arthur Jeffes has a difficult problem.He will always be compared to his brilliant and wildly original father,especially as he has bravely set out to continue his dad's musical tradition.with the Penguin Cafe Orchestra,Simon Jeffes created some of the most unusual and delightful music of the last 40 years,an "imaginary folk" style that mixed classical and global influences with the patterns and repetition of systems music,with predictably quirky instrumentation.With his Music from the Penguin Cafe band he has recorded an album of his own compositions in much the same style. These Penguins are at the best when the instrumentation is more experimental.There's rousing cuatro work on the atmospheric, Latin influenced Pale Peach Jukebox,upbeat ukelule playing on Two Beans Shaker,and a fine blend of Kathryn Tickell Northumbrian pipes and piano on Landau. *** --The Guardian,28/01/11
<p> I was a big fan of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, and bought this knowing that it was not the same band, but a band of new musicians led by Arthuer Jeffes. However, from the first track, it's like an old friend returning. It's all there: the jaunty rythmns, changes in key, mournful strings and minimal percussion. Occasionally, I did feel it sounded a bit too forced, and really would have loved to have heard some folks like Geoffrey Richardson on there, and maybe a bit variety in the instrumentation (Too much piano!), but it's Jeffes' legacy now and it appears to be in good hands. A joy from start to finish, and essential for any fans of the Penguin Cafe Ochestra. It's great to see it back open for business, and let's hope there's more where this came from!
<p> Mr. Soft Machine's review has summed up this release and the whole ethos of Penguin Cafe in a very concise manner. Hats off! Therefore, I will keep this review brief.
<p> Listening to this wonderful album right now, I am bowled over by its consistently gorgeous melodies. Tunes such as "Landau", "Harry Piers" and "From a Blue Temple" are taking my soul to such lofty heights. Simon Jeffes would be very proud I'm sure of what his son Arthur and his dazzlingly talented group have created here.
<p> Simply, listening to "A Matter Of Life" frequently induces the same amount of euphoria within me that the original Penguin Cafe Orchestra were so often capable of raising. I can think of no higher praise than that!
<p> Mr Soft Machine and Brendan have basically said all I want to say but thought I would chip in anyway. It is familiar to those who know the Penguin Cafe Orchestra - but also different as there are some new musical influences in there. I saw the Penguin Cafe in concert this week and it was fantastic. And lovely. Arthur Jeffes is a top bloke and was even a bit emotional at one point talking about his father. A nice group of people who all looked as though they were thoroughly enjoying themselves (apart from one of the ukelele players who was trying the moody look but just ended up looking bored!). My favourite tracks are the first two and Pale Peach Jukebox and Harry Piers (which Arthur wrote for his father's memorial service). But the whole album is really good
