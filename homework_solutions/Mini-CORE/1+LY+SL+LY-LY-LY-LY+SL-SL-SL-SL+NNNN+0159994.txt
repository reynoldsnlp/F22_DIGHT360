<p> He left no time to regret, kept his dick wet With his same old safe bet Me and my head high and my tears dry Get on without my guy
<p> You went back to what you knew so far removed From all that we went through And I tread a troubled track, my odds are stacked I'll go back to black
<p> We only said goodbye with words I died a hundred times You go back to her And I go back to, I go back to us
<p> I love you much, it's not enough You love blow and I love puff And life is like a pipe And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside [ From : http://www.elyrics.net/read/a/amy-wineho\\... ]
<p> We only said goodbye with words I died a hundred times You go back to her When I go back to
<p> We only said goodbye with words I died a hundred times You go back to her And I go back to
<p> Black, black, black, black Black, black, black I go back to I go back to
<p> We only said goodbye with words I died a hundred times You go back to her And I go back to
<p> We only said goodbye with words I died a hundred times You go back to her And I go back to black
