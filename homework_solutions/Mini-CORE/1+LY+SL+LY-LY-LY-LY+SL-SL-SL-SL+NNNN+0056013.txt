<h> Meet Me in The Morning Lyrics
<h> Bob Dylan
<p> Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha Honey, we could be in Kansas By time the snow begins to thaw They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn Honey, you wouldn't know it by me Every day's been darkness since you been gone Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind Well, I feel just like that rooster Honey, you treat me so unkind Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above Well, you know I even out ran the hound dogs Honey, you know I've earned your love Look at that sun, sinkin' like a ship Look at that sun, sinkin' like a ship Ain't that just like my heart, babe When you kissed my lips?
