<h> Love Is the Only Soldier music CDs Customer Reviews
<p> Another great album from this lady Anyone who has not listened to Jann Arden is missing out on wonderful music. This album is great but I would also highly recommend 'Living Under June' which in my opinion is her best album ever. Once you listen to Jann Arden you will keep buying her music - she is a superb artist and my husband enjoys her voice and lyrics as much as I do. By JUDITHWOOD2003 (Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.)
<p> jann continues to weave her magic A well produced cd with fine musicianship embellishing Jann's distinctive vocals. Not quite as immediate as her previous studio record ( Blood red cherry )a difficult act to follow, never the less there are some fine moments on this CD. My only real diappointment is that the whole record turns in at a meagre 39mins. In the age of bonus tracks, enhanced media,video & having to import this CD I feel a little short changed. The price I have to pay I suppose to get her music to the UK.Keep making the music Jann. By a reviewer (southampton england)
<p> Love Is the Only Soldier songs Singer-songwriter Jann Arden's star has dimmed in the United States since her Lilith Fair era heyday; like her cohorts Lisa Loeb and Jewel, she's even taken to reality television hosting gigs ...
