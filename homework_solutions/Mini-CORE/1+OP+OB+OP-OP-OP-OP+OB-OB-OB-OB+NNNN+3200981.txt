<h> This should play well with the parents of teenagers...
<p> SCHULTZ : I don't think Governor Palin could get 40 million viewers on TV. So -- she's got to raise the bar when it comes to interest. Half the country doesn't even know who she is.
<p> And, Larry, I want to announce tonight that most liberals think that we have absolutely the best vice-presidential pick in Joe Biden. Experience does count. And the fact is, look, it's unfortunate that there is maybe an unwanted pregnancy of a teenager.
<p> That's not the issue. The issue is the Republicans have made themselves out to be the party of values and have talked down to Democrats saying that we're Godless, that we have no values.
<p> They put both value signs up in yards in South Dakota to defeat Tom Daschle. This is their signature issue. And now, when this comes along and it doesn't really fit too well, oh we can't talk about it anymore. Come on.
<p> SANCHEZ : That's not...
<p> SCHULTZ : The facts are this. What kind of mother is she? Is she prepared to be the vice president? Is she going to be totally focused on the issues.
<p> MOLINARI : Wow. You got to be...
<p> SANCHEZ : Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<p> SCHULTZ : There are questions.
<p> MOLINARI : I bet you don't have a lot of women listeners there, do you? If you do, you're not going to have them tomorrow after...
<p> SCHULTZ : Actually, today on my show, I took only phone calls...
<p> MOLINARI : Oh my gosh.
<p> SANCHEZ : Wow.
<p> SCHULTZ : from women and they are not happy with them.
<p> MOLINARI : So every -- so every person out there who has an unwanted pregnancy in their family is a result of bad mothering? Wow. That's really bold to say that.
<p> SCHULTZ : Don't tell me she's a role model.
<p> MOLINARI : Come on...
<p> SCHULTZ : You know, most professional gardeners have a really nice yard, you know what I mean?
<p> SANCHEZ : You know what, she's...
<p> SCHULTZ : Most professional gardeners cut their own lawn.
<p> SANCHEZ : No, I'm thinking in all of our families...
<p> SCHULTZ : It seems to me they have trouble in their backyard.
<p> Of course, by this logic, the fact that Hillary's hubby was getting his gear shaft polished under the desk means Hillary is not qualified to lead. But no matter.
<p> This kind of argument -- which, let's face it, Schultz would never be making were the candidate a man (must be part of the new feminism , incidentally: working women, for all their professional accomplishments, are to be judged by the mistakes of their children -- not how they react to those mistakes , which, in the masculine Obama's case, we know would be to get rid of the "punishment" ) -- suggests that Sarah Palin is a bad mother, not because of a mistake made by her teenage daughter, but because she wasn't there to stop it .
<p> Or, to put it another way, what was this Palin woman thinking taking a job while she should have been home, in the kitchen, each morning fastening a chastity belt around her daughter's honeypot?
<p> I mean, it's one thing to want to work and act like a man when you haven't the burden of children -- or when you are at least prepared to pony up for a strict Catholic nanny from South America to beat some respect into the child. But, c'mon, honey: playtime is over. Tend your garden, like a good little squaw. Then you might not have yourself a knocked up trailer trash daughter.
<p> Jesus. Can you imagine a "liberal" radio host making this same argument were Palin and her daughter Democrats and black ? Of course not. Instead, we'd be treated to a nonstop narrative of sacrifice and the difficulties of growing up black in America -- of cultural pressures, the differences between black and white, etc.
<p> And at some level, even Obama seems to understand this -- which is why he spent yesterday trying to rein in his more hamfisted Alinskyites.
<p> Unfortunately, he allowed these kinds of folks to believe their own bullshit for so long, that they've convinced themselves they know what they're doing, and that the kind of "lesson" they're offering will resonate with the American people.
<p> -- Which, it that's the case and they are correct, means this country has been damaged beyond repair.
<p> Speaking of which, where's Oprah? Is she going to defend Sarah Palin and Bristol? Or does "every woman" only include the authentic ones -- y'know, those who vote straight Democrat...?
<h> Comments (395)
<p> PLEASE tell me that the McCain camp is going to do something about this. I can't even stand to read anymore. It's just too outrageous for this little stay at home mom. Is it possible to have a stroke just reading blogs??
<p> There's nothing McCain can do about it without sounding heavy-handed for whiny.
<p> It's OK for Obama's minions to "flood the zone" to try to chase Kurtz out of the public arena, but any attempt by McCain to ask people to watch their mouths will be turned into "censorship", "oppression", and "threats".
<p> Actually, mojo, I think it's Ed Schultz. Who, if I can trust my Google, is WAY more of an idiot.
<p> My two cents: I can't wait to see the poll numbers in the next few days. Especially if there's some sort of demographic dimension.
<p> Or, as others more intelligent than me have said (I'm paraphrasing): "How many voters were pregnant on their wedding day?" and "How many Democrats does it take to lose a won election? I think we're about to find out."
<p> Final thought: if Sarah is as tough as she seems, I'm guessing Bristol is, too...
<p> PLEASE tell me that the McCain camp is going to do something about this. I canA,,t even stand to read anymore. ItA,,s just too outrageous for this little stay at home mom. Is it possible to have a stroke just reading blogs??
<p> The McCain camp is doing what it ought, being quiet. Obama's minions think that evangelical Christians will dump the good governor; the Obamanaics believe American women will like being told that if your child got pregnant as a teenager, you are a stupid ass of a mother and cannot do anything important, as a result, for America. And any and all who ever raised a teeenage will know that it is impossible to control one at all times, even with the "finest" of upbringings, and this will piss off a lot of people...A LOT OF PEOPLE. Just think: the majority of single women giving birth in the U.S. are probably black, and libs are calling each and every mother of a pregnant teenager a stupid boob.
<p> For Barack Obama, a baby is a punishment; Palin calls a new life a blessing. Who would you want int he White House?
<p> They also mistake WHO is having a baby. Yes, the girl is age 17 and she may or may not be able to completely care for that baby. I don't know. Neither do the mouth breathing lefties hyperventilating over the "alleged" hypocricy. But the fact remains that Bristol's baby will be cared for. She has a large loving family that will care for that baby, emotionally, physically and the only way that is at all relevant to the rest of the fucking country not named the Palins, financially. I don't have to help pick up the tab to help raise that baby. It isn't any of my fucking business.
<p> Hello. parallel universe people. Long time no see. Your flailing about is comical. Don't you think your anger might be more productive directed at Sen McCain for putting you in this awkward and embarrassing position? Jeez, how much of his crap are you willing to eat?
<p> A nervous young McCain staffer took it upon himself to explain to Palin the facts of life in a national campaign, the intense scrutiny she'd be under from the media, the viciousness of the assault that she'd be facing, etc.:
<p> Palin: "Thanks for the warning. By the way, do you know what they say the difference is between a hockey mom and a Pit Bull?"
<p> No, david. I think McCain made a brilliant pick and I'm really sort of enjoying watching the left shoot itself in the head. Both your Pres and VP candidates are telling you to, for the love of God, please shut the fuck up, but your lot just can't help itself.
<p> I'm not flailing at all. Wokking the scalpel a bit, true. But even that is for my own entertainment, something I have an abundance of at the moment. But please, tell me more.
<p> Rep. FERRARO: Sure you can ask but I have, you know, I'm like one of you people. I'm sitting here working on my decision. Yeah, I'm a Democrat and I am a person who feels very, very strongly about issues that face this country. So, when I go into the booth I will make my decision.
<p> I'm waiting for just one of the billions and billions of Darwin-to-the-bone geniuses that I've been assured all my life all non-Republicans are to note that Palin's daughter is at the ideal age to have a healthy baby without complication to her or it, and praise her for not letting rube-morality or any of several oppressive and/or eugenics-serving false consciousnesses or manipulated-from-above social identities or, fuck it, The Republican War On Science! deter her from the wisest possible exercise of her reproductive rights. Medically speaking. Because SCIENCE .
<p> Re #19: in fact, I'm wondering if today is where the long slide into Dukakis territory will begin, largely as a result of Obama's demonstrated lack of control over his minions. But I'm trying hard not to get too cocky over the dumbness of the Donks.
<p> DonA,,t you think your anger might be more productive directed at Sen McCain for putting you in this awkward and embarrassing position?
<p> What "awkward and embarassing position"? It ain't the right attacking a girl. It ain't the right trying to pry into the most private aspects of a family.
<p> I'm more impressed with Palin than I've ever been with McCain. That her teenage daughter has a mind of her own is no slam on her -- and that Bristol has chosen the most responsible, most difficult path is a credit to her.
<p> There you go David. Not as thick as a brick, after all. Keep working at it and all shall be revealed. When in doubt, from now on, just remember that (in the immortal words of the Firesign Theater) EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS WRONG!
<p> and that Bristol has chosen the most responsible, most difficult path is a credit to her.
<p> I love this line: "We don't believe women should have the right to choose, not even when they're 1) raped or 2) raped by a relative, but Bristol's decision to carry the baby to term is a choice worthy of the highest accolades." Because the alternative is to believe she considered terminating the pregnancy, a sort of choice-for-me-but-not-for-thee situation, and if you believe that , you're less pro-life than a pro-life hypocrite.
<p> Put differently: you don't applaud people for "deciding" between Option 1 and Option 1 unless you secretly believe they're hypocrites, and if you do, well, why are you applauding them?
<p> Look, I understand you all feel you have no choice but to buy in for the moment. She may actually still be on the ticket next week. I'm just trying to empathize with your predicament. It must be very troubling to have your leader dump one so squarely on your heads. Oy.
<p> O! is not qualified to be president and was never properly vetted by the MSM or the democratic party primary voters. Indeed, O! is less qualified to be President than Palin, he has less accomplishments in life and less experience and his personal history has never been properly explored or investigated. Here is why:
<p> * He was an affirmative action admission at Harvard law (he has not released his college grades, LSAT score, or law school grades yet A,_o which indicates that he was not a stellar student that had the grades to get into Harvard absent affirmative action);
<p> * He was an affirmative action pick onto the law review (again, he did not grade-on or write-on to law review so he could only get on to law review through some kind of affirmative action);
<p> * He has not accomplished anything as an elected official (name one important piece of legislation he has authored);
<p> * HeA,,s written no published articles to demonstrate academic ability;
<p> * He admits in his books that he purposefully sought out Marxist mentors and teachers in college, indeed one of his major mentors in life was an avid Marxist.
<p> * heA,,s done nothing courageous in his life, not even taking a courageous stance on any legislation (indeed, he voted A,"presentA,A_ on almost all controversial bills in the IL state senate);
<p> * heA,,s never sacrificed anything for any cause;
<p> * heA,,s never accomplished anything outside of elected office.
<p> * the man is as empty a suit as exists, with no real proof of intellectual bona fides nor even a consistent set of policy ideas (he switches his stances 180 degrees within weeks of taking a stance based on polls).
<p> * He went to a church for 20 years where hatred of white people was routinely preached and hatred of America was routinely preached.
<p> * he worked closely with and was friends with an admitted and unrepentant domestic terrorist A,_o Bill Ayers (and others);
<p> * he voted against criminalizing the killing of babies that were born alive when he was in the Illinois State Senate;
<p> * He has a shady financial relationship with convicted felon Tony Rezko.
<p> What exactly is it about this admitted cocaine dealer that the left finds so great?
<p> "Speaking of which, whereA,,s Oprah? Is she going to defend Sarah Palin and Bristol? Or does A,"every womanA,A_ only include the authentic ones A,__ yA,,know, those who vote straight DemocratA,A? "
<p> You know, if you stop and think about it for a moment, just what has been Oprah's payback for supporting Obama? I can't find anything more recent than this from the LA Times blogs:
<p> "Panagopoulos draws the conclusion that in these days of pervasive media, in reality, celebrity endorsements run the real risk of costing the celebrity more than they benefit the endorsee. So celebs may want to think twice before hitting the stump. "
<p> Oprah's existence doesn't involve women. It is women. Women leaving the TV on when her show is on. Women in her book club. Women subscribing to her magazine...
<p> Sarah Palin is very popular just not with Democrats cause her daughter is going to be a mom at a younger age than they think she should. They've been really vocal about it. Like they want another one of them "national discussion" thingers. But no one really believes they really actually care so it's just noise. Loud screechy misogynistic noise.
<p> I love this line: A,"We donA,,t believe women should have the right to choose, not even when theyA,,re 1) raped or 2) raped by a relative, but BristolA,,s decision to carry the baby to term is a choice worthy of the highest accolades.A,A_ Because the alternative is to believe she considered terminating the pregnancy, a sort of choice-for-me-but-not-for-thee situation, and if you believe that, youA,,re less pro-life than a pro-life hypocrite.
<p> Sarah Palin has a small Israeli flag hanging in her office in Juno, whereas Obama thinks having Che flags in one of his campaign offices is a better choice. I think that's because Sarah Palin is a decent human being and Obama surrounds himself with idiots.
<p> Hello. parallel universe people. Long time no see. Your flailing about is comical. DonA,,t you think your anger might be more productive directed at Sen McCain for putting you in this awkward and embarrassing position? Jeez, how much of his crap are you willing to eat?
<p> The spaghetti monster truck has backed up to the paper plate clutching swarm. They're hungry for their turn at the magic spaghetti and meme meatballs.
<p> This is more myth-driven than it's ever been. Former Moosetown mayor qualified for POTUS by rote of idealogy alone!
<p> Last time SEK dropped by, we got the equivalent arguement of all of the vile Leftist attacked on the Palin's are the fault of McCain for selecting her. He could have avoided this, but his actions put them in the line of fire.
<p> Really more of a reminder that your moral compass could use the occasional correction. Like in this instance presuming a position on someone that you made up out of the little caricatures of evil pro-lifers you have in your head.
<p> Last time SEK dropped by, we got the equivalent arguement of all of the vile Leftist attacked on the PalinA,,s are the fault of McCain for selecting her. He could have avoided this, but his actions put them in the line of fire.
<p> I was quite surprised he didn't drop by to do that the other day. Who was it took that standard up for him?
<p> It must be very troubling to have your leader dump one so squarely on your heads.
<p> But we don't consider this a "dump"! She a smart woman, she'll weather this well and peal a lot of votes off Obama, whose Teflon is on the wrong side of his political clothing.
<p> The left just doesn't get it (and hasn't since McGovern), and that is the amazing thing about it. The left's political perceptions repeatedly trump the concrete realities surrounding it: unemployment in Europe is at 10%-11%. Our is 5.4%
<p> The economy isn't miserable: it grew 3.3% last quarter, which is a flat 12% annualized growth rate;
<p> Gallup reprorts that Americans (I think it was about 20%)are uneasy about the future ("where the country is headed") but that 70% are confident financially and are fiscally optimistic.
<p> Oil is down $7/barrel today!
<p> And yet libs wander around in misery, trying to drag everyone else into their hell of high taxes, reduced liberty, and less of everything. Calling those who support choice of life over mere political convenience "hypocrites!" will only cause the majority of Americans to shake their heads, to sadly grin, and to say "There you go again," just before they decide things are pretty damn good after all, and vote Republican.
<p> Oh. That's probably true about outcomes but I'll have to think about that. But it still would have been someone else not me getting raped and some days that does or does not move the dial. I have end of the month reports to do, you see, and lunch sounds like it's going to be a tuna sub from the hepatitis Subway cause NG wants me to walk down there with her. Same as rape I think.
<p> That there's a fine compendium of Obama's down side, but here's his upside:
<p> 1) He gives a good speech 2) Voting for him will assuage our white liberal guilt for getting all the votes from the African-American community and then doing nothing for them 3) He is Ivy-League educated like all the REAL smart people are (You know, the ones who are your betters.)
<p> I would really like for the people who keep telling me Palin's opinions on abortion and sex education to provide just one fucking link to where they are getting their information. It has been five days now and I haven't seen source one.
<p> I'm fond of "Gravity's Gone." But that gets a little too blue in places for the RIGHTWING CHRISTIANISTS. So maybe something from The Carpenters.
<p> Oh, and Scott? Two things: putting up the child for adoption is another option. I know. I myself was adopted.
<p> Also, Bristol Palin is a different being from Sarah Palin, and -- being a teenager and her own person, could might have held different views from mom and dad. Not entirely unprecedented, you know -- even with all the "inscribing" and "dialogics of Alaska" shaping and controlling this poor gutter whore from Jack London's romantic socialist nightmares.
<p> IA,,m not sure whether this means you are applauding her for selecting the only available option or not, Ric.
<p> Are you familiar with the current law of the land, Scott? How about Alaskan abortion law in particular? Did you know that one's parents political positions and morals are not the same thing as state law?
<p> I like when SEK gets stupid. It's kind of rare, but it happens. I didn't know that Bristol was either 1)raped or 2) raped by a relative. That shit's dope, yo. Anyhow, kill em all, let the cray super computer sort em out.
<p> B Moe, one would think that if one thinks an executive is all powerful. And if one who thinks that also thinks Barack Obama ought to be the chief executive, well, you can see that they're going to be in for some big disappointments.
<p> Gross domestic product is a misunderstood statistic. Quarterly values (dollar value of all final goods and services) are annualized and percent changes from quarter to quarter are also annualized rates. The 3.3% increase in the second quarter was still respectable but it means that during that three month period, the economy was growing at a 3.3% annualized rate, not a 13.2% rate.
<p> A son and a brother of Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) are accused in two lawsuits of defrauding a former business partner and an investor of millions of dollars in a hedge fund deal that went sour, court records show.
<p> Granted, what with her being pregnant in the first place. But given PalinA,,s position on A,"the atrocity of abortion,A,A_ IA,,d wager a decision to terminate the pregnancy wouldnA,,t have been brooked.So you're saying that would have thrown her out of the house? Had her exorcised?
<p> And did she need to tell Mom and Dad at all?
<p> The "applause" you here is in response to those who say Sarah Palin is a bad mommy for allowing her daughter to get pregnant getting hit upside the head with Bristol Palin's own choice, one she didn't have to make.
<p> Again, she is not her parents -- and frankly, your suggestion that she was incapable of making up her own mind is yet an additional insult to women.
<p> That's sort of my point, Pablo. She only has the option to terminate the pregnancy because -- do I really need to finish this? It's not like groups praising her are doing so because she bravely decided not to give the child up for adoption:
<p> James Dobson, an influential Christian evangelical conservative, said his Focus on the Family group had always counseled young mothers to see their pregnancies through, "even though there will be of course challenges along the way."
<p> "That is what the Palins are doing, and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values, but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances," he said in a statement.
<p> Charmaine Yoest, head of Americans United for Life, said, "We join them in welcoming this new life."
<p> She only has the option to terminate the pregnancy because A,__ do I really need to finish this? ItA,,s not like groups praising her are doing so because she bravely decided not to give the child up for adoption:
<p> WTF?
<p> Does this make sense to anyone ? I'm including you in that question, SEK, because I'm leaving open the possibility you either phrased it clumsily or just lost your train of thought.
<p> Again, she is not her parents A,__ and frankly, your suggestion that she was incapable of making up her own mind is yet an additional insult to women.
<p> Yes, my statement that the 17-year-old daughter of a defiantly pro-life governor/VP-candidate might not consider abortion, though legal, an option suggests something about all women, as opposed to just 17-year-old-daughters-of-defiantly-pro-l\\...
<p> IA,,m applauding her for that, and for not having an abortion.
<p> I think you're in the majority there, but it's a strange position to be in if you're pro-life: you praise someone for doing what is to be done, akin to the expectations of the kid who thinks he deserves an "A" because he turned his essay in.
<p> Hello. parallel universe people. Long time no see. Your flailing about is comical. DonA,,t you think your anger might be more productive directed at Sen McCain for putting you in this awkward and embarrassing position?
<p> I'd have left it at "long time no see" mister david, and not have gone ahead and proved it like you did so, er, elegantly.
<p> I think youA,,re in the majority there, but itA,,s a strange position to be in if youA,,re pro-life: you praise someone for doing what is to be done, akin to the expectations of the kid who thinks he deserves an A,"AA,A_ because he turned his essay in.
<p> Again, do you know what my position is on the subject of abortion?
<p> And it's not all that unusual to applaud people for going ahead with the difficult choice, even if they believe it's the moral choice.
<p> Out of context A,"quotesA,A_ from left wing blogs. Thanks, Scott.
<p> If that's what you call direct answers to a questionnaire filled out during her gubernatorial campaign and administered by a conservative group -- that is, if you don't believe her own carefully worded answers, I'm not sure what will convince you.
<p> Does this make sense to anyone?
<p> Guess I do need to continue:
<p> The groups praising Bristol Palin's decision are praising her decision not to terminate the pregnancy. Dobson and the now-excited base are excited because McCain begrudgingly selected a pro-life running mate over Lieberman. Given that they're pro-life, and that this was a sticking-point in the selection of the VP, their decision to praise her for not doing what her mother, if she had her druthers, would criminalize is faint praise. If she chose to terminate the pregnancy, what would the reaction of the groups supporting her mother be?
<p> Here's an interesting anecdote. My wife's first reaction when Palin was named was, paraphrased "what the heck is this woman thinking in running for VP with 5 kids, one of them challenged?" We argued about that for a while and dropped it. Then the attacks started and now my wife would kill for Sarah Palin.Don't mess with mothers and most of the Evangelicals I know will be back Palin big time against these kinds of attacks.
<p> Nice job to David, SEK and their friends. OK, not you guys personally but those of your idealogical stripes have managed to energize Evangelical women to support McCain because of his vice president, empower moderate mothers to support a fellow mother and smear the entire Democratic Party by association with merciless attacks. Bravo!
<p> BTW: My wife is a pro-choice moderate career woman who's not that enamored of McCain but can't stand Obama even a little bit. She probably would have sat out the election but now is fired up to vote for McCain.
<p> Yes, my statement that the 17-year-old daughter of a defiantly pro-life governor/VP-candidate might not consider abortion, though legal, an option suggests something about all women, as opposed to just 17-year-old-daughters-of-defiantly-pro-l\\...
<p> Oh. So then it's just 17-year-old daughters of Alaskan pro-life governors who lack free will. Presumably because there's something intrinsic to one particular point of view on abortion that prevents opposition, and can never be pushed back against by defiant teenagers.
<p> If a teenager decides to abort, well, she obviously made this decision herself and should be commended for making a wise choice, but if she decides to keep the baby, she is obviously incapable of making a decision of her own with respect to abortion, or her parents are forcing her to keep the baby.
<p> I like Sarah cause she understands that we can drill our own energies. She's a bright lady and Democrats are stupid and want to keep giving monies to Hugo Chavez for oil we can make here, and create good jobs while doing it. I am the base that's fired up. Me. And I'm apathetic about abortions.
<p> People are arguing like it is known for sure that the pregnancy was an oops. Is it not possible that the girl chose to get pregnant? What if she did precisely that? Probably not the wisest choice is a lot what would be said, but hey, seventeen is not the wisest time of life anyhow.
<p> Doesn't the feminist left have enough respect for a seventeen year old woman to allow her to make her own choices? It's her womb, seems to me the lefties need to back off ans stop using her body as a weapon in the culture wars.
<p> I wonder if Scott worries about all those little hippie daughters of defiantly pro choice feminists who might not consider the option of having the baby because of their defiantly pro choice feminist parents?
<p> If youA,,re pro-life, applauding someone for not doing what you think should be outlawed is the faintest sort of praise.
<p> Not really, because they're (by and large) capable of distinguishing between the world as they wish it were and the world as it really is. In the real world, abortion's a legal option -- and Bristol still chose the more difficult, more responsible option.
<p> I know you're just trying to score rhetorical points, but if you'd attempt to understand that, you'd probably have a better understanding of the people you disagree with.
<p> Well, Scott, whatever the law might be in the future as a result of Sarah Palin's actions, it doesn't affect the law now or in the past (that's the "entropy" part) nor will it affect the difference between Alaska and the rest of the world (the "locality" part).
<p> Whatever Ms. Palin might prefer, the law in Alaska NOW is the same as it is in the rest of the country: abortion on demand, send the bill to the Feds. Bristol Palin had that choice, just like every other teenager. She chose differently -- but she DID have the choice, whatever her mother may prefer (which I don't address, since we're only concerned with what the insulting stereotype of Sarah Palin inside your head might prefer).
<p> Recognition of someone for choosing what one believes to be the morally correct path is now off-limits?
<p> Would you praise someone for not murdering the person who rear-ended them? Probably not, despite it being the morally correct decision.
<p> What does A,"is to be doneA,A_ mean?
<p> If Palin had her druthers, her daughter would have no choice but to carry the child to term. "Pride" doesn't seem the right word to attribute to a feeling more aptly described "thank you for not doing something morally reprehensible and contrary to my most sacred beliefs."
<p> Show me where I said she lacked free will. I pretty clearly stated that the ramifications of her terminating a pregnancy given her parent's position on the matter would be dire. That's not the same thing -- not even remotely, nor even suggestively -- as saying she has no free will.
<p> B Moe, it's the second link, which contains the material cited in the first. (You can also find it here , or could yesterday, although there seems to be an issue now.)
<p> The groups praising Bristol PalinA,,s decision are praising her decision not to terminate the pregnancy. Dobson and the now-excited base are excited because McCain begrudgingly selected a pro-life running mate over Lieberman.
<p> SEK, You might want to look at Dobson's entire statement before you pass it off as a political expediency:
<p> A,"In the 32-year history of Focus on the Family, we have offered prayer, counseling and resource assistance to tens of thousands of parents and children in the same situation the Palins are now facing. We have always encouraged the parents to love and support their children and always advised the girls to see their pregnancies through, even though there will of course be challenges along the way. That is what the Palins are doing, and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values, but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances.
<p> A,"Being a Christian does not mean youA,,re perfect. Nor does it mean your children are perfect. But it does mean there is forgiveness and restoration when we confess our imperfections to the Lord. IA,,ve been the beneficiary of that forgiveness and restoration in my own life countless times, as IA,,m sure the Palins have."
<p> Mercy and forgiveness, two practices quite lacking from those you keep defending. Also, your characterization of "defiantly" pro-life people is a cartoon. I happen to be one so I might know a thing or two.
<p> Until it is know with some certainty that this pregnancy was unplanned, and therefore 'abortion' was a viable question, then using this incident as ammunition in the abortion war is inappropriate and distasteful.
<p> - The Left should really try hard to stifle their panic and think this through.
<p> - By dumping all this gushing screeching on Bristol, aimed at marginalizing her mothers abilities to lead, they're sending an unmistakable message that it was always, from day one, never really about choice. The only real choice they will accept is abortion. So theres really no choice involved.
<p> - They hate and fear her because she made the wrong "outcome", not because she made the wrong choice.
<p> - Apparently they see Roe vs. Wade slipping through their fingers, and to them, if Bristol has her baby, its normal and healthy, she marries, and her and her husband raise the child in a normal happy family, they've made the wrong outcome, not the wrong choice, and it sends the wrong message that you can simply go ahead and multiply and be fruitful.
<p> Would you praise someone for not murdering the person who rear-ended them?
<p> I don't think I follow you. Bristol Palin was rear-ended by a...what? But if it were legal to kill someone who rear-ended you, and if it were really a great deal more convenient to do so than to deal with the police and the insurance companies and all, well, then...maybe.
<p> If Palin had her druthers, her daughter would have no choice but to carry the child to term. A,"PrideA,A_ doesnA,,t seem the right word to attribute to a feeling more aptly described A,"thank you for not doing something morally reprehensible and contrary to my most sacred beliefs.A,A_
<p> This is supposed to clarify what you meant by "to be done"? It doesn't.
<p> Also, you seem to imply that Bristol Palin could not have obtained an abortion without parental consent or knowledge. My ignorance of Alaskan state law in the matter is such that I have no idea whether you're right about that, so if that was indeed your intention to say something like that, please tell me why you think that's the case.
<p> I agree with you that Bristol's course of action probably won't merit anything like a Nobel prize, but it's nonetheless non-evil.
<p> Unless her parents are keeping her prisoner in the basement and using her uterus to make more Palins, that is.
<p> If thatA,,s what you call direct answers to a questionnaire filled out during her gubernatorial campaign and administered by a conservative group A,__ that is, if you donA,,t believe her own carefully worded answers, IA,,m not sure what will convince you.
<p> I pretty clearly stated that the ramifications of her terminating a pregnancy given her parentA,,s position on the matter would be dire.
<p> And there is that cartoon I spoke of. I'm guessing you don't spend a whole lot of time with conservative Christians of any kind other than the ones pilloried at kos, Huffpo and Pandagon. Dire? Like, what, they'd tar and feather her and parade her through the streets of Wasika to be clamped into the stocks and have a scarlet "A" tattooed into her forehead? Please, Scott, spare me the faux sniffing outrage of the academic at the snake handling God botherers. Unlike the reruns of "Inherit the Wind" playing in your head, the vast majority of pro lifers don't demonstrate at Abortion clinics and shun their children if they get pregnant. The only point being made by your use of words like "dire" and "defiantly" is to paint Palin and her husband as some kind of metaphorical pseudo Phelps and those who support them as minions applauding a "predestined" decision that was "no decision."
<p> You need to get out more, Scott. Pro lifers are people too, just like mechanics who want to be writers can make up stuff in Iraq, pre-traumatic stress disorder being an understudied affliction.
<p> The less virulent pro-life organizations that believe rape and incest are a valid reasons to terminate a pregnancy.
<p> First of all, let me qualify this by saying I am pro-choice to viability, and oppose anything after that. But the pro-life except in rape or incest seem the most disingenuous of all positions to me. If you believe life starts and conception, and abortion is murder, then how can you justify killing a child for the crimes of its parent(s)?
<p> And, you know? What's the largest demographic for unwed teenaged pregnancy brought to term, anyway? I really, really like those single teen moms getting a look behind the curtain of smiling condescension they experience all the time.
<p> It's what I responded to because it's all I've heard about this afternoon.
<p> Not really, because theyA,,re (by and large) capable of distinguishing between the world as they wish it were and the world as it really is. In the real world, abortionA,,s a legal option A,__ and Bristol still chose the more difficult, more responsible option.
<p> I get this, but given the strength of people's convictions on this particular issue, it's odd to praise someone for not doing something legal-but-immoral.
<p> Also, it should be noted, I think this a matter of random debate on the internet, not anything more. I find the hypocrisy -- disingenuous quality of the praise -- amusing in itself, not politically revealing or relevant.
<p> Until it is know with some certainty that this pregnancy was unplanned, and therefore A,EoabortionA,, was a viable question, then using this incident as ammunition in the abortion war is inappropriate and distasteful.
<p> Thomas, you make a fine point here, but then the debate would shift to whether you believe someone just this side of statutory rape laws is fit to be a parent. (Note: I'm not testing those waters, merely pointing at the lake.)
<p> You might want to look at DobsonA,,s entire statement before you pass it off as a political expediency
<p> I wasn't passing it off as political expediency -- in fact, I was saying it's exactly the opposite. Abortion's one of those issues in which a person's depth of belief is unassailable, so when a person for whom abortion-is-murder praises someone for not terminating a pregnancy, it's disingenuous in the extreme.
<p> The Left should really try hard to stifle their panic and think this through.
<p> I've seen this mentioned, but "the" Left -- be it liberals, leftists, socialists, marxists, anarchists, Democrats, whatever -- is stifling laughter , not panic. If you're the sort of person enthused by McCain's decision, this might be difficult to see, but it's true nonetheless. Consider this: when the scandal broke, Obama was able to benefit from it in such a way as to merit praise from his opposition. That's a win-win scenario for him, a lose-lose one for McCain.
<p> I am endlessly amused that for all the vitriol on the left, who is it we are talking about? It ain't Obama. McCain hit a homerun with this pick. You guys on the left are just pissed because Palin isn't an ivy leaguer. I wish I had a dime for every friend who is a liberal who has sent me that email talking about all the different jobs a homemaker has done and their payscales. This is just proof they have zero respect for hardworking people. Governor Palin, tear this wall down.
<p> It does. He's changed his positions because, you know, he's a politician. As opposed to McCain who only opposes bills with his name on -- but wait, I got distracted there. Any indication Palin's changed her position since she filled out that questionnaire?
<p> BJTexs, I get out plenty, and not only know people who belong to Assemblies of God, I'm related to them . I was even married in their church by one of their pastors . They're good people, no doubt. But asking me to stay out of your head, then informing me of the films I'm screening in mine sort of undermines your point. Just a little, though.
<p> First of all, let me qualify this by saying I am pro-choice to viability, and oppose anything after that. But the pro-life except in rape or incest seem the most disingenuous of all positions to me. If you believe life starts and conception, and abortion is murder, then how can you justify killing a child for the crimes of its parent(s)? Sorry, you canA,,t have it both ways.
<p> B Moe, we're in agreement here. I find it impossible to think my way out of that one, and am only comforted by the fact that the decision to terminate is made quickly after the pregnancy is noticed in cases of rape -- I don't know the numbers as to incest, but I'm sure they'd depress me.
<p> AbortionA,,s one of those issues in which a personA,,s depth of belief is unassailable, so when a person for whom abortion-is-murder praises someone for not terminating a pregnancy, itA,,s disingenuous in the extreme.
<p> Wha? So if you praise someone for doing what you think was the right thing you are being "disingenuous?" What should they have done? Maybe just STFU? Goodness, Scott, are only liberals allowed to praise and extol the young mother who ends her pregnancy rather than foist another child on an overburdened world?
<p> You may have spent time around AoG churches but you still don't know squatini about pro-lifers.
<p> So you are using defiantly as a complement? Because that is how I feel about it, I may disagree with her opinion, but I believe it to be an honest one and will defend her right to advocate it. Defiantly.
<p> Implicit in Scott's discussion of the situation is an assumption so fundamental that he, himself, may not be aware of it: The only possible rational decision for Bristol Palin was to have an abortion. Since she did not do so, the only possible explanation is that she was somehow coerced.
<p> She could not possibly have chosen to bring the child to term, because she chose to have it aborted and was forced not to do so. The more you argue against that proposition, the louder Scott will get in defending it. That's because it's another Revealed TRVTH, not subject to "debate": in Scott's world, the only possible thing to do with a fetus is have the doctor kill and remove it, and send the bill to the Feds. Clearly Bristol wanted to do that, but was forced not to, and that's the end of the story -- it has been Decided.
<p> 122- Apparently they see Roe vs. Wade slipping through their fingers, and to them, if Bristol has her baby , its normal and healthy, she marries, and her and her husband raise the child in a normal happy family, theyA,,ve made the wrong outcome, not the wrong choice, and it sends the wrong message that you can simply go ahead and multiply and be fruitful.
<p> Its like a cheap, straight-to-video Horror movie about the end of the world. Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme "Must STOP the baby!!!1!"
<p> Scott, you seem to be making a case for that this is a scandal for the McCain-Palin campaign.
<p> I don't see this as a scandal at all. I think it points to something scandalous -- McCain's decision to vet his VP candidate after-the-fact -- but in my book, there's nothing but a little bemusement to be had at the expense of Dobson and his ilk.
<p> I am endlessly amused that for all the vitriol on the left, who is it we are talking about? It ainA,,t Obama.
<p> You must not be watching and reading the same things I am, because Fox has Obama's statement about families being off-limits in heavy rotation.
<p> CouldnA,,t be this entire pile of steaming hypocrisy is simply because of her moms party affiliation, now could it?
<p> Explain again: How is it hypocritical to laugh at people who are, in essence, saying "we should praise this girl for deciding not to participate in what we believe is a genocide"? Because I'm not seeing it.
<p> That sound you just heard was the last bit of ScottA,,s credibility crashing through the floor into the cellar.
<p> Or would have, had I not qualified it right there in next sentence. I'm not saying the slope is slippery-fine so let's all slide down! I'm just not denying it's there. Because it is -- parental consent and statutory laws are the very next stop down that hill. (And I take it BBH agrees .)
<p> But asking me to stay out of your head, then informing me of the films IA,,m screening in mine sort of undermines your point. Just a little, though.
<p> Absolutely not, Scott, as you are the one applying some kind of experiential montage to the Palins by insisting that their daughter really didn't have any choice based upon her mother's answers to a political questionnaire and all of the dire consequences that await her! You were never in my head but represented yourself as in the head of the Palins with no more"experience" than an answered political list. your use of language indicates a skewed attitude that brooks no interference as it screeches towards the conclusion of pro-lifers being "disingenuous" and opposition to abortion being "defiant."
<p> Therefore I reiterate that there is some kind of film playing in your head that is coloring your conclusions and creating a cartoonist meme on pro lifers in general and the Palins in particular.
<p> CHICAGO (AP) -- The daughter of Sen. Joseph Biden ( news, bio, voting record), D-Del., was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of obstructing a police officer early Saturday, police said. Ashley Blazer Biden, 21, of Wilmington, Del., was with a group of people on a North Side street where several bars are located when someone else threw a bottle at a police officer, police said. When officers went to arrest another person, Biden blocked the officer's path and made intimidating statements, Officer JoAnn Taylor said. Biden was arrested on suspicion of obstructing a police officer. She was released from custody and is scheduled to appear in court Sept. 20. Sen. Biden's spokeswoman, Margaret Aitken, declined to comment Saturday, calling it a private, family matter.
<p> ric, as usual nailed it. Scott wouldn't be talking about "dire" consequences and "defiantly" stated points of views if we were having a nice, progressive conversation about the triumph of choice in an unwed teen ending her pregnancy. I'd have to argue that her parents were "defiantly" prop choice and would have created "dire" results if their daughter had chosen to keep the baby.
<p> Implicit in ScottA,,s discussion of the situation is an assumption so fundamental that he, himself, may not be aware of it: The only possible rational decision for Bristol Palin was to have an abortion. Since she did not do so, the only possible explanation is that she was somehow coerced.
<p> I'm trying to figure out how this could be even more wronger, but I'm coming up empty. Because yes, obviously, I believe all fetuses should be aborted so that America might win the extinction sweepstakes!
<p> You canA,,t say you arenA,,t going to say something after you just said it, Scott.
<p> Take it up with Big Bang Hunter, as he actually said it. I simply said "It's the next logical step in this conversation."
<p> your use of language indicates a skewed attitude that brooks no interference as it screeches towards the conclusion of pro-lifers being A,"disingenuousA,A_ and opposition to abortion being A,"defiant.A,A_
<p> Notice how both David and SEK are very carefully avoiding commenting on anything close to the point of Jeff's post? Not to mention how they've succeeded in steering the comments thread away from the same?
<p> So what we have witnessed in the MSM over the past 24 hours, where pundit after pundit has been "applauding" Obama for saying that family matters are off limits, is nothing more than faint praise- because what choice did he really have? Right?
<p> You guys will be lucky if the worst that happens is an Obama defeat, rather than a full-fledged move to the political scrapheap along with the Free Soilers and the Know-Nothings.
<p> A couple of facts to chew on:
<p> 1) Hillary's brother has been meeting with McCain. I don't think she's getting over it, do you? 2) VP-nominee speeches are usually yawn-fests with approximately the same ratings as a Les Nessman hog report. Not this one. The entire nation is going to be glued to their sets, thanks to you and yours! Imagine how grateful Obama must be! 3) McCain's media team has been en fuego , working YouTube like masters. That, to me, has been the biggest surprise of this election cycle.
<p> John McCain is so far inside Obama's OODA loop that he's practically flying up Obama's ass.
<p> The only question is whether it's going to be a 1968-level humiliation or a 1972-level bitchslapping.
<p> You're doing a heckuva job, Barry!
<p> Personally, I don't think Obama ever planned on getting this far -- he was probably shooting for building brand recognition with an eye toward a serious run in 2012. When his pre-planned script ran out he simply got stuck.
<p> Hello. parallel universe people. Long time no see. Your flailing about is comical. DonA,,t you think your anger might be more productive directed at Sen McCain for putting you in this awkward and embarrassing position? Jeez, how much of his crap are you willing to eat?"
<p> Bull, Scott. The only way to make your objections make any sense whatever is if one assumes that, had she not been pressured, Bristol Palin would have obviously made the decision to abort. Since she did not make the decision to abort, obviously she was pressured, and (here's a free meme for you) complimenting people for giving in to pressure cancels any compliments due to McCain for withstanding the pressure of being tortured.
<p> Or, Hell, you can go back and fisk your own posts. How 'bout it: where is the narrow little gap wherein we can edge the notion that Bristol Palin might have chosen not to abort even in the absence of coercion? If it's there, you'll have to point it out; it certainly isn't visible at first glance.
<p> It is the single least attractive, most frustrating feature of dealing with leftoids. They claim to be "multicultural"; in fact they are the most bigoted jingoists on the planet, because their assumption is that their set of notions is biological or perhaps physics, shared by every animate being on the planet and ninety percent of the stuffed ones. Any deviation from the behavior of an obscure professor of fuzzy studies at some mid-range university in the US, Canada, or England can only be because of villainy (deliberately behaving in ways they know to be wrong, i.e. different from those of SEK and Prof. Caricature), coercion (villains, already defined, compelling misbehavior), or insanity. There is nobody on the planet who does not agree with SEK; there are just some who pretend not to.
<p> It wasn't attractive in 1964, and it hasn't mellowed with age. In my heart, I know he's full of shit.
<p> Notice how both David and SEK are very carefully avoiding commenting on anything close to the point of JeffA,,s post?
<p> Not "carefully," but willfully and brazenly .
<p> and how dare you ever acknowledge or praise someone for doing what you believe is right. itA,,s disingenuous.
<p> For the record: You also won't be receiving an "A" on that paper just because you turned it in. Competence -- or basic compliance -- isn't praiseworthy.
<p> 4.2 million dollars of donations poured into McCain campaign coffers in the 24 hours after her nomination for VP.
<p> I suppose I should be quaking, what with the entirely unpredictable happening -- unless, of course, the fact that McCain's choice panders to those in the base who'd only grudgingly supported him before he put Palin on the ticket, and they decided to contribute. Maybe his $47M August will top Obama's $50M June or July. Wait, it can't do that. Maybe it'll top his August tally. (And we'll remember that breaking this up into months is sort of arbitrary, like the hitter who's .500 in his last twenty AB but is still sporting a cool .230 on the season.)
<p> Seriously, I love the counter-narrative. Sure, McCain's infighting with party brass over his potential VP is a sign that ALL IS HEALTHY AND WELL WITHIN THE PARTY. The fact that neither Bush nor Cheney will attend the convention is a sign that ALL IS HEALTHY AND WELL WITHIN THE PARTY. Bush's unpopularity won't reflect poorly on McCain, though, because he's a maverick, not like Bush at all. Good thing they don't have film of McCain's saying he's voted with Bush 90 percent of the -- what? Well, crap .
<p> Bull, Scott. The only way to make your objections make any sense whatever is if one assumes that, had she not been pressured, Bristol Palin would have obviously made the decision to abort. Since she did not make the decision to abort, obviously she was pressured, and (hereA,,s a free meme for you) complimenting people for giving in to pressure cancels any compliments due to McCain for withstanding the pressure of being tortured.
<p> Well said, Ric.
<p> What is unsaid is that Scott assumes he knows what conversation Miss Palin had with her parents and the details of that conversation.
<p> He can guess, and if he was honest, state that he is speculating. But he assumes he knows what was said between three people, none of whom have confided in him. He doesn't know anymore than any of us here do what was said. All that we have are the facts that Miss Palin is pregnant and intends to carry the child to term and marry the father. From that meager collection of information he erects an entire edifice, on a foundation more unstable than Swamp Castle's.
<p> Yet the edifice is erected to do what? To use a seventeen-year old as a political cudgel.
<p> I think it is pretty low to use this seventeen year-old girl as a political cudgel.
<p> I know, everyone should take the path Limbaugh paved with Chelsea and -- wait, scratch that. Maybe everyone should follow Bill O'Reilly's lead on teen pregnancy and not blame the parents -- wait, that one's a no-go too. Well then, how about we complain about the way Obama's berating Palin for not raising her daughter -- nevermind. How about we just whine because the GOP's VP selection is a mistake of Quaylian proportions? Good idea, that.
<p> There's a sort of inevitable arc of development quality to SEK's appearance here -- any moment now we should be treated to a hypothetical in which a well-known and notorious roustabout becomes pregnant....
<p> I stand by my earlier assessment regarding your moral compass, because you seem to find something wrong (or at least humorous) about praising an act that is legal yet immoral. Let me clear up any misunderstanding you may have on this issue; The praise is a good thing because it seeks to encourage more of the same behavior. I'm a little surprised such an easy one would slip by you, unless of course you are more interested in political points than actual truth or morality.
<p> I think she's a great choice, Scott. We need a Washington outsider to bring Hope and Change I think. Also she can help McCain understand that there's oil in Alaska. For real. It's under ground where you can't see it, but there's like TONS of it.
<p> so youA,,re sticking with A,"she had no other choiceA,A_??? make up your mind, please.
<p> I'm sticking own-petard-hoisting, with a side of schadenfreude, thank you very much.
<p> The only way to make your objections make any sense whatever is if one assumes that, had she not been pressured, Bristol Palin would have obviously made the decision to abort.
<p> Not in the least. All it assumes is that the language of "choice" is disingenuous coming from the mouth of someone who would force women to carry a child to term even if they've been raped or raped by relatives. I don't need to know any of the particulars to find high irony in her choice of words, i.e. in a situation in which carrying the baby to term is the only option, like the one her mother favors, there'd be no choice to her choice. I don't have to presume anything about her actual decision-making process to comment on the ideal-but-hypothetical situation in which no decision would be made.
<p> The rest of your comment -- what with its bogeyman professors who take their communist colonics so powerful they leak marxism from both ears -- is pure noise and doesn't merit a response.
<p> Hello. parallel universe people. Long time no see. Your flailing about is comical. DonA,,t you think your anger might be more productive directed at Sen McCain for putting you in this awkward and embarrassing position? Jeez, how much of his crap are you willing to eat?A,A_
<p> All it assumes is that the language of A,"choiceA,A_ is disingenuous coming from the mouth of someone who would force women to carry a child to term even if theyA,,ve been raped or raped by relatives. I donA,,t need to know any of the particulars to find high irony in her choice of words, i.e. in a situation in which carrying the baby to term is the only option, like the one her mother favors, thereA,,d be no choice to her choice. I donA,,t have to presume anything about her actual decision-making process to comme yada yada yada ...
<p> That's because you don't accept the basic premises of those who are "pro-life." That it is a life.
<p> Thing is, Scott, you don't have to turn the paper in. You have a right to not turn in the paper. If you had to turn the paper in, there would be no justice. In fact, we should have Federal programs to ensure that you aren't forced to turn the paper in.
<p> So, if you turn the paper in nowadays, it's for extra credit. Congratulations. I'm proud of you.
<p> "Good thing they donA,,t have film of McCainA,,s saying heA,,s voted with Bush 90 percent of the A,__ what?"
<p> - Hey you know, thats right. Lets see who else did that. Oh, Biden did too, and Obama. Well in Obama's case when he bothered to vote at all.
<p> - Does that mean if Obiden gets elected it would be four more years of Booooosh?
<p> - This meme is one of those arguments that looks important, until you actually look at the record. Then it turns out, on those very few occasion that Congress gets anything done, it only happens when both Dems and Reps vote for it.
<p> Show me where I said she lacked free will. I pretty clearly stated that the ramifications of her terminating a pregnancy given her parentA,,s position on the matter would be dire. ThatA,,s not the same thing A,__ not even remotely, nor even suggestively A,__ as saying she has no free will.
<p> The no-free-will thing was pretty clearly pointed, Scott, because -- as others have pointed out -- to your way of thinking she really had no other choice.
<p> Your argument was a loser, but like any good academic, you'll hang on, looking for a reversal. Unfortunately, you're not applying the lessons of Mamet's Redbelt soundly, so I don't see it happening.
<p> Other than that, I'm surprised to see you throw in the talking point about the McCain campaign "just now beginning to vet" Palin. Rethuglicans are big on vast oil conspiracies and (to some minds, blowing up levees), but they aren't savvy enough to vet a candidate before naming her?
<p> Goodness, but that's sad, Scott.
<p> But I don't doubt you when you say you're "laughing" at the pick; after all, Palin doesn't have the requisite pedigree, as far as you're concerned. Unfortunately, you represent a very small contingent of progressive snobs and wannabe wonks. So it's quite possible your laughter might wind up drowned out by the cheers of all those dullards who spend time raising kids and doing the PTA thing, starting businesses and going to youth hockey games, tailgating with friends and going into government not as a bureaucratic lifer, but rather because somebody needed to fight those who are.
<p> ThereA,,s a sort of inevitable arc of development quality to SEKA,,s appearance here -- any moment now we should be treated to a hypothetical in which a well-known and notorious roustabout becomes pregnantA,A
<p> Yes, there is, which is why I don't appear all that often. There's a, how do you say it? Pile on effect, whereby for every one comment I write fifteen people respond, then if I don't respond to each and every one of them, Darleen whines.
<p> The praise is a good thing because it seeks to encourage more of the same behavior.
<p> You're not getting it, EG. I'm talking 1) about Palin's policy position and 2) the reaction to Bristol's decision by like-minded advocacy groups. Sure, I see the value of the praise, but that doesn't mean I also don't see the irony behind it. Because I do.
<p> I think sheA,,s a great choice, Scott. We need a Washington outsider to bring Hope and Change I think. Also she can help McCain understand that thereA,,s oil in Alaska.
<p> You're not alone in this, happy, but that still doesn't change the fact that, in the end, her selection will have been a mistake. According to McCain's own criteria, she's not fit to lead, doesn't know squat about foreign affairs, &c. She's a desperate, blustering appeal to the base because the RNC wouldn't let McCain have his first two choices (Leiberman and Ridge).
<p> The RNC has about 5 times as much cash on hand as the DNC, and McCain is going to get an extra $84 million from public financing (which Obama isnA,,t).
<p> And he'll have the spending restrictions that go with it -- and it'll be divvied up to support Republican candidates in crucial districts -- and Obama will have no such restrictions -- nor will he have to divvy his war-chest up. There's a reason McCain's started the attack ads so early: once he accepts the nomination, he'll have his $84M and the RNC chest and that'll be it.
<p> Had McCain chosen either Ridge or Lieberman, he wouldn't be getting the reaction he's getting. Sure, some social cons would be happy; but who's really energized by the Palin pick are right-leaning libertarians, classical liberals, small-government reform types, legal conservatives, and even a notable contingency of Dems who came away from the primary process feeling that Bros Before Hos might wind up as the motto on the Obama $12 bill...
<p> For instance, I'm well documented in my disdain for McCain. But I love the Palin pick. And I'm hardly the constituency you seem to want to pin Palin to -- which appears to be a caricature of rightwing religious fanatics. Maybe it's the fish...
<p> You wouldn't be predicting her albatrosseyness if you didn't fear her appeal I don't think. She can't never be Dan Quayle cause she has charisma. NPR will have to slap the bitch upside her stupid bitch head with entirely new memes what they'll have to make up.
<p> I like Scott. He always defends himself against my objections in the same way: first he gives a concrete example of what I object to, then he claims it doesn't exist.
<p> FYI, SEK: Down here amongst the trailer trash, marriage customs are getting almost Icelandic. We make the assumption that regardless of reality, justice, or the welfare of anyone concerned, some judge is gonna declare that the woman gets all the money, so the neatest way out is just to never get married. That isn't the majority, yet, but it's getting there.
<p> Q: How is divorce court like a tornado? A: Some redneck's about to lose a trailer.
<p> Palin & CO. are from the upper, sophisticated end of that demographic. They know perfectly well the girl could've gotten an abortion at any time, as does she, and the ramifications would be dire, dire I tell ya -- Hell, Sarah might've said "I'm awful disappointed, honey." Crushing. You have mixed the customs up with those of your clients, the horribly misunderstood and maltreated Muslims.
<p> I'm not getting it because I understand that Bristol, who is 17 and as such deserves praise for moral choices, is not her mother, who has outgrown the need for them. Were you aware that they are 2 separate individuals?
<p> Unfortunately, you represent a very small contingent of progressive snobs and wannabe wonks. So itA,,s quite possible your laughter might wind up drowned out by the cheers of all those dullards who spend time raising kids and doing the PTA thing, starting businesses and going to youth hockey games, tailgating with friends and going into government not as a bureaucratic lifer, but rather because somebody needed to fight those who are.
<p> I suppose I don't have my pulse on the people like you do, Jeff. But your Norman Rockwell caricature is convincing on its face, even though its tone is just this side of Tweek's dad:
<p> Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee so very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt.
<p> You know why I like Palin? Because she is an ACTUAL outsider. She's a REAL person, not a life-long politician. She's not a lawyer-turned politician. Plus, she didn't pull herself-up from her husband's bootstraps. Hello Pelosi. Hillary. Monica Conyers.
<p> IA,,m talking 1) about PalinA,,s policy position and 2) the reaction to BristolA,,s decision by like-minded advocacy groups.
<p> and 3) demonstrating that you don't really understand either of those.
<p> You know, you might want to get out of your office and meet some normal, working-class people every once in a while. The ones who own small businesses (and pay taxes), who like to hunt and fish, who don't really approve of abortion, but still worry about their teenage daughters falling pregnant.
<p> It's educational, I promise! You'll be surprised at how little overlap there is between the real working class and Marx's lumpenproletariat.
<p> If you simply can't face those awful, awful people in person, Bourdieu came closer than most to explaining them in an academically-acceptable way.
<p> You wouldnA,,t be predicting her albatrosseyness if you didnA,,t fear her appeal I donA,,t think.
<p> This really, really isn't the case. Reading here and Patterico today's been an education. I mean, Jeff's going on and on about classical liberals and libertarians loving the Palin pick, while classical liberals and libertarians are gathering some 10,000 strong in a counter-convention. I'm sure the cognitive dissonance is on my end, really, but to me it looks like so much wish-casting.
<p> And still not even a glimmer on SEK's part of a response to the overwhelming misogyny his ideological brethren are directing at Palin and her daughter. Apparently that's something that can't be addressed even "brazenly and willfully."
<p> That unprecedented GOP popularity had a precedent: Jimmy Carter He was so awful, so inexperienced, so overmatched by the job that he got drummed out of office ASAP. Jimmy Carter's thin 1976 resume outpaces Barack Obama's sum of life experience... and Palins job experience kicks the crap out of Baracks.
<p> Barack got a shot in today at Palin's stint as mayor and played up his experience at.... get this now.. running his campaign. Huh. Alaska must be a bigger place than the Barack campaign what with the $11B budget and all. Oh. There was that executive experience handing out $100M of grant money to Ayres' maoist buddies and generally getting nothing for the money...
<p> - I see the Husband had a fishing license infraction a few decades ago. This definately smacks of the stink of political Cod. The NYT should do a hard hitting investigation into his fitness to be a father.
<p> You know, you might want to get out of your office and meet some normal, working-class people every once in a while. The ones who own small businesses (and pay taxes), who like to hunt and fish, who donA,,t really approve of abortion, but still worry about their teenage daughters falling pregnant.
<p> Christ almighty, first Jeff, now you? Look, the appeal of your rose-tinted caricature of "decent, hard-working folk" borders on offensive. I know, you speak for them, know their interest, are them , whereas I'm not, and you know that because ... because !
<p> You disingenuous ass.
<p> Rob, I kindly invite you to read BBH's comment , the one in which he jumps recklessly into that very lake. For one, it proves I wasn't being disingenuous -- I really do believe that's the next move in the discussion -- but moreover, it proves that I'm correct inasmuch as my belief was validated by a subsequent comment. Seriously, if pointing out the obvious direction in which discussions of Type A or B move makes one an ass, well then, I suppose I'm an ass. Note, though, that I'm not now -- nor am I ever -- the one who resorts to childish name-calling.
<p> Scott, all that's in your head. All you're doing is lowering her debate expectations for her really. But people will see her and like her. You know that. She is very likeable. Joe Biden is not likeable. The media people what ask questions at debates? Not likeable. Sarah P is like in NASCAR when a car laps another car. Whatever you call it. Way ahead of the game.
<p> Because I grew up in a working class home. Because I worked for a living (as in "paid my own bills and bought my own home" not "worked at the espresso shop to pay for concert tickets") before I went to grad school.
<p> "I mean, JeffA,,s going on and on about classical liberals and libertarians loving the Palin pick, while classical liberals and libertarians are gathering some 10,000 strong in a counter-convention. IA,,m sure the cognitive dissonance is on my end, really, but to me it looks like so much wish-casting."
<p> - You wish to tell us how we feel it seems. You don't like how we feel, so we should feel like you say we should.
<p> - Let me know how that works out for you. You may be on to something there.
<p> And still not even a glimmer on SEKA,,s part of a response to the overwhelming misogyny his ideological brethren are directing at Palin and her daughter.
<p> Just because I'm the only liberal here doesn't mean I'm responsible for every single thing my "ideological brethren" do . Really, it doesn't. I mean, you could -- and, in the past, have -- spend all day listing the topics I haven't addressed, then call me dishonest for not addressing them, but you know how much fun that is? (Hint: Not at all.) I don't feel obliged to respond to each and every complaint you have about Democrats, liberals, leftists, communists, Marxists, and every other group you're too ignorant to know the difference between. Not "you" in particular, M.O., but the general "you" who spew idiocies like "Obama's a socialist," when, in fact, if said person knew anything about socialism (other that "it is bad, you know") they'd know Obama's far to the right of the average socialist, and that his support for the watered-down socialist institutions of the New Deal doesn't quite dovetail with actual socialist belief.
<p> And still not even a glimmer on SEKA,,s part of a response to the overwhelming misogyny his ideological brethren are directing at Palin and her daughter. Apparently thatA,,s something that canA,,t be addressed even A,"brazenly and willfully.A,A_"
<p> Ron Paul has more experience than Barack, and he's got a stutter when cornered just like Barack does. Of the two stutters, I will say Barack's is the more refined, but you can tell he is buying time to lie or twist the narrative, while Paul is just barking like a flummoxed chihuahua
<p> It's true that you don't have to answer for every statement and action of those with whom you identify, SEK, but is it really so unfair to suggest that in the comments to a post whose driving theme is the blatant and disgusting misogyny that the political left is directing towards Palin, that you, as a self-identified member of that same political faction, might at least touch on that subject?
<p> And, while Palin might not meet McCain's standard for CiC, she's not been appointed to run for that position. Whereas Obama... Well, Hillary took care of that little bit of business for us during the primaries.
<p> Finally, while I know it's de rigeur to reduce any kind of pastiche of middle Americana to "Rockwellesque," such self-conscious irony doesn't get rid of the actual referents. You know, the people that New Yorker cover with Obama in the White House was "not really intended for."
<p> Or to put it another way, your disapproving of the description does not make the demographic any less real.
<p> Because of your smarmy ass Norman Rockwell snark. You donA,,t want to come across as an elitist snob then donA,,t act like one.
<p> I'm not the one who's reducing America to a Norman Rockwell painting or a Sanka ad here, just pointing out that people who are and know working-class people see that pablum for the bullshit it is. It's condescension -- the faux-populism of picket fences. Is it elitist of me to point that out?
<p> Because I grew up in a working class home. Because I worked for a living (as in A,"paid my own bills and bought my own homeA,A_ not A,"worked at the espresso shop to pay for concert ticketsA,A_) before I went to grad school. You?
<p> Christ, is this what it's descended to? "Only the Volk can know the pain of the Volk"? My background is Southern and solidly working-class. I've attended only state schools -- no Harvard, Hopkins or Cornell for me -- but you know what? This is a bullshit line of inquiry, so I'm going to call shenanigans before you force me to point out that by these standards, no man can speak about abortion because he's never been pregnant, or whatever other identitarian idiocy you'd like to trot out.
<p> I mean, JeffA,,s going on and on about classical liberals and libertarians loving the Palin pick, while classical liberals and libertarians are gathering some 10,000 strong in a counter-convention. IA,,m sure the cognitive dissonance is on my end, really, but to me it looks like so much wish-casting.
<p> Yeah. I hear some Hillary supporters are still going to vote for Obama, too -- so the fact that many others are crossing over is of no moment.
<p> One reason not to contact the Alaska GOP is to limit the number of people who know that she is being vetted, which helps to avoid leaks. This is important not only because you want to be able to vet the candidate without press and/or public interference, but also can help to prevent embarrassment/speculation for those who don't make the cut for whatever reason.
<p> Yeah, this isn't the first time you've taken the "I'm not sayin'... I'm just sayin'..." tack. You're still a disingenuous ass. You're the same fellow who got pissed when Jeff pointed out the foul comments some of your brethren on the left made, claiming the timing of pointing the foulness out was as bad as the actual foulness.
<p> IA,,m not the one whoA,,s reducing America to a Norman Rockwell painting or a Sanka ad here,
<p> Yes by God you are. You are the only one who brought it up, just like you brought up the "almost statutory rape" horseshit and then said you didn't.
<p> just pointing out that people who are and know working-class people see that pablum for the bullshit it is. ItA,,s condescension A,__ the faux-populism of picket fences. Is it elitist of me to point that out?
<p> It was elitist of you to bring it up in the first place, it is frankly kind of bone-headed to point it out, it was already plain as day to the rest of us.
<p> When I was in college I read Sinclair LewisA,, Elmer Gantry . It wasnA,,t required, I just read it. Elmer was an evangelical fire-and-brimstone preacher. Elmer preached all of the virtues, but never lived them. So it was a tale of hypocrisy. What are we to take from the novel?
<p> What I took was this: Elmer was scum, likable scum, but still scum. What does that say about the virtues he preached? Nothing.
<p> What?????
<p> The virtues are the message. They do not get their value because of the worthiness of the messenger, they are valuable in and of themselves. The fact that the messenger is a real moral sewer doesnA,,t devalue the message. As an example: let us suppose there is a person who states the value of patriotism, loyalty, and duty. It turns out that this person is a traitor. Does that mean patriotism, loyalty, and duty are not valuable and should not be upheld merely because this prominent person has turned out to be a traitor? The answer is no -- patroitism, loyalty, and duty are good despite how a particular messenger has acted.
<p> The messenger is trading on the worth of the message, trying to feed off its worth. The message is providing the worth to the messenger , not vice-versa. Having high ideals, advocating high ideals means that at some point you will fall short of those ideals. It says all about you when you do fall short, it does not speak to the worth of the ideals. They are worthy and exist whether you advocate them or acknowledge them in the breaking of them. And when you cease to exist, those ideals will still be there. That is because they are ideals .
<p> Remember that piece of commonsense when reading of Gov. PalinA,,s daughter.
<p> Oh. And I'm not really sure how what I described was "working class," either. Let me revisit:
<p> Unfortunately, you represent a very small contingent of progressive snobs and wannabe wonks. So itA,,s quite possible your laughter might wind up drowned out by the cheers of all those dullards who spend time raising kids and doing the PTA thing, starting businesses and going to youth hockey games, tailgating with friends and going into government not as a bureaucratic lifer, but rather because somebody needed to fight those who are.
<p> Would those be her political opponents? The ones whose apple carts she upset?
<p> By dint of the AWESOME POWER of her REFORM, she managed to alienate every single Republican politician in the state of Alaska . Every last one of them. (Except for Stevens , with whom she remained chummy.)
<p> And are you getting this information from the same press that reported Palin was in a secessionist party based on a single source, without bothering to actually talk to Palin herself?
<p> She wasn't a member, she only pandered to their "Alaska First" message. All the better.
<p> And, while Palin might not meet McCainA,,s standard for CiC, sheA,,s not been appointed to run for that position. Whereas Obama A,A Well, Hillary took care of that little bit of business for us during the primaries.
<p> The way I see it, only former Presidents are qualified to be Presidents; or maybe I mean Governors, only Governors and former Presidents; or maybe Mayors, only Mayors, Governors, and Presidents (former or otherwise) are qualified to be President. That being the case, VOTE MCCAIN!
<p> Apparently Sara Palin is a horrible mother because her 17 year old daughter is preggers. I have an anecdote I'd like to share:
<p> My mother was 19 when she had me. In her wedding pictures I am very visibly present. She sacrificed her college career and lots of parties to a young son and her husband. But then, instead of inconsolably bemoaning her wasted life, she received a nursing degree in Night School once I entered grade school. By the time I hit high school in the 80?s she was able to get a Masters in Business Administration (in her 30?s no less!). She now *runs* several hospital ER's in the Pacific Northwest.
<p> According to Barak Obama and his ideological ilk, I'm a mistake and my mothers life was wasted because she didn't follow the advice of many of her friends and get an abortion.
<p> As for "Alaska first," well, so long as she wasn't a secessionist, that just marks her as a federalist of sorts. Libertarians and classical liberal types tend to like those.
<p> Oh. And "pander"? Here's what I get from your link, with the "pander" bolded:
<p> Questions had swirled about Sarah Palin's affiliation with the Independence Party and with former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. Voter registration records and past news reports, however, show Palin never registered as a member of the Independence Party, and backed Steve Forbes' presidential campaign in 2000, not Buchanan.
<p> Gail Fenumiai, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said Todd Palin twice registered under the Alaskan Independence Party A,__ in 1995 and 2000. Some members of the party have advocated secession from the United States, though that is not a goal listed in the party's platform.
<p> Voter registration records show Sarah Palin registered in May 1982 as a member of the Republican Party and has not changed her affiliation. Todd Palin has been registered undeclared since 2002, Fenumiai said.
<p> Palin did address the Alaskan Independence Party's state convention by video earlier this year, welcoming the party to Fairbanks.
<p> "Your party plays an important role in our state's politics," she said in the video, which is posted on the party's Web site. "I've always said that competition is so good, and that applies to political parties as well."
<p> Having ideals is bad, because then you are expected to live up to them, and if you fail, then you have that nagging incocnsistency to deal with -- kind of a gulit. So it is best not to have any ideals, you know, if you keep your expectations low enough you are sure to meet them. That.
<p> Me? I like people having ideals, and when they fail to meet them, own up to that failure, try to repair the damage, and keep on trying to meet the ideals, no matter how hard it is. I think that shows a lot of character, a good character. I suppose that kind of striving and tolerance is too old-fashioned for many, but I approve of it. Kind of an If reaction to life.
<p> State school and Community college professors can often take on the worst airs. They want so bad to be part of the club.... maybe claw their way into the third or fourth tier of the academy that they turn into chameleons. No wonder most are voting Obama... God forbid they get selected out
<p> She wasnA,,t a member, she only pandered to their A,"Alaska FirstA,A_ message. All the better.
<p> "Gail Fenumiai, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said Todd Palin twice registered under the Alaskan Independence Party A,__ in 1995 and 2000. Some members of the party have advocated secession from the United States, though that is not a goal listed in the party's platform."
<p> No, youA,,re reducing it to Bosch painting. An angry sea of demonic, inbred, gun-toting hicks washing up against the bastions of the ivory tower.
<p> I did nothing of the sort. Feel free to continue with the lies, though. They're quite charming.
<p> So you have, in fact, worked for a living and paid your own bills (outside of academia)?
<p> NOT RELEVANT. If you want this debate to turn into an identitarian pissing contest, well, this would be an odd place to have one, given that I don't buy into that bullshit. Nor, if I'm not mistaken -- and evidence on this thread to the contrary -- is our host.
<p> YouA,,re the same fellow who got pissed when Jeff pointed out the foul comments some of your brethren on the left made, claiming the timing of pointing the foulness out was as bad as the actual foulness.
<p> Rob, I say this with all my heart and soul: you, my friend, can go fuck yourself. Note that I'm not calling you a name, merely wishing an action upon you. But why do I want you to fuck yourself? Because you willfully miss the point. As when Thomas writes:
<p> Until it is know with some certainty that this pregnancy was unplanned, and therefore A,EoabortionA,, was a viable question, then using this incident as ammunition in the abortion war is inappropriate and distasteful.
<p> And I respond:
<p> Thomas, you make a fine point here, but then the debate would shift to whether you believe someone just this side of statutory rape laws is fit to be a parent. (Note: IA,,m not testing those waters, merely pointing at the lake.)
<p> I'm not saying wink-wink nudge-nudge, Person I Heartily Wish Would Go Fuck Himself, but "When Topic X arises, Topic Y usually follows." Which it did. You want to insist I -- what, Person I Think Should Go Fuck Himself? That in recognizing the fineness of Thomas's point and acknowledging the way the direction usually (and did!) turn thereafter, I'm insinuating something about Palin or her daughter and not, as Person Whose Self-Fucking I Endorse fails to recognize, commenting on the conversation itself not the people it's about . You know what, Leader of the Free People Scott Wants to See Self-Fucking? Conversations about militarism often lead to conversations about Iraq. Heavens! And conversations about the drinking age often lead to conversations about drunk driving. As if! And in this same vein, Mr. Should Already Be Fucking Himself, conversations about teen pregnancies often lead to conversations about statutory rape and the fitness of minors to be parents.
<p> So here's the deal: you start fucking yourself, then get back to me when -- no, don't get back to me, just keep on fucking yourself.
<p> OK, so Palin giving a video-taped speech to an "unacceptable" political party is horrible, but Obama spending 20 years in the pews listening to Rev. Wright's unique brand of Christianity, Marxism, racism and conspiracy theories is okey-dokey.
<p> I keep hearing these sneers about Norman Rockwell. What, exactly, is so evil that he did? That such an ideal shouldn't be worked to, or do the detrators find themselves falling so short that they would rather attack him (the messenger) then acknowledge the worth of the message?
<p> He did those "Four Freedoms" posters, and I think they are inspired, making visible a worthy message.
<p> I read the link, Jeff, but to be frank, I'm not inclined to trust what a McCain staffer tells someone who writes for The Corner. I know both parties are liable to be unbiased and all -- wait a minute, no I don't. I think the opposite, in fact. So you'll excuse me if I wait for independent confirmation.
<p> But we're in agreement -- you think I should go fuck myself (apparently because I pointed out your willingness to defend the ugliness of your political brethren), and I think you should go fuck yourself (because of your willingness to defend the ugliness of your political brethren).
<p> Would you praise someone for not murdering the person who rear-ended them?
<p> I probably would praise someone for not murdering the person who rear-ended them if they were legally allowed to do such a thing. Usually though, we have laws to protect people from being murdered, so you don't have to applaud people for not doing it.
<p> A,"Gail Fenumiai, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said Todd Palin twice registered under the Alaskan Independence Party A,__ in 1995 and 2000. Some members of the party have advocated secession from the United States, though that is not a goal listed in the partyA,,s platform. A,A_
<p> That was from your AP link, Scott. There are some members of the Democrat Party that thinks 911 happened because God Hates Fags, do you want to tote that around?
<p> Obama not picking Hillary was just stupid, a serious rookie move. The only way to make it worse would be to pick an ass like Biden instead. His racist jew-hating communism is bad too, but that's really more of a personal issue than a political one.
<p> His one saving hope is that McCain would rather strap a car battery to your testicles than allow you to speak your mind during an election season.
<p> SEK: "The way I see it, only former Presidents are qualified to be Presidents; or maybe I mean Governors, only Governors and former Presidents; or maybe Mayors, only Mayors, Governors, and Presidents (former or otherwise) are qualified to be President. That being the case, VOTE MCCAIN!"
<p> Instead, you'd trot out some Chicago Machine political hack, a callow opportunist in bed with racists (Wright), terrorists (Ayers), and crooks (Rezko). He threw "changiness" and "hopitude" under the bus when he opted for the ulitmate insider for VP -- a bloviating, plagiarising retread of a gaffe machine whose list of draft deferment that rivals Cheney's.
<p> Worry about the plank in thine own eye before troubling yourself about the mote in anyone else's.
<p> I read the link, Jeff, but to be frank, IA,,m not inclined to trust what a McCain staffer tells someone who writes for The Corner. I know both parties are liable to be unbiased and all A,__ wait a minute, no I donA,,t. I think the opposite, in fact. So youA,,ll excuse me if I wait for independent confirmation.
<p> That's convenient: you are not willing to believe those who did the vetting, which in turn allows you to say that she wasn't vetted.
<p> How perfectly self-contained!
<p> By the way, that's a "senior campaign official." And an independent confirmation of the vetting would be...what, exactly?
<p> Face it. She wasn't on Obamaco's radar. McCain caught them off-guard. His campaign kept the leaks contained. So now the worst of the worst of the "progressive" left are scurrying to dig up dirt on this woman and her family.
<p> All because they just don't get enough joy out of sitting back and "literally laughing" at the pick, presumably.
<p> Okay. My job is done. Marc Ambinder is convinced, but SEK needs proof other than the fact that Occam's Razor suggests each of the two major parties more than likely got around to vetting their VP pick.
<p> Just because IA,,m the only liberal here doesnA,,t mean IA,,m responsible for every single thing my A,"ideological brethrenA,A_ do. Really, it doesnA,,t. I mean, you could A,__ and, in the past, have A,__ spend all day listing the topics I havenA,,t addressed, then call me dishonest for not addressing them, but you know how much fun that is? (Hint: Not at all.) I donA,,t feel obliged to respond to each and every complaint you have about Democrats, liberals, leftists, communists, Marxists, and every other group youA,,re too ignorant to know the difference between.
<p> You mean the opposite of what your cadre at Acephelous or Edge of the West do? Wait, no, it's exactly the same thing. Grouper behavior is the same whether we are talking regulars on a blog or a newsgroup or a coffeshop or a bar. You walk in and fart in the faces of the regulars, if you can't predict the outcome, well, that's a reflection on your capacity.
<p> As for your "chosing between Option 1 and Option 1? nonsense, numerous attempts to get you to clarify that have resulted only in you telling everyone how stupid they are for not getting it. Looks to me like the problem is either your capacity to communicate your thoughts has been overtopped like a 9th Ward levy, or your capacity to admiting to advancing a bullshit argument is reminicent of a barometer under a force 9 gale.
<p> well, in my experience. no. growing up,a couple of times I heard, A,"I donA,,t care that your hosting a PGA tournament if you donA,,t take care of the yard, IA,,m calling CHEMLAWN.A,A_
<p> Shultz is obviously unfamiliar with the piece of carp home PCs in the homes of IT professionals all over the globe. Just can't bring ourselves to do what feels like work while at home.

I know both parties are liable to be unbiased and all A,__ wait a minute, no I donA,,t. I think the opposite, in fact. So youA,,ll excuse me if I wait for independent confirmation.
<p> If this is to become a new standard, will the Parties have to secure Price Waterhouse or someone to do their vetting who can then testify to being a disinterested third party (as if) since you can't bring yourself to trust a staffer. No one else but a staffer is likelyt ot be able to speak knowledgably about the subject.
<p> From Jeff's link on Levi: "...The young parents-to-be haven't faced any pressure to wed, says the boy's mother, Sherry Johnston, reporting that the two teens planned to marry before it was known she was pregnant .
<p> Hey, I'm depressed and broke, and Scott's done me a great service: made me laugh out loud for the first time in days.
<p> I donA,,t feel obliged to respond to each and every complaint you have about Democrats, liberals, leftists, communists, Marxists, and every other group youA,,re too ignorant to know the difference between.
<p> This from a guy who not only can't discern any practical difference between Pat Buchanan and George Bush (either), he spends his time condescending to people who claim there is one. Hilarious.
<p> Another thing -- the lefties are also trying to make hay over the First Dude's 22-year-old DUI. Except he's not running for office. And their actual presidential candidate admits to using illegal drugs around the same time.
<p> Another thing A,__ the lefties are also trying to make hay over the First DudeA,,s 22-year-old DUI. Except heA,,s not running for office. And their actual presidential candidate admits to using illegal drugs around the same time.

<p> Er, Kueefman, amusingly it's the left making the initial noise about qualifications, more than a little amusingly because -- do I really have to spell it out? So what did you expect the normal people to do, nod approvingly?
<p> I'm not getting involved, 'cause, frankly, you're too fucking boring at this stage to make it worth my while.
<p> Now, go back to picking on a 17 year old kids and Downs babies. They're a more appropriate challenge for you. I'd keep a sharp eye out for hockey players if I were you, though. Something tells me that young Levi knows all about hooking, tripping, spearing, and butt-ending.

<p> The National Enquirer broke the story, from what I read. Not a freaking word do I believe from McCain, Palin, the bobbleheads at the RNC talking point memo committee, from you or anyone here. Over at the McCain Bloggette on Meet Moose Mom Palin day, you don't see mention of what? Anywhere on that day and after do you see mention of the story? Why? We-so-proud-o'er-babies! Yet they didn't tell the media that mommy and daughter were brewing chill'un at the same time?
<p> Makes no sense.
<p> The Enquirer claims they spooked the story and some quotes out of Levi's parents and at the point htey were headed to print the story Levi's family contacted Palin who then contacted McCain.
<p> Sorry, but this elitist-egalitarian-whatever smells a pedigreed skunk in the woodchipper. Something ain't making sense! Someone ain't telling the truth!
<p> Shackle me and hang me long! I beat you to victimhood by two threads. I am. Believe it.
<p> I did not know of Paul Harvey, SBP. He has a take on the (I think) beaux arts style, that was used in early twentieth century illustration (I'm thinking Howard Pyle or N.C. Wyeth). I saw the Undine statue at the Ringling Museum in Sarasota when I was visiting the folks about a decade ago. There was a travelling exhibition on the art of the Gilded Age sponsored by the Smithsonian.
<p> The statue struck me because it was so perfect. I expected Undine to continue walking forward, and it was done in marble, and the light shone through the stone drapery. The level of mastery of a medium was so apparent, that most of the modern stuff I had recently seen at the DIA was the mere mewlings of children.
<p> Norman Rockwell never made the pretensions that his detractors have fastened on, he did workman-like illustration, and at times he hit the sublime -- the "Four Freedoms" I mentioned.
<p> Anyhow -- I was severely off-topic. But that statue of Undine still rocks me. The artist spoke through stone, and I didn't need a translator to hear him. The work spoke to me, and still does.
<p> I bet there's lots of whispering in your closet. Lot's of literary Marxists all kinds of word play. Men of the secret! Existing in silence. Double Dutching in Vienna and Warsaw and secreting off in Berlin. Thar he blows Jacques Cousteau!
<p> So you have, in fact, worked for a living and paid your own bills (outside of academia)?
<p> NOT RELEVANT. If you want this debate to turn into an identitarian pissing contest, well, this would be an odd place to have one, given that I donA,,t buy into that bullshit. Nor, if IA,,m not mistaken A,__ and evidence on this thread to the contrary A,__ is our host.
<p> Hahahaha!
<p> Squat Erk Queefman defends not working for a living by immersing himself in academia where he can even avoid thinking for a living.
<p> In fact, the only think Squat Erk Queefman has ever done for a living is squat and *erk* queef when and where some leftist professor has told him to squat and queef.
<p> After that kind of abject humiliation and domination, he hates suburban, picket-fence, hockey-mom, breeder America like Gollum hateses the Shire.
<p> Out over the ramparts are the measured screams of men. The horses, like the fighting men, look so small but not out of place at all. If you don't know what to believe, even if you need to forget, remember all you love, take a drink for your bottle and trust death.
<p> Where's the Alaskan Joan of Arc midst the sea of white faces and geriatrics at the Xcel center?
<p> Where all da proud black people at? Didn't they protest enough? The illegal Mezzicans that IPB snuck over the border, not a mariachi to be found. There's no talk of human tragedy becoming an incessant necessity! Just flag-wavers singing of sea to shining sea.
<p> Let's see what forms lie within that sea of ivory. They're so there, lying there, laying it down.
<p> You might not like Governor Palin now, thor, but I think she's a great pick. I bet if you knew more about her you'd think she was just really good people. I hope she gets the opportunity to bring the capabilities she's shown in Alaska to Washington. I think if she gets that opportunity a lot of the personal attacks on her and her family will be seen as ineffective and future female candidates will be evaluated more on merit. That's progress I think.
<p> Personally, I donA,,t think Obama ever planned on getting this far A,__ he was probably shooting for building brand recognition with an eye toward a serious run in 2012. When his pre-planned script ran out he simply got stuck.
<p> I think Obama was supposed to be Hillarys VP. It would have been the most perfect ticket in identity politc's history. And probably unstoppable.
<p> Thanks to a media that doesn't know how to do their jobs any longer, Obamas messiah complex, and stupid rich celebrities, this is going to be a blood bath.
<p> Your A,"church ladyA,A_ stereotype is about 40 years out of date, and wasnA,,t very accurate even then.
<p> Au contraire. She may have started up as a caricature of them godbotherers, but it wasn't long before they used her as a way to skewer Madonna's sluttiness, for example, in ways they couldn't in their normal voices. Church Lady got to say things that were unsayable in their little world. So they ran with it.
<p> And SEK, if you're still around:
<p> The reason Palin alienated the whole Alaskan GOP is because they were all CORRUPT (no really: corrupt Republicans) and she exposed their shenanigans and shut them down . Two AK congressmen are in jail because they were taking bribes from the oil companies, whom she also smacked around to the satisfaction of many.
<p> So that would also explain why the McCain campaign didn't consult the AK GOP party: you don't consult a man's ex-wife as a character witness, and you don't ask crooks about the cops.
<p> if I donA,,t respond to each and every one of them, Darleen whines
<p> You have my permission to ignore Darleen, Scott. And you needn't respond to this brief note, as it's pretty much devoid, like much of my other commentary, of any debating substance. I just wanted to say that I (for one) don't wish you gone, even though I disagree with much that you've said here today. The piling-on thing you should just look at as a single-input, multiple-output system. I've run into the exact same thing at Obsidian Wings, only with the ideological orientations reversed. You can deal with it, or decline to engage in it, but for the love of God don't complain about it. No one is going to appoint themselves your sole opponent.
<p> Oh, and the vetting thing? As Jeff says, if you don't believe the people who did the vetting, who else do you have left? What did you expect, phone calls from people announcing that they're from the McCain campaign, asking for details of this person that they're considering as a VP nomination? That's a sure way to keep the lid on things.
<p> To move your false narrative forward requires using nonexistent connections and madcap logic. I think they call that aleatory form.
<p> "False narrative"? Madcap + logic = aleatory form? Actually, Einstein, I was making a comparison of form and asking if it fit, as if spelling all that out for a lunkhead like you wouldn't reduce me to all the brilliance of mud by mere contact with the subject.
<p> I'd love to see you try and run a unicycle, genius. At any rate, some spectacular irony there, thor, in addition to falling all over your otherwise sterling and masterful vocabulary. Well done, sir!
<p> I mean, when you yourself are reduced to 100% trolling, why not smear it around? Hell, you can play serious whenever you want and even change definitions at will!
