<p> Zinn was born to a Jewish immigrant family in Brooklyn . His father, Eddie Zinn, born in Austria-Hungary , emigrated to the U.S. with his brother Samuel before the outbreak of World War I. Howard's mother, Jenny (Rabinowitz) Zinn, [ 4 ] emigrated from the Eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk .
<p> Both parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn's parents introduced him to literature by sending 10 cents plus a coupon to the New York Post for each of the 20 volumes of Charles Dickens ' collected works. [ 5 ] He also studied creative writing at Thomas Jefferson High School in a special program established by principal and poet Elias Lieberman. [ 6 ]
<p> On a post-doctoral research mission nine years later, Zinn visited the resort near Bordeaux where he interviewed residents, reviewed municipal documents, and read wartime newspaper clippings at the local library. In 1966, Zinn returned to Royan after which he gave his fullest account of that research in his book, The Politics of History . On the ground, Zinn learned that the aerial bombing attacks in which he participated had killed more than 1000 French civilians as well as some German soldiers hiding near Royan to await the war's end, events that are described "in all accounts" he found as "une tragique erreur" that leveled a small but ancient city and "its population that was, at least officially, friend, not foe." In The Politics of History , Zinn described how the bombing was ordered-three weeks before the war in Europe ended-by military officials who were, in part, motivated more by the desire for their own career advancement than in legitimate military objectives. He quotes the official history of the U.S. Army Air Forces' brief reference to the Eighth Air Force attack on Royan and also, in the same chapter, to the bombing of Pilsen in what was then Czechoslovakia . The official history stated that the famous Skoda works in Pilsen "received 500 well-placed tons," and that "because of a warning sent out ahead of time the workers were able to escape, except for five persons."
<p> Zinn wrote:
<p> I recalled flying on that mission, too, as deputy lead bombardier, and that we did not aim specifically at the 'Skoda works' (which I would have noted, because it was the one target in Czechoslovakia I had read about) but dropped our bombs, without much precision, on the city of Pilsen. Two Czech citizens who lived in Pilsen at the time told me, recently, that several hundred people were killed in that raid (that is, Czechs)-not five. [ 10 ]
<p> Zinn said his experience as a wartime bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for, and effects of the bombing of Royan and Pilsen, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by G.I.s during wartime. [ 11 ] Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations that inflicted massive civilian casualties during the Allied bombing of cities such as Dresden , Royan, Tokyo , and Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, Hanoi during the War in Vietnam , and Baghdad during the war in Iraq and the civilian casualties during bombings in Afghanistan during the current and nearly decade-old war there. In his pamphlet, Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence [ 12 ] written in 1995, he laid out the case against targeting civilians with aerial bombing.
<p> Six years later, he wrote:
<p> Recall that in the midst of the Gulf War , the U.S. military bombed an air raid shelter , killing 400 to 500 men, women, and children who were huddled to escape bombs. The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that. I suggest that the history of bombing-and no one has bombed more than this nation-is a history of endless atrocities, all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like 'accident', 'military target', and 'collateral damage'. [ 13 ]
<p> "We were not born critical of existing society. There was a moment in our lives (or a month, or a year) when certain facts appeared before us, startled us, and then caused us to question beliefs that were strongly fixed in our consciousness - embedded there by years of family prejudices, orthodox schooling, imbibing of newspapers, radio, and television. This would seem to lead to a simple conclusion: that we all have an enormous responsibility to bring to the attention of others information they do not have, which has the potential of causing them to rethink long-held ideas."
<p> In 1964, Zinn accepted a position at Boston University , after writing two books and participating in the Civil Rights Movement in the South. His classes in civil liberties were among the most popular at the university with as many as 400 students subscribing each semester to the non-required class. A professor of political science , he taught at BU for 24 years and retired in 1988 at age 64.
<p> "He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. But he always kept his sense of humor. He was a happy warrior," said Caryl Rivers, journalism professor at Boston University. Rivers and Zinn were among a group of faculty members who in 1979 defended the right of the school's clerical workers to strike and were threatened with dismissal after refusing to cross a picket line. [ 18 ]
<p> Zinn came to believe that the point of view expressed in traditional history books was often limited. Biographer Martin Duberman noted that when he was asked directly if he was a Marxist, Zinn replied, "Yes, I'm something of a Marxist." He especially was influenced by the liberating vision of the young Marx in overcoming alienation, and disliked Marx's later dogmatism. In later life he moved more toward anarchism. [ 19 ]
<p> In the years since the first edition of A People's History was published in 1980, it has been used as an alternative to standard textbooks in many high school and college history courses, and it is one of the most widely known examples of critical pedagogy . The New York Times Book Review stated in 2006 that the book "routinely sells more than 100,000 copies a year". [ 21 ]
<p> In 2008, the Zinn Education Project [ 22 ] was launched to support educators using A People's History of the United States as a source for middle and high school history. The Project was started when a former student of Zinn, who wanted to bring Zinn's lessons to students around the country, provided the financial backing to allow two other organizations, Rethinking Schools and Teaching for Change to coordinate the Project. The Project hosts a website that has over 100 free downloadable lesson plans to complement A People's History of the United States .
<p> Although Zinn was a tenured professor, he was dismissed in June 1963 after siding with students in the struggle against segregation. As Zinn described [ 32 ] in The Nation , though Spelman administrators prided themselves for turning out refined "young ladies," its students were likely to be found on the picket line, or in jail for participating in the greater effort to break down segregation in public places in Atlanta. Zinn's years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times. His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, "are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me. I learned more from my students than my students learned from me." [ 33 ]
<p> Zinn wrote about the struggle for civil rights, as both participant and historian. [ 36 ] His second book, The Southern Mystique [ 37 ] was published in 1964, the same year as his SNCC: The New Abolitionists in which he describes how the sit-ins against segregation were initiated by students and, in that sense, were independent of the efforts of the older, more established civil rights organizations.
<p> In 2005, forty-one years after his firing, Zinn returned to Spelman where he was given an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters and delivered the commencement address [ 38 ] [ 39 ] where he said in part, during his speech titled, "Against Discouragement," that "the lesson of that history is that you must not despair, that if you are right, and you persist, things will change. The government may try to deceive the people, and the newspapers and television may do the same, but the truth has a way of coming out. The truth has a power greater than a hundred lies." [ 40 ]
<p> Zinn wrote one of the earliest books calling for the U.S. withdrawal from its war in Vietnam . Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal was published by Beacon Press in 1967 based on his articles in Commonweal , The Nation , and Ramparts .
<p> In Noam Chomsky 's view, The Logic of Withdrawal was Zinn's most important book. "He was the first person to say-loudly, publicly, very persuasively-that this simply has to stop; we should get out, period, no conditions; we have no right to be there; it's an act of aggression; pull out. It was so surprising at the time that there wasn't even a review of the book. In fact, he asked me if I would review it in Ramparts just so that people would know about the book." [ 41 ]
<p> In December 1969, radical historians tried unsuccessfully to persuade the American Historical Association to pass an anti-Vietnam War resolution. "A debacle unfolded as Harvard historian (and AHA president in 1968) John Fairbank literally wrestled the microphone from Zinn's hands." [ 42 ] Correspondence by Fairbank, Zinn and other historians, published by the AHA in 1970, is online in what Fairbank called "our briefly-famous Struggle for the Mike". [ 43 ]
<p> In later years, Zinn was an adviser to the Disarm Education Fund. [ 44 ]
<p> Zinn's diplomatic visit to Hanoi with Rev. Daniel Berrigan , during the Tet Offensive in January 1968, resulted in the return of three American airmen, the first American POWs released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun. The event was widely reported in the news media and discussed in a variety of books including Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963-1975 by Nancy Zaroulis and Gerald Sullivan. [ 45 ] Zinn and the Berrigan brothers, Dan and Philip , remained friends and allies over the years.
<p> Also in January 1968, he signed the "Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war. [ 46 ]
<p> Daniel Ellsberg , a former RAND consultant who had secretly copied The Pentagon Papers , which described the history of the United States' military involvement in Southeast Asia, gave a copy to Howard and Roslyn Zinn. [ 47 ] Along with Noam Chomsky , Zinn edited and annotated the copy of The Pentagon Papers that Senator Mike Gravel read into the Congressional Record and that was subsequently published by Beacon Press in what has come to be known as the Senator Mike Gravel edition of The Pentagon Papers - four volumes plus a fifth volume containing analysis by Chomsky and Zinn.
<p> Announced on August 17 [ 48 ] and published on October 22, 1971, [ citation needed ] this four-volume, relatively expensive set [ 48 ] became the "Senator Gravel Edition", which studies from Cornell University and the Annenberg Center for Communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the Pentagon Papers to be published. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The "Gravel Edition" was edited and annotated by Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war, also edited by Chomsky and Zinn. [ 50 ] Beacon Press became the object of an FBI investigation; [ 51 ] an outgrowth of which was Gravel v. United States in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 1972; [ 51 ] that the Speech or Debate Clause in the US Constitution did grant immunity to Gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee, and did grant some immunity to Gravel's congressional aide, but granted no immunity to Beacon Press in relation to its publishing the same papers. [ 52 ]
<p> Zinn testified as an expert witness at Ellsberg's criminal trial for theft, conspiracy, and espionage in connection with the publication of the Pentagon Papers by The New York Times . Defense attorneys asked Zinn to explain to the jury the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from World War II through 1963. Zinn discussed that history for several hours, and later reflected on his time before the jury.
<p> I explained there was nothing in the papers of military significance that could be used to harm the defense of the United States, that the information in them was simply embarrassing to our government because what was revealed, in the government's own interoffice memos, was how it had lied to the American public. The secrets disclosed in the Pentagon Papers might embarrass politicians, might hurt the profits of corporations wanting tin, rubber, oil, in far-off places. But this was not the same as hurting the nation, the people. [ 53 ]
<p> Zinn's testimony on the motivation for government secrecy was confirmed in 1989 by Erwin Griswold , who as U.S. solicitor general during the Nixon administration, sued The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971 to stop publication. [ 54 ] Griswold persuaded three Supreme Court justices to vote to stop The New York Times from continuing to publish the Pentagon Papers, an order known as " prior restraint " that has been held to be illegal under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . The papers were simultaneously published in The Washington Post , effectively nullifying the effect of the prior restraint order. In 1989, Griswold admitted there had been no national security damage resulting from publication. [ 54 ] In a column in the Washington Post , Griswold wrote: "It quickly becomes apparent to any person who has considerable experience with classified material that there is massive over classification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national security, but with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another."
<p> Zinn supported the G.I. antiwar movement during the U.S. war in Vietnam. In the 2001 film Unfinished Symphony , Zinn provides a historical context for the 1971 antiwar march by Vietnam Veterans against the War . The marchers traveled from Lexington , Massachusetts , to Bunker Hill , "which retraced Paul Revere 's ride of 1775 and ended in the massive arrest of 410 veterans and civilians by the Lexington police." The film depicts "scenes from the 1971 Winter Soldier hearings, [ 55 ] during which former G.I.s testified about "atrocities" they either participated in or said they had witnessed committed by U.S. forces in Vietnam. [ 56 ]
<p> Zinn opposed the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq and wrote several books about it. In an interview with The Brooklyn Rail he said,
<p> We certainly should not be initiating a war, as it's not a clear and present danger to the United States, or in fact, to anyone around it. If it were, then the states around Iraq would be calling for a war on it. The Arab states around Iraq are opposed to the war, and if anyone's in danger from Iraq, they are. At the same time, the U.S. is violating the U.N. charter by initiating a war on Iraq. Bush made a big deal about the number of resolutions Iraq has violated-and it's true, Iraq has not abided by the resolutions of the Security Council. But it's not the first nation to violate Security Council resolutions. Israel has violated Security Council resolutions every year since 1967. Now, however, the U.S. is violating a fundamental principle of the U.N. Charter, which is that nations can't initiate a war-they can only do so after being attacked. And Iraq has not attacked us. [ 57 ]
<p> He asserted that the U.S. would end Gulf War II when resistance within the military increased in the same way resistance within the military contributed to ending the U.S. war in Vietnam. Zinn compared the demand by a growing number of contemporary U.S. military families to end the war in Iraq to parallel demands "in the Confederacy in the Civil War, when the wives of soldiers rioted because their husbands were dying and the plantation owners were profiting from the sale of cotton, refusing to grow grains for civilians to eat." [ 58 ]
<p> Jean-Christophe Agnew, Professor of History and American Studies at Yale University , told the Yale Daily News in May 2007 that Zinns historical work is "highly influential and widely used". [ 59 ] He observed that it is not unusual for prominent professors such as Zinn to weigh in on current events, citing a resolution opposing the war in Iraq that was recently ratified by the American Historical Association . [ 60 ] Agnew added: "In these moments of crisis, when the country is split-so historians are split". [ 61 ]
<p> Zinn described himself as "something of an anarchist , something of a socialist . Maybe a democratic socialist ." [ 62 ] [ 63 ] He suggested looking at socialism in its full historical context as a popular, positive idea that got a bad name from its association with Soviet Communism. In Madison, Wisconsin , in 2009, Zinn said:
<p> Let's talk about socialism. I think it's very important to bring back the idea of socialism into the national discussion to where it was at the turn of the [last] century before the Soviet Union gave it a bad name. Socialism had a good name in this country. Socialism had Eugene Debs . It had Clarence Darrow . It had Mother Jones . It had Emma Goldman . It had several million people reading socialist newspapers around the country. Socialism basically said, hey, let's have a kinder, gentler society. Let's share things. Let's have an economic system that produces things not because they're profitable for some corporation, but produces things that people need. People should not be retreating from the word socialism because you have to go beyond capitalism. [ 64 ]
<p> Because of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, on July 30, 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a file with 423 pages of information on Howard Zinns life and activities. During the height of McCarthyism in 1949, the FBI first opened a domestic security investigation on Zinn (FBI File # 100-360217), based on Zinns activities in what the agency considered to be communist front groups and informant reports that Zinn was an active member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). [ 65 ] Zinn denied ever being a member and said that he had participated in the activities of various organizations which might be considered Communist fronts but that his participation was motivated by his belief that in this country people had the right to believe, think, and act according to their own ideals. [ 65 ] According to journalist Chris Hedges , Zinn "steadfastly refused to cooperate in the anti-communist witch hunts in the 1950s." [ 66 ]
<p> Later in the 1960s, as a result of Zinn's campaigning against the Vietnam War and his influence on Martin Luther King, Jr. , the FBI designated Zinn a high security risk to the country, a category that allowed them to summarily arrest him if a state of emergency were to be declared. [ 65 ] [ 67 ] The FBI memos also show that they were concerned with Zinns repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect blacks against white mob violence. Zinn's daughter said she was not surprised by the files; "He always knew they had a file on him". [ 65 ]
<p> In one of his last interviews, [ 71 ] Zinn stated that he would like to be remembered "for introducing a different way of thinking about the world, about war, about human rights, about equality," and
<p> for getting more people to realize that the power which rests so far in the hands of people with wealth and guns, that the power ultimately rests in people themselves and that they can use it. At certain points in history, they have used it. Black people in the South used it. People in the women's movement used it. People in the anti-war movement used it. People in other countries who have overthrown tyrannies have used it.
<p> He said he wanted to be known as "somebody who gave people a feeling of hope and power that they didn't have before." [ 72 ]
<p> Established by school teachers while he was alive, the Zinn Education Project is Howard Zinn's legacy to middle- and high-school teachers and their students. The nonprofit organization offers classroom teachers free and low-cost teaching activities based on A People's History and like-minded history texts.
<p> "I can't think of anyone who had such a powerful and benign influence. His historical work changed the way millions of people saw the past. The happy thing about Howard was that in the last years he could gain satisfaction that his contributions were so impressive and recognized."
<p> For his leadership in the Peace Movement, Zinn received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award in 1996. He received the Thomas Merton Award and, in 1998, the Eugene V. Debs Award. [ 73 ] In 1998, he won the Lannan Literary Award [ 74 ] for nonfiction and the following year won the Upton Sinclair Award, which honors social activism. In 2003, Zinn was awarded the Prix des Amis du Monde diplomatique [ 75 ] for the French version of his seminal work, Une histoire populaire des Etats-Unis.
<p> On October 5, 2006, Zinn received the Haven's Center Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship in Madison, Wisconsin . [ 76 ]
<p> The Associated Press (AP) revealed in July 2013 that former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels asked for assurance from his education advisors that Zinn's works were not taught in K-12 public schools in the state. [ 77 ] The AP had gained access to Daniels' emails under a Freedom of Information Act request. Daniels also wanted a "cleanup" of K-12 professional development courses to eliminate "propaganda and highlight (if there is any) the more useful offerings." [ 78 ]
<p> In one of the emails, Daniels expressed contempt for Zinn upon his death:
<p> This terrible anti-American academic has finally passed away...The obits and commentaries mentioned his book, A Peoples History of the United States, is the textbook of choice in high schools and colleges around the country. It is a truly execrable, anti-factual piece of disinformation that misstates American history on every page. Can someone assure me that it is not in use anywhere in Indiana? If it is, how do we get rid of it before more young people are force-fed a totally false version of our history? [ 79 ]
<p> At the time the emails were released, Daniels was serving as the president of Purdue University . In response, 90 out of roughly 1,800 Purdue professors issued an open letter expressing their concern. Included in the letter were some of the staff's most prominent historians. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Because of Daniels' attempt to suppress Zinn's book, the former governor was accused of censorship, to which Daniels responded by saying that his views were misrepresented, and that if Zinn were alive and a member of the Purdue faculty, he would defend his free speech rights and right to publish. [ 84 ]
<p> David J. Bobb supported Daniels' stand on Zinn by penning an opinion piece in the online Wall Street Journal, where he asserted Zinn was not a real historian, but a Marxist-propagandist. [ 85 ] However, Zinn has consistently expressed his personal political ideology to be aligned with anarchist thought, and has conceded that he is "something" of a Marxist being that "people have so many different notions about what a Marxist is." [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Ironically , the controversy led to an upswing in interest in Zinn's A People's History of the United States and other writings. [ 88 ]
<p> In 2002 punkrock record label Alternative Tentacles , released Apocalypse Always! , a compilation CD featuring many punk rock bands as well as a spoken word track by Howard Zinn.
<p> The Pearl Jam song "Down" from the album Lost Dogs was inspired by the band's friendship with Zinn. [ citation needed ] In the March 13, 2010, episode of Saturday Night Live , lead singer Eddie Vedder 's guitar sports a sticker reading "ZINN". The band dedicated a performance of their song "Undone" as a tribute to Zinn during their 5/17/10 concert at TD Garden in Boston, MA. A tribute to Howard Zinn's wife, Roslyn, was prominently featured in the tour program for Eddie Vedder's solo tour of 2008.
<p> In the System Of A Down song "Deer Dance", about police brutality against peaceful protest, Zinn is paraphrased in the line "We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train" and in their song "AD.D" from their album Steal This Album! : "There is no flag large enough, to hide the shame of a man in cuffs."
<p> The song Franco Un-American , off the 2003 album The War on Errorism by American punk rock band NOFX , references lead singer Fat Mike reading Howard Zinn as part of learning more about the world: "I never looked around, never second-guessed, then I read some Howard Zinn, now I'm always depressed".
