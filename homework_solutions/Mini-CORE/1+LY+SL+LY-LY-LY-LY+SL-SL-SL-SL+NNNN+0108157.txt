<h> Girl, You Sure Know How To Say Goodbye lyrics
<h> George Jones Girl, You Sure Know How To Say Goodbye lyrics
<p> You kissed me and you said I was a gentleman to you You said I was a person you could trust You told me that you loved me, aw, in a way couldn't I Girl, you sure know how to say goodbye.
<p> You kissed me in a way you never did when love was right Girl, you sure know how to say goodbye I stood and watched you walk away, you know honey, I didn't even cry Girl, you sure know how to say goodbye. [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/georg\\... ] --- Instrumental ---
<p> You gave me that old pep talk as you cried on my sleeve You said that you'd come runnin' day or night You said that I could call on you throughout my lonely life Girl, you sure know how to say goodbye.
<p> You kissed me in a way you never did when love was right You hypnotised the hurt right out of me I stood and watched you walk away, ah honey, and I couldn't even cry Girl, you sure know how to say goodbye...
