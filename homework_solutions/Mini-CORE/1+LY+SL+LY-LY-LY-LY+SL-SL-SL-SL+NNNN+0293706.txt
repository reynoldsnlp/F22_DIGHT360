<h> When He Was on the Cross Lyrics
<h> When He Was on the Cross Lyrics
<p> I'm not on an ego trip, I'm nothing on my own I make mistakes and sometimes slip Just common flesh and bone But I'll prove some day just why I say I'm of a special kind For when He was on the cross I was on His mind
<p> A look of love was on His face The thorns were in His head The blood was on that scarlet robe And stained it crimson red Though His eyes were on the crowd that day He looked ahead in time For when He was on the cross I was on His mind
<p> He knew me, yet He loved me He whose glory makes the Heaven's shine So unworthy, of such mercy For when He was on the cross I was on His mind For when He was on the cross I was on His mind
