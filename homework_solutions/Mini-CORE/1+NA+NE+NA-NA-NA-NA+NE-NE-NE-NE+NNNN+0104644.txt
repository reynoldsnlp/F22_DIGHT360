<p> The mother of an actor who died at a party attended by Pete Doherty has filed a complaint over how the case was handled.
<p> Sheila Blanco has been campaigning for answers since her son Mark died as a result of a head injury sustained from falling from a first floor landing. The Libertines man was also at the same party in east London in December, 2006. Doherty was cleared of any wrongdoing last year when authorities ruled there was insufficient evidence to bring charges over the incident.
<p> Officials at London's Metropolitan Police conducted a probe into their original inquiry but, despite ruling last month that there were several "issues" with the investigation, no disciplinary measures have been taken against any officer. Mrs Blanco has now appealed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), where officials are examining how her grievance has been handled.
<p> There was a complaint made to the Met Police. They sometimes come to us or they investigate themselves. I think in this case they investigated themselves and Mrs Blanco is not happy with the outcome so she has appealed to us.
<p> She added: "So that is the situation being dealt with. We have just received it last month. We are looking at the appeal. We look to see whether the investigation [into Mrs Blanco's complaint] does what it said it would do."
<p> A Met Police spokeswoman added: "We received a complaint in response to various aspects of the original investigation. An investigation by the director of professional standards was launched. The investigation is now complete. An appeal has been lodged by the complainant with the IPCC."
