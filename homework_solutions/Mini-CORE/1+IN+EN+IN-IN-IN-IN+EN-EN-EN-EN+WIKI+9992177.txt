<p> Around the same time, in a calf brain, Rabi Simantov and Solomon H. Snyder of the United States found [ 4 ] what Eric Simon (who independently discovered opioid receptors in vertebral brains) later termed "endorphin" by an abbreviation of "endogenous morphine", meaning " morphine produced naturally in the body". [ 1 ] Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that human and diverse animal tissues are in fact capable of producing morphine itself, which is not a peptide . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
<p> Beta-endorphin (?-endorphin) is released into blood from the pituitary gland and into the spinal cord and brain from hypothalamic neurons. The ?-endorphin that is released into the blood cannot enter the brain in large quantities because of the blood-brain barrier , so the physiological importance of the ?-endorphin that can be measured in the blood is far from clear. ?-endorphin is a cleavage product of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is also the precursor hormone for adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). The behavioural effects of ?-endorphin is exerted by its actions in the brain and spinal cord, and it is presumed that the hypothalamic neurons are the major source of ?-endorphin at those sites. In situations where the level of ACTH is increased (e.g., Cushing's disease ), the level of ?-endorphin also increases slightly.
<p> ?-endorphin has the highest affinity for the ? 1 opioid receptor , slightly lower affinity for the ? 2 and ? opioid receptors, and low affinity for the ? 1 opioid receptors. ?-Opioid receptors are the main receptor through which morphine acts. In the classical sense, ? opioid receptors are presynaptic, and inhibit neurotransmitter release. Through that mechanism, they inhibit the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA , and disinhibit the dopamine pathways, causing more dopamine to be released. By hijacking this process, exogenous opioids cause inappropriate dopamine release, and can lead to aberrant synaptic plasticity , which can cause dependency . Opioid receptors have many other and more important roles in the brain and periphery; however, modulating pain, cardiac, gastric and vascular function as well as possibly panic and satiation. Also, receptors are often found at postsynaptic locations as well as at presynaptic locations.
<p> Scientists sometimes debate whether specific activities release measurable levels of endorphins. Much of the current data comes from animals which may not be relevant to humans. The studies that do involve humans often measure endorphin plasma levels, which do not necessarily correlate with levels in the central nervous system . Other studies use a blanket opioid antagonist (usually naloxone ) to indirectly measure the release of endorphins by observing the changes that occur when any endorphin activity that might be present is blocked.
<p> Endorphins are known to play a role in depersonalization disorder . The opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone have both been proven to be successful in treating depersonalization. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] To quote a 2001 naloxone study, "In three of 14 patients, depersonalization symptoms disappeared entirely and seven patients showed a marked improvement. The therapeutic effect of naloxone provides evidence for the role of the endogenous opioid system in the pathogenesis of depersonalization."
<p> A placental tissue of fetal origin - i.e., the syncytiotrophoblast - excretes beta-endorphins into the maternal blood system from the 3rd month of pregnancy. A recent study [ 14 ] proposes an adaptive background for this phenomenon. The authors argue that fetuses make their mothers endorphin-dependent then manipulate them to increase nutrient allocation to the placenta. Their hypothesis predicts that: (1) anatomic position of endorphin production should mirror its presumed role in foetal-maternal conflict; (2) endorphin levels should co-vary positively with nutrient carrying capacity of maternal blood system; (3) postpartum psychological symptoms (such as postpartum blues, depression, and psychosis) in humans are side-effects of this mechanism that can be interpreted as endorphin-deprivation symptoms; (4) shortly after parturition, placentophagy could play an adaptive role in decreasing the negative side-effects of foetal manipulation; (5) later, breast-feeding-induced endorphin excretion of the maternal pituitary saves the mother from further deprivation symptoms. These predictions appear to be supported by empirical data. [ 14 ]
