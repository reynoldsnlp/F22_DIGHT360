<h> Cristina Fernandez with a bout of low blood pressure cancels public activities
<p> Argentine President Cristina Fernndez was forced to cancel Tuesday's agenda for 24 hours after doctors diagnosed her with low blood pressure. The president remained at the Olivos residence where, nevertheless she dispatched some daily business with a few ministers.
<p> ?Today, the President of the Nation, Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner, was diagnosed with low blood pressure and was recommended complete rest for 24 hours,? the presidential doctors informed in a communiqu.
<p> Cristina Fernandez spent the week-end at her home in the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz and had several political ceremonies scheduled for Tuesday at Government House, Casa Rosada.
<p> However in the morning the president did not move from the residence and in the afternoon she met with Federal Planning minister Juliol De Vido; Economy minister Hernan Lorenzino; Deputy Economy minister Axel Kicillof and Public Works Secretary, Jose Lopez.
<p> Cristina Fernandez suffers from low blood pressure or hypotension and her last bout was in August when she had to suspend her agenda for two days. In January, April and October of last year the president suffered similar conditions and was forced to cancel a trip to Mexico.
<p> In January 2009, CFK has to suspend a trip to Cuba and in February the same year, an official visit to Korea.
<p> Cristina Fernandez has publicly confessed her condition of "chronic hypo-tense".
<p> In January 2012, Cristina Fernandez underwent successful surgery for a 'false-positive thyroid cancer', which contrary to stats resulted in benign. The operation took place 4 January and the president did not return to office until twenty days later. She had to postpone a planned visit to Chile.

<p> You can't pump blood if you don't have a heart. This would also explain why none of it ever reached her brain. I imagine British Kirchnerist is wearing a black lace veil and weeping on his knees towards the pictures of CFK in his wardrobe.
<p> I don't think her ego or sense of self preservation will allow her to step down. She is mentally unstable and all of this pressure is taking a toll. Starting with next week's protests, the planned national strike, IMF red card and the 2nd default in 10 yrs I don't see how she can take it. Should be fun to watch.
<p> @5 ?For many people, low blood pressure can cause dizziness and fainting or indicate serious heart, endocrine or neurological disorders. Severely low blood pressure can deprive the brain and other vital organs of oxygen and nutrients, leading to a life-threatening condition called shock.? Just a thought. Might such an individual also be considered close to brain-death? @13 Have you got your air-ticket? Will you be throwing yourself on the funeral pyre?
<p> Troll kamikaze , love it ...dive on into a subject spout racist jibes, distract and disrupt the bad news blog. perhaps we just ignore this kind of tactic and move on debating the subject of the article.
<p> Santa Fe I have said that about several of them here.....hence the multi ID's mainly from ther truth telling troll.....lol. I have been monitoring airfares the Argentina for my trip. For the first time I can recall, prices are dropping.....seems to be indicative of something.
<p> I typally fly from Logan (Boston) to Ezeiza. I start looking 3 months beofre my date and the prices typically rise weekly. This is the first time I've seen the dropping.
<p> Troy November...next week is the worldwide protests.......should prove intersting. I agree that they are starting to snowball. There are rumors they are cancelling all citizens passports ar the start of the year.
<p> I doubt she'll show her face all week with the way the economy is going. Maybe she can play the sympathy card for a seriously ill leader and just stay in her house pretending to be sick for a year or so, only leaving her house to scream about the Falklands
<p> He has multiple identities. He has an anal fixation, and it seems he has a desire to be a woman, and could well be a pederast. He has been fulfilling those fantasies by pretending to be "Susana Brown" of Tempe Az.
<p> He thinks it gives him status and attention from the other Argentinians to say he lives in the US.
<p> The address he gave us and boasted about, was actually a cockroach infested slum. He knows nothing of the US and ignores requests to prove he lives there. We gave him simple instructions, but got no reply.
