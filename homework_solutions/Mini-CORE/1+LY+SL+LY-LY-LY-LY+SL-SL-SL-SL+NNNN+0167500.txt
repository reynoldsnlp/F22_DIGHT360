<h> I Want To Know You For A Long Time Lyrics - Hall & Oates
<p> Laughing's short but loving lasts I can't mix the future with the past Can I stay close to you I wanna stay close to you You've got yours and I've got mine And what we have in so hard to define Just take a look at your life line You've got a lot to shine Let's say baby, I wanna know you for a long long time Ooh baby I wanna know you for a long long time
<p> Oh darling, lady friend We'll see each other when it's time to show Just for a minute or for a year But then again, don't you and I know
<p> A time between our time together It doesn't exist, it grows old forever Just take a look at your life line Oh baby, you've got a lot to shine I know it baby, I wanna know you for a long long time Oh and baby,
<p> I wanna know you for a long long time I wanna know baby, I wanna know baby Oh you've got a lot to live girl So I wanna know you for a long long time I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know baby So much to live for girl, So much to live for girl So I wanna know you baby Wanna know you for a long long time. I wanna know, wanna know ...
