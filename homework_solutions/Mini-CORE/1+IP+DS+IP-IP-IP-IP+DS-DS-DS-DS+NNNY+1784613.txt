<p> In many instances we often don?t know the history behind things. Through my research I found that the early childhood rhyme There Was An Old Woman Who Lived In A Shoe was actually based upon this story. I hope you enjoy it
<p> Once on a time there was a Lit tle Old Woman who lived in a Shoe. This shoe stood near a great forest, and was so large that it served as a house for the Old Lady and all her children, of which she had so many that she did not know what to do with them.
<p> But the Little Old Woman was very fond of her children, and they only thought of the best way to please her. Strong-arm, the eldest, cut down trees for firewood. Peter made baskets of wicker-work. Mark was chief gardener. Lizzie milked the cow, and Jenny taught the younger children to read.
