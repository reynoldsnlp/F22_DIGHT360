<h> Kind Women
<p> The few friends that I have and know me well make fun of me often for liking terrible shows and sitcoms. I was thinking about it a bit today, as I was catching up on Fran Drescher's tweets, and I kind of realized one reason why I get so drawn into shows like Reba and The Nanny .
<p> I enjoy themes of family led by kind women.
<p> It's by no means a definitive thing about me, nor is it particularly grand in my discovery of it, but I just thought it was interesting to realize that little bit about myself.
<p> In the case of Reba , I always joke that I love the show because she's just a good Christian woman. She loves her kids, no matter how stupid they are. And they really are stupid. The jokes and the writing are simple enough, but I think there is a warmth to the show that I really enjoy. My favourite part about it is Reba's relationship with Barbra Jean because it's one of the biggest examples of kindness. It's not done in a preachy way at all, but Reba's reluctance to make peace with her ex-husband's wife carries themes of forgiveness and tolerance. And what I appreciate is that while Barbra Jean technically should have been the evil "other woman," the show made her out to be so awesome and lovely. Dudes, I love Barbra Jean.
<p> With The Nanny , there is something about Fran Drescher that gives me a similar impression. There's weird mother-ness to Fran that I really like. Even with the show revolving around an inappropriate Fraulein Maria, it was never really a question of whether or not Fran could take care of the children. It was almost a given that she was that way. It was just Mr. Sheffield's weird commitment issues. And while I kind of think the last season really went to hell in a handbasket, there were parts of it that make me imagine what Fran Drescher was like while the show was still going.
<p> Perhaps it's a reflection of how I feel about my own unconventional mother, who was our family's breadwinner and also covered up her kindness with some kind of non-standard veil. She would never say dumb, lovey, wishy-washy shit, but she was always clear in her actions that she loved us. When it came to her children, there were very few limits. And I like to think that it was a great lesson to pass on to us.
<p> Apart from how to make ghetto midnight snacks like boiled Spam and Vienna sausages in our pajamas, that is.
<p> The other thing is that I get the impression that these women are genuinely kind. They don't seem pretentious, nor do they try to be more than they are. I really like that. The aspiration for me then becomes about achieving the same genuine quality, rather than more materialistic endeavours. (Although I do still get that feeling when I see shows like The Good Wife or Damages . Now that's another breed of women I also aspire to be. In a balanced way, of course. Fuckin' love Christine Baranski.)
