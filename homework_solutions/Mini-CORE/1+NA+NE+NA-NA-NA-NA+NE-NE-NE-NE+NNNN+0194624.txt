<h> 'Safety glass may have been used in Chalk attack'
<h> Marissa Calligeros
<p> A drinking glass allegedly used to injure a man in a fight at Brisbane's Chalk Hotel on Saturday may have been a shatter-proof safety glass, the pub's manager has revealed.
<p> The same type of tempered glassware may become mandatory in 74 Queensland pubs and clubs as part of a State Government bid to cut down the number of alcohol-related glassing attacks.
<p> The irony of this is that under the government's definition of 'glassings' and 'glass', if tempered glass was used, the assault should never have been called a glassing.
<p> Unlike regular glass, tempered safety glasses are designed to crumble into small pieces, similar to a car windscreen, reducing the risk of serious injury.
<p> On Saturday, 26-year-old Aaron Townsend suffered severe eye and facial injuries when he was allegedly struck with a glass that was thrown across a dance floor at the Chalk Hotel in Woolloongabba.

<p> But Chalk general manager Jason Titman told the brisbanetimes.com.au the pub had begun to phase in tempered glass six weeks ago and 50 per cent of the hotel's glass stock had been replaced with tempered safety glasses under the Chalk's "best practice" policy.
<p> "If a glass was in fact used in the assault it may very well have been a tempered glass," Mr Titman said.
<p> "The irony of this is that under the government's definition of 'glassings' and 'glass', if tempered glass was used, [the assault] should never have been called a glassing.
<p> "The public should not jump to the conclusion that every time there is an assault [at a licensed venue] it is a glassing."
<p> It is understood police are now investigating whether a glass had been used in the assault or whether the 26-year-old victim was instead pushed to the ground, hitting his head on a table, and repeatedly kicked.
<p> Mr Titman said CCTV footage showed that the alleged offenders were in the venue for 11 minutes before the assault occurred.
<p> Mr Townsend, of Laidley, west of Brisbane, was on the weekend placed in an induced coma and underwent surgery to save his eye.
<p> Mr Gulbis-Paris, a labourer, is now subject to a 12.30am curfew. He is scheduled to reappear in court on December 21.
<p> Mr Titman conceded two glassings have occurred at the Chalk Hotel in the 18 months to October, but said the figure was low considering 4000 patrons passed through its doors each week.
<p> However, the third assault is expected to see the pub banned from using glasses under proposed state legislation.
<p> The State Government has identified 74 "high risk" venues across Queensland, which have been issued with show cause notices to establish whether they will need to trade regular glass for tempered glass or plastic.
<p> Mr Titman yesterday said the venue was considering seeking civil compensation for losses to the business as a result of Saturday's incident and any additional compliance costs the hotel may face.
<p> He said replacing regular glasses with tempered glasses had increased the pub's annual expenditure by 30 per cent.
<p> "We are happy to comply with the government's recommendations, but have to get back to making the individual responsible for their actions," he said.
