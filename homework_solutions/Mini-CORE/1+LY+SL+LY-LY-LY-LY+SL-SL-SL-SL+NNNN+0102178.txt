<p> Watchin' the sun come up Like I've never seen it before I've been gone for a long time There's no place to hide anymore I feel the light on my face Touchin' me down to my soul Waking up from a bad dream Something I had to let go Can't blame anyone For all of the damage I've done I had to face myself Before I'd fall down I found I could turn around
<p> [Chorus:] Walkin' away from the edge While I can still live to tell Coming back from the dead On the road between heaven and hell Freedom comes day by day Till the demons are out of my head Walkin' away from the edge... Walkin' away from the edge ...
<p> You don't know how lost you are Till you're spinning out of control Before you know it you've gone too far Left the rest of the world far below Friends are gone one by one I'd pretend I'm alright on my own My disguise just starts wearin' thin Until all I've become is alone I reached out to anyone Who would tell me what I'd want to hear But I'm the one who could save myself I couldn't look down I turned around Before it was too late
