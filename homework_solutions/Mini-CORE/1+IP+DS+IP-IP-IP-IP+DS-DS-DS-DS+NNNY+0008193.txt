<p> If either our Kitsilano Blue or Kitsilano White editions become top-voted designs on FlyingFlips, they'll go to production and could be a kicking in a pair by summer. And you can feel good about buying a pair.
<p> Giving-back is at the core of FlyingFlips as a philosophy for our business and the community we're building. At the heart of our mission to give back is the Give-a-Flying-Flip program. For EVERY pair of flips you buy, we give a twin pair to someone in need!
