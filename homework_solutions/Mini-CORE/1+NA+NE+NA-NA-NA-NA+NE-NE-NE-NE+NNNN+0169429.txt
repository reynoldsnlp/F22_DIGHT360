<h> Magpies determined to play in a way to make McCarthy proud
<h> By Jared Lynch
<p> COLLINGWOOD is determined to rally together and play in a way that would make John McCarthy proud in its semi-final clash against West Coast this Saturday night.
<p> McCarthy, who was delisted by the Pies last season before being drafted by Port Adelaide, died after falling about nine metres at Las Vegas's Flamingo Hotel this week.
<p> Star Collingwood midfielder Scott Pendlebury said today the 22-year-old's death had "certainly put football into perspective" and "it's something that we are not going to get over".
<p> "But at the same time we've got an opportunity to play in a way that J-Mac would have been happy with and the way that he plays football: hard working, hard at the footy and I'm sure the boys will be wanting to play that way for him," Pendlebury said.
<p> "All the boys have found out and are grieving in their own way. It's something that we are not going to get over by the weekend's game."
<p> He said the death had bought Collingwood's player group closer together and made them more determine to vanquish West Coast.
<p> "At times like this you never want to be by yourself and thinking about it. When we're together we can talk and look out for each other.
<p> "The good thing about our program is it's really predictable. We know what's going to happen today. We've just had a look at West Coast, how they go about it, so all the boys had to do was key in for half an hour this morning and have a look at them.
<p> "That's why our program has been so good over the last couple of years because we know what's coming. The boys need to lock in for an hour today and make sure our training session is really sharp."
<p> Pendlebury said the Pies, who lost to Geelong in last year's grand final, were determined to put last week's 38-point qualifying loss to Hawthorn behind them.
<p> "I haven't thought about going out in straight sets because it's not something that I want to do," Pendlebury said.
<p> "I think finals football is a new ball game, the pressure goes up and our boys have played in a lot of finals games and we respond really well in that sort of atmosphere."
<p> When asked how Malthouse looked in Blue, Pendlebury said: "I'm happy for him that he's return to coaching. He definitely looks ready to go and it was good to see him revving up you guys as well," he said referring to Malthouse's return to combative habits towards the media during his inaugural Carlton press conference.
