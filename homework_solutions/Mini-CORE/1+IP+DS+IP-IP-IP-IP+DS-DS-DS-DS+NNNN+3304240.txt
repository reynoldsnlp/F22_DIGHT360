<p> Some people think that as a Mortgage Broker in Ipswich, all I do is punch some data into a computer that then spits out a list of lenders and their loan products that you then make your choice from AND then I do the paperwork AND then get you a home loan.
<p> As a Smartline Personal Mortgage Adviser, I am so much more than a home loan processor ... not that there is anything wrong with that!!!
<p> Let me surprise you by saying that is being a loan processor is only about 10% of what I do for you as your Mortgage Adviser!!!
<p> People seek finance at many stages of their life:
<p> For some it may be to buy their first home or for others it is to refinance to keep their home after a divorce or a relationship break up;
<p> For others it is to use their home equity to start building an investment portfolio or start their own business;
<p> No matter what your reason for looking for a loan, there is always a personal story behind the request that I am privileged to get to share.
<p> In my role, clients share with me some of the most intimate details of their life that they would not even tell their family and friends.  Most of us do tell not anyone what we earn or how much we have in debt or how out of control our credit card debt maybe... BUT CLIENTS TELL ME!!!
<p> As your Mortgage Adviser, I need to know not only your CURRENT reasons for asking for a loan, I also need to understand any FUTURE plans you have so I can structure a home loan that works for you now AND into the future.
<p> I would say that 80% of my role as a Mortgage Adviser is one of a confidant to my clients and it is from this position that strong client relationships are formed!!!
<p> The remaining 10% of my role is liaising with your real estate agents, solicitors, conveyancers, banks, accountants and all other interested parties involved in your loan request to make sure everything happens with the least amount of stress to you.
<p> If you would like to experience what I can do for you as your Smartline Personal Mortgage Adviser, please contact me.
