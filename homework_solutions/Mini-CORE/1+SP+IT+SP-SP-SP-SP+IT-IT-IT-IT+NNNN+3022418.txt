<h> Romain Grosjean: The team won an incredible victory
<p> On the eve of the U.S. Grand Prix Romain Grosjean said that waiting for the coming phase and remembered the last race in Abu Dhabi ... Q: What is your experience of visits to the U.S.? Romain Grosjean : I've never been in the U.S., even went shopping in New York! In many ways, I was waiting for a new experience. In fact, I tried to make a short visit to the country after the Grand Prix of Canada, but in the end I did not have time for this. I am sure I will find a lot of interesting discoveries: a new country, a new culture, and of course, the new track - I always wanted to get that experience. Q: What do you know about motor racing in the U.S.? Romain Grosjean : Of course, NASCAR is very popular. I believe we can learn from them how to make a bright show for the fans. This is impressive. 500 miles of Indianapolis - another event that everyone knows. I hope all the fans, which we shall meet in Austin, will be as much fun as in this competition.
<p> Question: Lotus F1 came on this track along with Jerome. He told you something? Romain Grosjean : I talked to Jerome, so I have a small idea of what you can expect. In addition, I worked on the simulator, and studied the route on Xbox - it was easy to do during the transfers. So I have an idea about the ring. I do not think at this track is easily mastered, there are a few turns that seem to be a problem. The first turn looks pretty interesting.
<p> Q: The stage in the United States begins the last pair of twin races, and in the finale of the season was three. As much a grueling schedule? Romain Grosjean : It's hard work, we are constantly moving from place to place. Sometimes you wake up in the hotel and ask yourself, "In what country I am? '. The whole team is in a similar situation: pilots, mechanics, engineers, maintenance personnel - in a word, everything. We look forward to the opportunity to relax after the season, but will hold another two important races. Hopefully we can make a good score.
<p> Q: The last race did not go the way you want ... Romain Grosjean : I was not lucky, but for the team, which, together with Kimi won, it was a fantastic day. We were waiting for this victory, it's an incredible result for the whole team. I had a chance to score points, but, unfortunately, Sergio Perez in the heat of the fight back to the part of the route where I was driving. Nothing could be done, and Sergio was fined for the incident, in addition it has led to the emergence of yet another safety car. Mark Webber also suffered in the collision, but this time it had nothing to reproach me.
<p> Q: What feels the team won at last victory? Romain Grosjean : This is an incredible result for the team. It seemed that every time the victory was slipping away from us, but we continued to attack and were eventually rewarded. Kimi great job. The car was fast, but we did not expect to win this race, but we did it. Hopefully, from Austin, we will continue to perform well.
