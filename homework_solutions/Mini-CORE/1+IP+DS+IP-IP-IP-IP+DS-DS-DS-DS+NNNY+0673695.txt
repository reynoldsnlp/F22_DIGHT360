<h> Book Description
<p> This was my very first story written for children. It is written for a younger (3-4)age group. I feel more comfortable writing for older children, but that doesn't mean it is any less amusing, plus it holds all the values of what I believe a bedtime story should include. When constructed in free unrestricted rhyme, while reading along, children quickly begin to retain portions of each story. Once the child begins reading independently, these stories act as memory assisting templates to guide the beginning reader through their first reading selections. The reading successes of a child will fuel additional comprehension activities and help to jump start reading skills that greatly motivate the young reader. The length of this story is designed to be between 5-10 minutes, to act as a short break or bedtime activity.

<p> I do like rhyming books. This didn't quite flow in some spots for me with rhythm and rhyme. Some of it was just the text placement (wrapping sentences when a return, with the rhyming words on the end of the line would have helped break it up better). I read it both on my computer (cloud) and some of the text placement was off. When I read it to my boys, we used the Ipad (upright, single page view) and the presentation was good. It got a little silly (aliens, gremlins, ghosts) and I had to remind my boys were were talking about what the lump in his shoe might be (that question came so quick at the beginning that kids almost needed a reminder of WHAT we were talking about). Cute ending. I really liked the illustrations.
<p> This book is fun, interesting, humorous, motivating and snarky. I highly recommend this book to anyone. I'm often disappointed by children's books because the reviews are not at all like the actual book. But in this case you're safe. It's a great read and your kids will love it.
<p> I bought this book for my children s and, i found it is very good and also the title is very interesting, since it exactly resembled with the type of stories that my children s generally enjoys. They both are very fond of bedtime stories, without listening stories from me during their bedtime it's very hard to make them sleep.

<h> More About the Author
<p> A Canadian author with stories and style deserve attention, that are both a delight to read and to hear. Peter Collier began with writing free-rhyming stories for his own children. After receiving hundreds of enthusiastic letters from children and being approached by schools and libraries, to continually give readings, it wasn't until recently that the e-book format provided a conduit for sharing his quirky free-rhyming stories to a broader international readership. His homegrown originality and story creativity are well received, with new myths like the 'Snow Alligators', 'The Immovable Rock' or 'The Very Last Apple'; now considered creative milestones. Currently, there are 19 stories, some including illustrations, as bedtime reading for children of several age categories.
