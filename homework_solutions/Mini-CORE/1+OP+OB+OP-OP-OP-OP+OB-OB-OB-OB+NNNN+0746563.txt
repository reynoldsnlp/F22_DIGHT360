<h> Abortion: Why doctors should have the 'right to refuse'
<p> The issue of conscientious objection within healthcare has come to the fore, as Members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are set to vote on a resolution calling for the removal of the right of doctors to opt out of referring women for abortions. Proposing the motion, Christine McCafferty of the UK Socialist Group is concerned that 'the unregulated use of conscientious objection disproportionately affects women', and argues: 'There is a need to balance the right of conscientious objection of an individual not to perform a certain medical procedure with the responsibility of the profession and the right of each patient to access lawful medical care in a timely manner'. The resolution also calls for a register of doctors who object to abortion.
<p> The issue of 'conscientious objection' is a difficult balance of the right of doctors to withdraw from an act they think is wrong, and the right of individuals to receive legal health care. Those of us who champion reproductive choice are keenly aware of the problems that conscientious objection can cause for women -- particularly in countries where few doctors agree with abortion. Even in Britain, where abortion is widely available, many women facing an unwanted pregnancy are reluctant to involve their GP because they fear their doctor may judge them or even object.
<p> But maintaining this difficult balance is preferable, both on moral and practical grounds, to a system that would force doctors to act against their consciences. At BPAS, we think it is better that doctors with a moral objection to abortion do have the opportunity to opt out of services, providing they make this clear to patients and inform them about others who will help. Women seeking abortion deserve better than treatment from doctors who think they are sinning.
<p> Where there are problems with accessing abortion services, these can be resolved by changing the ways services are organised, rather than by forcing doctors to perform or refer for procedures to which they fundamentally object. For example, systems that allow women to refer themselves directly to an abortion provider circumvent delays that conscientious objection may cause, save precious GP time and help women to get sympathetic care. Such practical measures would avoid the illiberal implications of putting doctors on a 'refusal register', and be of more practical use to women, for whom access to abortion should be as straightforward as possible.
<p> Throughout October and November, The Independent Online is partnering with the Battle of Ideas festival to present a series of guest blogs from festival speakers on the key questions of our time.
<p> In an abortion, the baby is not in control. The baby is being subjected to a fatal procedure that is being forced upon him/her.
<p> In the death penalty, the State is voluntarily looking for a legally-sanctioned procedure.
<p> See, we can all play definitional games. It's not about "confusing" anything -- it is about a different ethical stance. And, unlike you -- or some of the others here -- I am not trying to force mine on anyone.

<p> Are you seriously suggesting that doctors should not be allowed to refuse to perform a boob job?
<p> Howard
<p> You may think it is all a game. I believe a person has rights over his/her body that a doctor must adhere to. A fetus is not a person. The State does not own a person's body. No doctor is being forced to do anything. They are free to leave a profession they should not have entered if they had ethical problems serving patients.

<p> "They are free to leave a profession they should not have entered if they had ethical problems serving patients."
<p> Rubbish. The 'structure' of medical ethics is that -- yes -- "a person has rights over his/her body that a doctor must adhere to." Hence, informed consent. Doctors may not do anything to a patient that the patient does not consent to. However, this does NOT equate to "the doctor must do whatever the patient wants."
