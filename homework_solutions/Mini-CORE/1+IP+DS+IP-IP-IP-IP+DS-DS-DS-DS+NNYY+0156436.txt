<h> Editorial Reviews
<h> Review
<p> "In his book, On Top of the Cloud Muller interviewed top CIOs about the challenges and opportunities of cloud technology, and how they've learned to lead their companies into a cloud-driven future. These transformational CIOs, as Hunter refers to them, are technology leaders, not followers. They function as champions of innovation and continuous improvement, a role that often requires them to be more like a CEO than CIO." (Monster.com, April 2012)
<h> From the Inside Flap
<p> "If your company depends on data -- and it's hard to imagine a company that doesn't -- you need a cloud strategy, today. Maybe 10 or 20 years from now, we'll invent a newer technology that will make the cloud obsolete. That day will come, no doubt. But for now, smart money is betting on the cloud." -- Hunter Muller, from On Top of the Cloud
