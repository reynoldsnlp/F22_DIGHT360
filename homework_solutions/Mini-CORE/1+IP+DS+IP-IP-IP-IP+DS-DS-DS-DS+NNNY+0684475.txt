<h> Introduction
<p> Ellen Rogers is a London-based all analogue photographer and filmmaker. To date she has been featured and interviewed in numerous magazines such as i-D magazine, Vice, Tank, Dazed And Confused, British Journal of Photography, The Guardian, Vogue IT, Glamour, Lula; Girl of my dreams, Pheonix Magazine, Harper's Bazaar China, Grazia IT and worked for fashion designers such as Charlotte Olympia, Piers Atkinson, Sorcha O'Raghallaigh, Maria Francesca Pepe and many more.
<p> Her time is separated between shooting fashion and personal work. Ellen has also been lecturing in various institutions around England, including London College of Fashion, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester College and Goldsmiths College. She has a monthly article at Lomography.com called 'Sepulchral' where she talks candidly about life as an analogue photographer.
<p> Ellen studied at Goldsmiths College and finished a master's degree in photography in 2007, she is 28 years old and lives with her partner Prizme.
<h> Process
<p> Ellen's work spans time with its use of traditional darkroom process blended with modern imagery in a hazy and emotive world into which we can only glimpse these fleeting moments. Each image is intimately worked on by hand using a wide array of secretive techniques practiced from a young age. Often the colours are abstract reimaginings that convey an enigmatic feel that is so distinct to Rogers' work.
<p> She confesses that a lot of the work is thematically based in history, folklore, literature and their marriage to her childhood. The work visits tragic events like the match worker's strike in the 1800s or the events surrounding the demise of the Iceni at the hands of the Romans.
<p> Rogers' work is a far cry from the contemporary digital realm where the work never truly exists and cannot be interacted with so intimately, it begs to be seen in the flesh.
<h> Finish
<p> All the prints available here are accurate reproductions of the original work approved by the artist herself. This has been achieved through a long process of calibration with professional equipment. The process used for C-Type printing is one that is steadily disappearing and has been chosen as it bears a close resemblance to the actual darkroom process used to create the work. The C-Types are printed on Kodak Professional Endura satin finish paper that is estimated to retain its colour and tone for at least 100 years.
<p> Gicle reproductions are also available for some of the pieces (see each individual piece for details) and offer a wider range of sizes but, unfortunately, don't capture the work quite as well. Please bear this in mind when ordering. They are printed on 225g Somerset watercolour paper and are estimated to hold their colour and tone for up to 75 years.
