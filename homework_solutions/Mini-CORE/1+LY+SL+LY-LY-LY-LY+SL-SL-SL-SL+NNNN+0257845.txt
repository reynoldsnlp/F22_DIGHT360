<p> there are certain notes on a piano that remind me of your voice but maybe thats just my runaway imagination maybe i should just take some of my own advice or at least my medication
<p> theres a lonely song on the radio that reminds me how much i miss you but i dont really listen to the radio these days i cant even remember the last time that i kissed you but it shouldve left me breathless yeah totally amazed yeah
