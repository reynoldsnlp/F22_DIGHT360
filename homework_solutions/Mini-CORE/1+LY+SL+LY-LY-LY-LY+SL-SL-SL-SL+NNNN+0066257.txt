<h> It Would Be You Lyrics
<h> Gary Allan
<p> It's hard describing a heartache All because it's a one of a kind of thing A serious injury, and a whole lot of endless pain If it was a storm, I'd compare to a hurricane, oh it's even got a name If it was a drink, it would be a strong one If it was a sad song, it would be a long one If it was a color, it would be deep, deep blue But if we're talking about a heartache, it would be you If it was a full moon, it would be a total eclipse If it was a tidal wave, it would sink a thousand ships If it was a blizzard, it would be a record breaking cold If it was a lie, it would be the biggest story you've ever told If it was a drink, it would be a strong one If it was a sad song, it would be a long one If it was a color, it would be deep, deep blue But if we're talking about a heartache, it would be you If it was a color, it would be deep, deep blue But if we're talking about a heartache, it would be you
