<h> Lukewarm Cable slaps down 'whingeing' City
<p> Britain will have to negotiate with the EU over a range of rules threatening the City in spite of David Cameron's veto, Vince Cable has warned.
<p> The Liberal Democrat business secretary only offered lukewarm support for the "whingeing" City in an article in the Guardian newspaper, however.
<p> He wrote that the voting system for single-market rules was unchanged by Britain's veto on fiscal integration plans - and that current proposals including restrictive solvency rules for institutional investors threatened the UK economy.
<p> "In a calm, un-politicised environment, all of these issues could be negotiated through qualified majority voting, as they have been in the past," Mr Cable wrote.
<p> "It is also unavoidable, since the veto hasn't changed the voting system for single-market rules."
<p> The Lib Dems have been the most hostile party to the City since before the general election and last week made clear their frustration with Mr Cameron's negotiating strategy in the Brussels summit.
<p> Mr Cable appeared to distance himself from Lib Dem hostility over the issue, playing down the significance of the financial transaction tax which prompted Mr Cameron's veto.
<p> He said it had generated "much phony emotion", implicitly criticising the prime minister, before highlighting its impact on Britain and concerns about it.
<p> "It is in reality a cynical raid on UK financial services -- or, more likely, the consumers of them -- to fund the EU budget. A perverse Robin Hood tax levied on the people of Nottingham to pay King John," he wrote.
<p> "This tax has however never been a serious threat to the City since taxes are governed by unanimity. There is scope for taxing banks more like the bank levy we have introduced."
<p> Mr Cable concluded by calling on politicians to "put the whingeing of the City to one side", instead concentrating on rebalancing the UK economy towards higher education, creative industries, advanced manufacturing and professional services.
<p> "The bankers don't speak for Britain; the coalition will not put their interests above the rest of the country," he concluded.
<p> Yesterday Britain refused to participate in extra IMF funding to bolster the eurozone - the latest in a series of negotiations which will take place throughout next year as the crisis develops.
<p> Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the Independent newspaper he felt 2012 will be "the most dangerous year in my life", predicting that the short-term attitude of European leaders risked a "massive catastrophe" on the continent.
<p> "This is about leadership. They have got to act and they can't," he said.
<p> "It is existential... when it happens there will probably be a crisis moment that puts things into deep freeze, making it hard to trade and hard to finance... the impact on growth and jobs is really dangerous."
<p> Mr Balls raised eyebrows by saying he would enter into a coalition with Chris Huhne and Mr Cable "tomorrow", in an unusually strong appeal to the Liberal Democrats.
<p> "They have got to decide whether they want to serve in a Lab-Lib Cabinet which is trying to protect the NHS, keep us a robust defender of the national interest in the EU and get unemployment down, or whether they are willing to go along with what they now find themselves bound into," he added.
<p> "As they sit there over Christmas and reflect what they are in politics for, there is a better way than this."

<p> Ed Balls-that says it all.Along with his wife,Yvette Cooper,he was responsible for the ridiculous spending of the last government which has put us in this terrible financial position. Like so many of today's politicians,he is an incompetent buffoon who could not hold down a job outside politics.God forbid he should ever be responsible for our nations finances. As for Vince Cable,he is no more than a bitter and sulky old man who is still furious at not being the leader of the Libdems.As I look at all today's politicians,I despair that we are served by a bunch, across all parties ,who will just lead us further downhill and subjugate us to rule from Brussels.Germany may have lost the last 2 world wars but they will end up ruling us in the not too distant future.
<p> Personally if I had a golden goose I would take care of it and look to improve its care so as to get even more eggs. The City lays the eggs. The fact Vince Cable has not grasped that one shows he is not up to his job.
<p> Since Ed Balls was one of the decision makers that caused the financial problems any comment he makes is best ignored.
<p> It is time for the leaders to act constructively for the benefit of everyone. In any crisis there needs to be a direction of hope. I have not seen one yet. Have you? David Cameron needs to start setting the agenda rather than just reating to the agenda of others.
<p> Well. We all know what you and your wife are in politics for don't we. - "Robust defence of our National interest in the EU"... As you did over 13 years...? - We know that your notion of the Education System was to dumb down everyone. We know why you liked PC so much. - But do try not to assume we are all as stupid as your goodself.
<p> Stinking hypocrite, Ed 'Talksaloada' Balls, the man whose idiotic ideas created the gargantuan deficit for the incoming government, really ought to keep his silly mouth firmly closed. This incompetent buffoon wielding power at Westminster again is a terrifying thought.
<p> Out of the EU, Out of the Euro, shut down our boreders and see how long Europe lasts without us. We should open up our trading partners again in New Zealand, Australia, India, South America and to hell with the EU it's costing us tax payers TOO much in Jobs, Immigration and Money.
<p> The financial markets are the only thing GB has got . The only economic hope now that the country is out of Europe for better or for worse is for us to become the off - shore and un - regulated home to all that the EU doesn't like ! So the PM and his "First past the post" parliament should just give the bankers and their "friends" whatever they want !
<p> Well. "Protect the NHS". Wonderful. Brilliant. Bring it on. - Does that include not worrying unduly about monitoring costs...?? - The "Dream" of an IT system that would "Change communication and information exchange for improved functioning of the NHS"....Comes to mind. - Finally been consigned to the dustbin. Proved to be impractical and unsustainable. - The cost....? A mere 2.5....BILLION. - Labour: Always there when least needed.
<p> So many Whingers these days- Delusional Whingers ie No. 10 & No.11. Ginger Whinger ie Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Its lucky we don't have any in Government:D (A common denominator may make this irrational:D)
<p> At last a grown up MP, standing in the face of adversity he bangs his drum for the people. Well done Vince. A man amongst boys, a journey man of substance, more than can be said for many and even more for those greedy men in the city and its biased supporters.
