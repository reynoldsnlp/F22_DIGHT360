<p> FROM RAGE TO RESPECT: The Gay and Lesbian Struggle Since Stonewall
<p> Provocative, enlightening, and highly entertaining, this trailblazing public television series documents the hard-fought gains and heartbreaking losses in the struggle for lesbian and gay equality. The Question of Equality weaves together rarely seen archival footage and eye-opening first-hand accounts to reveal some of the movement's most dramatic moments, from the Stonewall riots of 1969 to the visionary efforts of today's youth.
<p> "The Question of Equality" boxed set is stylishly packaged and each of the four parts (one VHS tape per part) is a self-contained view of the evolution and modern history of queer identity. In a highly entertaining format we follow the ongoing struggle for equitable (or at least reasonable) treatment by the law - and the struggle for equality in acceptance by family, friends, workmates etc. The video quality on these tapes is superb - and the stereo soundtracks will amaze you especially in Dolby Pro-Logic surround.
<p> So much care, energy and informed expertise has gone into making this series that they demand repeat viewings. Tons of valuable archival footage is combined with living treasures speaking from personal experience.
<p> Men and women are equally represented - and for a change people of colour are given a strong voice. Queer youth are seldom adequately represented in media, but "Generation Q" deals with their real life & death issues and needs and calls for older queer activists to have the guts to fight in support of queer youth rights (rather than cowering in paranoid fear of paedophilic accusations).
<p> The Question Of Equality provides the best quality entertainment while informing and empowering viewers to be proactive in improving their own lives and those of future generations.
<p> Just as relevant now (2005) as it was in 1995, and equally relevant to viewers, like myself, outside of the USA.
<p> This PBS special was filmed and put together very well. My personal feelings that that come up in me tend to be disappointed in how much of the films also gives a sort of false impression that the struggle is subconsciously over when you view it. Hollywood often does this is general and all issues. However, it goes fairly into drawing the beginnings of the Gay Movement in America, the hypocrisy of how the Gay Activists Alliance got born and subsequently died out, the nasty effects of the religious right movement starting with Ronald Reagan & Anita Bryant through Jesse Helms. It also documents many brutal murders (hate crimes) effect on the gay community and on public opinion. But George W.'s administration and 9-11 had not happened yet. So their are some historical holes and left leaning idealism that is not a present as it once was, today in 2009. So from an historical point of view it is awesome. It would be interesting to see an undated version made now or even 5 years from now. But this is very good. VERY GOOD!
<p> A perfect introduction to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender history (from Stonewall to 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'). A must see for all interested in queer studies and those who simply want to know more about their neighbors, friends, and family members! Be sure to have kleenex handy.
