<p> It is so close to Nottingham Arena - you don't even have to cross the road. We have stayed here before and it is always good. You have an appartment with all facilites, so you can cook a meal or do your washing if you want. Close enough to restaurants and shops if that's what you want, and attached to the Ice Arena so brilliant if you're going to a show there.

<p> Got upgraded to a double room
<p> Was put in room 18 as soon as we stepped out of the lift the whole corridor smelt like a Indian restaurant. And the room where it was coming from was directly opposite ours, we didn't complain but at the end of the night after returning from the show the smell was twice as bad, and at that time there is nobody in reception to see just a duty number for on call manager.

<p> The facilities are excellent, even including a dock for you to play your own music from iPod/iPhone/iPad. Apartments are spacious and fully equipped with everything you need during your stay. Rooms are comfortable and tastefully furnished. Secure parking is available beneath the building. Short-term stays are also possible - I stayed just 3 nights. Fantastic value for money when you compare what you get in a hotel for the same or even more money. Simply the best option if staying in Nottingham.
<p> Bathrooms are dirty and have a large number of silver fish running about the floors. Iron was old and sticky, ruining one of my shirts. But still the best place I have stayed in Nottingham by far.

<p> Friendly and welcoming as usual. Got an amazing upgrade, so no complaints at all. Communication was good. Other than that, it was great. Will always stay here. I book because of the great check out time.
<p> The shower cubicle could do with a slip mat and a mat to step on when you get out, but I just use towels instead.

<p> They were modern, extremely comfortable, clean, light, very spacious and ticked all the boxes for our one night stay. We all decided we could have lived there!l
<p> The key fob to enter the building didn't work and had to be replaced, which meant we were stuck outside the first night of our stay until someone came to leave the building and let us in. Fortunately we weren't so late as to make it dangerous but it was rather nerve racking for a few minutes. The emergency phone number is written on the office door inside the building and can't easily be read from the door. So write it down when you leave just in case. On the second day they had changed the parking code and no one told us that was going to happen. So that night, when we were quite late back, we couldn't get in the parking garage either. Fortunately, someone came out after 10 minutes and let us in. Guests should ask for the new code each day.

<p> Loved the location and the view over the Arena. So easy to walk into some of the city's best restaurant and pub areas. We had space to relax and enjoy some time between the activities we had planned for the weekend. Much better than a hotel room.
<p> Unfortunately we picked the busiest weekend of the year in Nottingham so the price was at its highest.
<p> Location was excellent, views of the city where lovely. Staff friendly. Apartment was brilliant. Like a home away from home.

<p> Seemingly popular and good value, the 2 bed apartment was clean and ticked all of the basic boxes. We paid gbp125 but then the parking and internet are on top of that, so total was sufficiently higher that the nearby 16 Pilchergate becomes far closer in terms of value and much more comfortable. I would happily recommend Premier Apartments, excellent attitude from each of the three different staff members I met.
<p> Not much, all quite good really.
