<p> The Emmy-winning sitcom Two and a Half Men hits a peak in both character development and comedy in its sixth season. Change is the key to the season's appeal, and specifically in regard to unrepentant bachelor Charlie (Charlie Sheen), who finally begins to see the error of his hedonistic ways--in "A Jock Strap in Hell," he discovers that his fling with nephew Jake's former teacher (Alicia Witt) has pushed her into stripping--and even approaches something like a monogamous relationship with the spunky Chelsea (guest star Jennifer Bini Taylor). The maturation of Charlie's character, albeit brief, is a welcome surprise for the show, which all too often abandoned the ingratiating interplay between its cast in favor of crass bedroom and bathroom jokes. However, for those who appreciate that aspect of Men 's humor, fear not: there's plenty of it on hand in season 6, though stronger laughs can be found in the conflict between Jon Cryer's Alan, ex-wife Judith (Marin Hinkle), who's expecting her first daughter, and amiable new husband Herb, amusingly played by Drew Carey vet Ryan Stiles.
<p> The four-disc set includes all 23 episodes of Men 's sixth season, as well as several light and likable extras. Juvenile lead Angus T. Jones gets the spotlight in "Growing Up Harper," and his grounded, unaffected demeanor in the face of a hit show offers a refreshing alternative to the public's general feelings about young actors. Equally entertaining is "Let's Hear It for the Girls: The Women of Two and a Half Men ," which gives welcome coverage to its female cast, including series utility players Melanie Lynskey and Conchata Ferrell. An amusing gag reel rounds out the supplemental features. --Paul Gaita
<h> Product Description
<p> In Season 6, a smart, independent brunette named Chelsea may finally have turned party-boy Charlie into a man. The kind of man who brings you tea when you're sick. Sleeps over at your place, even if he can't watch ESPN in bed. Or makes the ultimate sacrifice: nukes the nudie pix off his cell phone. And there's lots more funny that keeps Two and a Half Men the #1 comedy on TV: Jake locks lips with the cute girl next door, the one whose football-star dad is named Mad Dog. Judith prepares for a midlife baby, who may end up looking a lot like Alan. And Alan dates his receptionist, then ends up in bed with her frisky mom. Life's a beach in Season 6!
<p> I'm a huge fan of this show, which over the first five seasons has maintained a fantastically high laugh count and developed some terrific characters played by some top quality actors. The writing is consistently brilliant and there's a great chemistry and balance between the characters and actors that make it a real joy to watch.
<p> So, Season Six overall is still highly watchable and remains streets ahead of other comedy shows on both sides of the Atlantic (I'm from the UK, whose last great comedy series The Office gave the USA the American Office, another great show).
<p> BUT... there are some cracks beginning to show. For example, a couple of the episodes - particularly the one where Charlie's new fiancee Chelsea is poorly in bed - just grate on the nerves. Watch it once, you won't want to watch it again. Which was never the case with any episode before.
<p> And it's the Chelsea character that also annoys. She arrives out of nowhere and suddenly Charlie, whose main humour factor has been his total lack of shame and remorse, suddenly becomes this drooling idiot apologising for his past.
<p> We already have that character, for pity's sake, in Alan... the show needs Charlie's 'anti-Alan factor' to keep the balance right. When both of them are emasculated berks under the thumb of ALL the female characters, the show loses its impetus, and starts to irritate its many male fans, like me, who only grew so devoted to it after seeing Charlie's self-centred attitude to women put up there as a refreshing antidote to every comedy series of the past 30 years, where the women are the streetwise, hip, all-seeing power-brokers and the men are just dolts.
<p> So let's have Charlie back as his own man, and ditch the Chelsea character. I mean, for pity's sake, would the Charlie of the first three series have allowed his girlfriend to move into his Malibu pad and turn his bedroom into that awful, flowery, chintzy feminine mess? Never!
<p> Also, like many comedy shows before it (Frasier, for example) as the series went on and on, it started to take itself too seriously and began turning into mawkish soap opera. Will Charlie ever find love and settle down with the right woman? Who the hell cares?
<p> Finally, one great thing about this DVD is the seven-minute compilation of out-takes on the extras on Disc 4... worth the price of the set on its own!
<p> If your a long time fan of Two and a Half Men, or even if you aren't, you will love season 6. This is the season where we find Charlie Harper growing up a little bit, and at the same time staying as immature and conceited as possible. We watch all of our favorite characters develop new story lines of their own with Alan having had a small fling with ex-wife Judith and wondering if her pregnancy is a result of him or her current husband Herb. We also find Alan with another possible romance with his receptionist Melissa. Meanwhile Charlie is remaining as hilarious as ever with his new wife-to-be Chelsea. The only one criticism I have is that of the character Jake who has lost a great deal of his appeal morphing from a cute and hilarious little pre-pubescent to a stereotypical teenager who eats too much. The character, however, still has his moments, just not as much as he used to. All in all it is a hilarious season with a great twist season finale! The season finale ends with just as many questions as laughs with Herb Melnick's character going into full "Ryan Stiles" mode with the actor playing the character Herb as if he were back on the hit ABC show Whose Line is it Anyway.
<p> This is as great as the first five seasons.They just seem to keep getting better and better.The writers for this show are great in the scripts they do for the show.I hope the next three seasons they got coming up are as great as these are.Jon Cryer and Charlie are perfect for this show.Congrats to Jon for his Emmy award.
