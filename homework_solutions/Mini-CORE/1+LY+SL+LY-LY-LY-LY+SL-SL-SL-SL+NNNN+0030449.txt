<h> Turning Tables Lyrics
<h> Adele
<p> Close enough to start a war All that I have is on the floor God only knows what we're fighting for All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me I can't give you what you think you gave me It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see Where love is lost, your ghost is found I've braved a hundred storms to leave you As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no I won't ask you, you to just desert me I can't give you what you think you gave me It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior When the thumb that cost me Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no I won't ask you, you to just desert me I can't give you what you think you gave me It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Turning tables, yeah, turning

<p> I just listened to the song twice to make sure I was hearing it correct. It is "ask you." Not rescue. I know sometimes it's hard to to hear her clearly cause of get style of singing but she is pretty clear at that part

<p> You would think someone would correct the lyrics on this one, as there are a lot of mistakes (the funniest of which is, to me, "when the thumb that cost me" instead of "when the thunder calls for me") doesn't change the fact that this song is amazing, though!

<p> These lyrics are wrong. I have the official song book and it's recuse you, not ask you. And it's the heart you thought the gave met, not what you thought you gave me. amazing song though

<p> It is "rescue" and "the heart". The first time I heard it I thought it was saying the other lyrics, but I listened to it with the right lyrics and you can definitely hear it! Plus it makes more sense with rescue than ask you... Thank you for posting the correction.

<p> It's ask if you listen to the song
<h> David29334
<p>  Feb 4, 2012
<p> no, believe me, its rescue. it's a little hard to hear, but if you listen closely enough, the lyrics are I won't rescue, you to just desert me and The heart you thought you gave me
