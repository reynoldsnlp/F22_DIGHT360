<p> If you're a dude with a red Mohawk who recently got lucky at a Motrhead/Megadeth concert in the bathroom at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago -- or if you know a dude who matches such a description -- you totally need to keep checking the Missed Connections section on Craigslist. The woman with whom you had an encounter has something that was left behind.
<p> "Did we hook up at the Megadeth/Motorhead concert? - w4m - 28 (Aragon Ballroom)," reads the anonymous post that was live through Thursday:
<p> Anyway I'm pregnant. It's yours. contact me if you want to be part of your child's life.
<p> Rather than judging this young woman -- and you know you are, jerk -- let's help her out. Consider the near impossible odds of the Craigslist Missed Connections for reconnecting with any random encounter.
<p> Take you , for example. The hottie you stared at a little too long at Starbucks this morning is not looking for you. Of that you can be 99. 9 percent sure.
<p> What's more, according to those same statistics I totally made up just now, if he or she is posting about you on Craigslist -- the creep who stared at him or her a little too long at Starbucks this morning -- it's not in your city's "Missed Connections" section. The hottie is doing it somewhere in the community or discussion forums in a post tagged FML , the NSFW  acronym used by texting teens with obtuse parents and Craigslisters bemoaning their unfornatuate -- or in your case, creepy -- life circumstances in the community and forums sections of the online classifieds site.
<p> If we take blue hair/silver tube top at her word -- because of course, nobody ever lies on Craigslist -- she isn't a creepy stalker, but a future mom looking out for her impending child. Like everyone else these days, she's using social media of a sort to get things done. So spread the world so she never has to have this discussion with her young head banger: "It's not that your daddy didn't have a Facebook account, I just don't know his name ..."
