<p> In the back of the bottom drawer Of the dresser by our bed Is a box of odds and ends that I have always kept But the man who sleeps beside me Doesn't know it's even there Little pieces of my past That I shouldn't have to share
<p> A napkin that is stained with time Has a poem on it that didn't quite rhyme, but it made me cry In a 'Dear Jane' letter from a different guy He broke up with me and he told me I'm not always right And a stolen key from an old hotel room door In the back of the bottom drawer
<p> I don't keep these things 'cause I'm longing to go back I keep them because I want to stay right where I'm at I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs I don't want to mess this up But I wouldn't know where I belong Without this box of stuff
<p> A birthday card from my first boyfriend He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car And those Mardi Gras beads from '98 We danced all night, stayed out so late We thought we were stars, closing down the bars That champagne was cheap but still I've got that cork In the back of the bottom drawer
<p> I'm not trying to hide these things from the man I love today But I'm a better woman for him, thanks to my yesterdays
<p> So now I try to give more than I take And I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say it's my way Or no way at all And now I cherish love a whole lot more 'Cause of what's In the back of the bottom drawer
