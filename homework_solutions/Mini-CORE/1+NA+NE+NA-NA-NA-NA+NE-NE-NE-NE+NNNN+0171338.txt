<p> For those, in an era of waning union influence, the West Coast longshore union has flexed its muscle. The result has crippled Northwest international commerce, scared ships away from Portland and knocked a hole in the recovering regional economy.
<p> The International Longshore and Warehouse Union's bitter dispute with another union and the container terminal operator leaves Oregon's governor, U.S. senators, business leaders and other organized labor on the sidelines, issuing occasional indignant pronouncements. But that's not the whole story.
<p> And yet, the longshoremen's fight is about far more than two jobs. The West Coast's 21,000 longshore union members are threatened by automation. They appear prepared to use every tool in their considerable arsenal to protect their turf and to acquire additional maintenance and repair jobs that can't be automated away.
<p> The immediate squabble at Terminal 6, the Port of Portland's international container yard, concerns the equivalent of two positions plugging, unplugging and monitoring refrigerated containers, or reefers. Longshoremen muscled electricians off the jobs in June, according to ICTSI Oregon Inc. , a subsidiary of a Philippines-based company that began operating the cargo hub last year.
<p> Longshoremen say their West Coast collective bargaining agreement with the Pacific Maritime Association entitles them to the reefer work. Port officials say the work belongs to the electricians, as it has for 38 years, under ICTSI's lease terms. Pending a legal resolution, the Port and ICTSI have agreed to let the longshoremen keep manning the plugs they commandeered.
<p> Why would longshoremen care so much about a couple of positions at one port? Union spokeswoman Jennifer Sargent didn't return calls Wednesday. But people in the industry said the most likely possibilities include:
<p> A legal decision making the West Coast labor agreement cover Portland, while unlikely, could be interpreted to give longshoremen a dozen more electricians' jobs fixing cranes at Terminal 6.
<p> A willingness to bet the farm for two jobs could make longshoremen appear formidable ahead of labor negotiations this fall with Columbia Grain Inc., which ships goods from another Port of Portland terminal.
<p> A desire to show ICTSI who's boss as the terminal operator begins managing its first U.S. port could motivate union leaders to push boundaries.
<p> Of these possibilities, automation stands out as the most sweeping international trend.
<p> In New Jersey, members of the ILWU's East Coast counterpart, the International Longshoremen's Association , have protested plans to install equipment that will transfer containers between trucks and stacks.
<p> "We have good, family-sustaining jobs that we fought for and maintained for generations, and today those are hard things to come by," said Dennis Daggett, president of the ILA's Atlantic Coast District, in a Star-Ledger article in January.
<p> The ILA and the ILWU are reportedly considering an alliance to protect against encroachment by non-maritime unions and non-union employers.
<p> During the 2008 negotiations on the current West Coast collective bargaining agreement, longshoremen and managers discussed maintenance and repair work that could offset robotics and other new technologies expected to displace traditional jobs. Negotiators agreed that longshoremen would get to do such work, other than "red circled" exceptions at certain ports.
<p> No work at the Port of Portland was red-circled because the port didn't belong to the Pacific Maritime Association, which ICTSI later joined. But the exercise underscores longshore concern that port improvements will displace jobs.
<p> Elsewhere nationally, unions have suffered setbacks, including labor leaders' failed attempt to recall Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and votes in California cities to cut municipal pensions. The longshore union has taken hits as well, blaming the Teamsters for taking over an ILWU local in California and the AFL-CIO for undermining longshore causes.
<p> But the ILWU has also won victories, demonstrating its enduring power. At the Port of Longview last year, longshoremen stormed a grain terminal and blocked a train, protesting terminal operator EGT's hiring of members of another union.
<p> A federal judge held the ILWU in contempt and fined the union. But the union prevailed, as EGT agreed to hire longshoremen.
<p> The Longview case is apt to be on Judge Simon's mind Thursday as he weighs a motion by the National Labor Relations Board's Seattle office to hold Portland longshoremen in contempt for allegedly defying his order banning slowdowns. But Simon hinted during his last hearing Friday that NLRB lawyers face a high bar to justify a contempt finding, and more challenges arguing for penalties.
