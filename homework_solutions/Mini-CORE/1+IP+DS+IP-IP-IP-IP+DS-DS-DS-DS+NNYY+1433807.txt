<h> Review
<p> 'After giving us the once-over about the basics of cheese making, we then get to the nitty-gritty with Paul's wonderfully researched cheese-making recipes.' Rochdale Observer. 'This is a cracker of a book. Beautifully laid out and written. If you are considering developing your cheese making skills and becoming abit more self sufficient I thoroughly recommend this book.' www.cottagesmallholder.com.
<h> About the Author
<p> Author Paul Peacock has been making cheese at home for many years.
<p> He was inspired by his grandmother who made cheese every day of her life, collecting the milk from various sources in wartime Manchester, setting it by simply allowing the milk to sour, and washing, hanging and eating the resultant cheese on a sandwich for her evening meal.
<p> Paul is also an expert on plants and gardening and writes as Mr. Digwell for the Daily Mirror`s Gardening Advice web site. He can be heard on BBC Gardener's Question Time and is the editor of Home Farmer magazine and author of many books, including Patio Produce, The Urban Hen, and with his wife, Diana Grandma`s Ways for Modern Days.
<p> I bought this having zero knowledge of cheesemaking hoping it would be a good beginners book but found that it lacked in giving a good understanding of how different cheeses are made as well as lacking in precise instruction for a novice. For example, 1 sachet of mesophilic starter is called for at the start of most recipes but the sachet I bought is enough for 100 litres of milk! A few more paragraphs explaining about starters would have made the world of difference. Blue Stilton calls for the curds to be "washed" (whatever a wash is) with a 100ml Penicillium roqueforti solution while other Blue cheeses the Penicillium roqueforti is mixed at the start with the milk and starter. Why? Some are left for 45 minutes after adding rennet, some for an hour. Some are heated to 30 initially, others to 34. I can follow recipes but without an explanation of what I'm doing I will never really understand how to make cheese. When I have some more experience and understanding then maybe it'll be a good book to return to for recipes but for now I'll have to move to cheesemaking forums.
<p> I bought this based on reviews of others and as a complete cheesemaking novice. There is enough information given to produce cheese and on that basis I think it is a good purchase. I have only made cheddar so far and although I had a few questions during the production process it would seem, from the end result, that the instructions given are adequate if you also apply common sense.
<p> We found the instructions in this book very clear, and easy to understand. The recipes are mouth watering and very tasty. This book is not only a very good read but, would help children understand all about cheese
