<p> The global mobile security market is expected to witness faster pace of growth over the next five years, led by growth in enterprise-led security services, reaching $10.7bn in 2017, according to a report by ABI Research.
<p> Though application and hardware security are the foundation of mobile security, the market will be mainly driven by mobile-centric security services, the report revealed.
<p> With mobile platform maturing over the years, the mobile security services will cater to the demand for managed services, cloud-based security, endpoint management, security readiness assessments, penetration testing, and other professional services.
<p> Mobile security services will mainly target the enterprise sector, with the BYOD trend fast catching up and the enterprises continue to assimilate mobile devices into their organisations.
<p> ABI Research senior analyst Michela Menting said securely managing a growing number of devices within the enterprise is becoming a real issue as more and more workers use smartphones and tablets to perform core company tasks.
<p> "The different phone brands, operating systems and versions place a growing burden on IT staff, often requiring separate security solutions to be tailored to each device type," Menting said.
<p> According to the report, some enterprises will hike their spending in-house to address this issue; many companies will opt for mobile security services from specialised third party service providers.
<p> In terms of region, the European market is expected to witness stronger demand for comprehensive services, including remote security management and technical support.
