<p> For More Than Glory ( 2003 ) (The fifth book in the Legion of the Damned series) A novel by William C Dietz
<p> "When it comes to military science fiction, William Dietz can run with the best," says Steve Perry .
<p> And he proves it once again in his newest novel about the foreign legion of the far future--and the battles no one else can fight but General Bill Booly. Now, in the wake of a great universal war, he's found himself struggling to balance his military, political, and humane obligations. But neither Booly nor his men realize on the remote world of LaNor, another revolution is brewing. There, a career Legionnarie with a reputation for bucking authority and an inexperienced, overly-ambitious diplomat will become key to defending the deadly LaNorian web of terrorism that threatens not only the Legionnaires, but the entire Confederacy.
