<p> 3/10/12 ... and unfortunately this show has just been cancelled 'due to insurmountable legal and zoning issues between the venue and the council' -- guess thats why we don't see too many dance performances in warehouses...
<p> Imagine a large, spare industrial warehouse space -- all steelwork and exposed structural rafters, internal void, concrete floors, shadows, and natural light filtering through frosted grid windows. Now, instead of a Tarantino interrogation, imagine this space coming alive with the physical poetry of beautiful, articulate contemporary dance in an immersive installation experience. Laura Summers and Maximilian have chosen such a space to tell us about the moment before logic arrives in the body through a series of short contemporary dance pieces and video works they've called dance+anecdote. We had a chat with them about it.
<h> Tell us about dance+anecdote...
<p> dance+anecdote is a series of short new contemporary dance works, both live and filmed, that are presented in a breathtaking warehouse space: manysquaremetres .
<h> What inspired dance+anecdote?
<p> The very first moment of inspiration was Laura's... but it was kind of indirect. After seeing a music video that was filmed there, Laura became infatuated with the space (as everyone seems to) and decided it was the perfect backdrop for a short dance film project she was working on with Heidi McKerrow. They filmed that short at Manysquaremetres earlier this year and were really blown away by how gorgeous the light was and the cinematic, epic quality of the space. When registrations for this year's Fringe Festival came up, Laura invited me to join her as co-deviser for a show of short works. We struggled until the very day before registrations closed to find a conventional venue, then realised our ideal scenario was manysquaremetres, and approached them.
<h> How is that space shaping the production?
<p> The space has the most immediate impact imaginable- as soon as you enter, you feel like dancing, or at least I do, and the volume and the grid naturally affects how you move. It's a very dynamic, very live space. And every time I walk in, ideas come to mind quickly. For an industrial space, it's surprisingly warm and personal.
<p> When we started the project, we felt relieved because we both already had choreographies set and ready-to-go, but once we spent time in the space, that changed completely and we wanted to make more site-specific work. It's been the same with the dancers. The dancers all have distinct personalities, and we both want to work with that, not against it.
<h> Tell us about your dancers...
<p> We've chosen all the dancers very carefully. We have dancers from the Homemade Dance collective that Laura and I are involved in. We're also working with Geoffrey Watson (recent graduate from Australian Ballet School) and Yuiko Masukawa and Imanuel Dado (both recent graduates from WAPA). For me, the dancers' personality is definitely the starting point of making works.
<h> Tell us about the name...
<p> We wanted a name that was broad enough to not impinge on the diversity of the works, a title that wouldn't restrict the way the works are interpreted by the audience. 'dance+anecdote' also reflects the episodic nature of the performance -- constructed of a number of short ideas, visions that are brief and fleeting, scattered throughout a large space, coinciding in the same place and time but not necessarily constructing a grand narrative.
<h> I understand that you are both designers by day and dance makers by night, how do you manage that balance?
<p> Interesting notion: balance! We both find it challenging, but we feel a compelling desire to dance and to make. The greatest thing about having two producers on this show is being able to play tag-team when we have other commitments. But we both have creative jobs that are fulfilling in their own ways too.
<p> MAX: We're both very visual people, and I think that helps with seeking quality in presentation. I just think that once you start considering design in any realm the attitude for assessment required comes into play in whatever you do, in everything you create. For me, my background is draping and couture, which I consider essentially as kinetic sculpture, and it's the same principle with dance. Interestingly, I know a several accomplished dancers who explore fashion in a similar way.
<p> LAURA: My design practice addresses screens, mobiles and other devices which are becoming more and more infused in our daily lives. An on-going theme in these pieces has been to investigate the idea of this integration of devices into our lives and consciousness. Phones/computers/tablets arrive with  a very specific set of movement vocabulary and visual conventions which have provided intriguing, funny, dark, and intimate moments as we've worked on translating and mapping that vocabulary onto the human body.
<h> You're crowd sourcing funding for the project, how is that going?
<p> This is the first time we've used Pozible , and it's working well. Whenever I'm on Pozible, I love finding out about people's projects -- it's actually a very personal and direct way to be involved in great creative projects. We also believe very strongly in creating a supportive culture within our team of cast and crew, and I think crowd-sourcing is a great way to share the culture. Right from the start, we wanted our funding site to be about sharing the culture of the show. Our Pozible site is a bit different in that we're consciously offering an exchange. In return for donation, we've created exclusive gifts that involve sponsors in the behind-the-scenes life of the show.
