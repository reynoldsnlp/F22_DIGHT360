<h> Sebastian Vettel Q&A: We have to go on full attack in Austin 04 Nov 2012
<p> The aim was to leave Abu Dhabi still leading the drivers? standings and Red Bull?s Sebastian Vettel managed to do just that, albeit in a much more tumultuous fashion than he had ever imagined. After keeping his nerve following his disqualification from qualifying, Vettel managed to zoom through the field from a pit-lane start to eventually finish in third. What an achievement! He reviews his race and looks ahead to Austin
<p> Q: Sebastian from P24 to P3 in 55 laps. How satisfied are you with your race? Sebastian Vettel: Ha, I don?t think I zoomed through the field just one time - I think I did it twice. Believe me, it is quite a piece of work to make your way up one time, but two times is indeed quite something. Somehow it was fun and the result is pleasing. It was a conciliatory ending to a tumultuous day. Sure the safety car played to my advantage. In that phase I was on the soft tyres and even a win didn?t look out of reach. We started the race with the clear aim of finishing high up and bagging as many points as possible and it worked! I am pretty satisfied.
<p> Q: How important for your confidence was it to do well today after being disqualified on Saturday? SV: Very important. But it is more important that you don?t see such a blow as a blow because then you don?t have to pick up the pieces again! I think the whole team took the decision very calmly and immediately concentrated on changing the set-up to raise our chance of getting into the points.
<p> Q: Toro Rosso youngster Daniel Ricciardo was didn?t really help you today SV: Yep, that was a bit of stupid situation. He didn?t close the gap to the cars in front and was braking very hard. At that moment I was probably not concentrating 100 per cent and was surprised. I was on the right and couldn?t give way to the left and there it was - the board. In a moment the front wing was completely gone. That was not really pleasant as I had already moved far ahead and had to join at the back again.
<p> Q: You leave here still leading the standings. How excited are you about Austin? SV: I am looking forward to the next race very much. I have not added points to my tally but also I haven?t lost as many as a start from the pit lane would suggest. We have to go on full attack in Austin. Let?s see what we can achieve there.
<p> Q: The Austin track is new territory for all and Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko said that he doesn?t care what the track is like as the RB8 is the fastest car right now. What?s your feeling? SV: Yes, we have been fast in all the last races and even if we didn?t have the best car on the grid we could take.
<p> Q: You could wrap up the title in Austin? The ?match point? is yours SV: First we want to exhale and relax for a few days before we focus again. And yes, if the chance is there why not make it game, set, match to stay with the tennis terminology! (laughs)
