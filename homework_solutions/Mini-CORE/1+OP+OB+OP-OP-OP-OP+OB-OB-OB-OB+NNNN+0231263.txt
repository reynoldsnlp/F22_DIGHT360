<h> It's been a year of not thinking things through
<p> The more George and John drop their bombs, the more it makes everyone, even those who have the most to gain from liberation, determined to resist, writes Terry Lane.
<p> It hasn't been much of a year. In fact it has been a dismal 365 days. And yet, as I write these words, I realise that for many people - indeed for most of my compatriots - it has been a brilliant year.
<p> When war was in prospect most of us were against going off to kill Iraqis without permission from the United Nations but, once the blitzkrieg was under way, we got into the spirit of the thing.
<p> There were major distractions. For a few minutes we all knew the name of the woman from Tasmania who won Big Brother. She was the toast of Hobart. But I'm damned if I can remember her name today.
<p> Then there was the renovation of the flats in Sydney that commanded our attention for a few more minutes. We were much taken with Gazza and Woz (or Wozza and Gav?) who, being a homosexual couple, are at the vanguard of the New Normal.
<p> After which came Australian Idol, which I didn't get the hang of, but seemed to be some sort of talent quest. The winner was so famous for several minutes that thousands of Adelaidians turned out in 42-degree heat to hear him perform in the centre of town. Several fainted and one finished at death's door; that's how important this person was. Or still is, for all I know.
<p> Then there was the international rugby competition and the Man of Steel's unsportsmanlike behaviour. That was fun.
<p> So who could spare even a minute amid all this excitement to worry about murder in Mesopotamia? And as for the ongoing crusade to civilise Afghanistan, psshaw! We've forgotten that already.
<p> Except that I read something yesterday that seemed to encapsulate the sheer stupidity, misery and impossibility of the civilising crusade to which the Prime Minister has committed us. An American woman, travelling in Waziristan (the territory between Pakistan and Afghanistan that succours and shelters the Taliban) writes of the woman with whom she is travelling: "She could be exiled, as her female cousin was for watching television alone with a male cousin at night. He was killed (by outraged Muslim male neighbours or relatives); she reportedly escaped after being gang-raped."
<p> The writer asks another Waziri woman how many children she has and the woman replies: "Two. Three if you count the girl."
<p> I am in a turmoil. You have to ask yourself: "What is there on television that you would risk rape or death to watch? Big Brother? The Block? Waziri Idol? Is the sheer hypnotic pull of the idiot box so powerful that it overrides prudence?"
<p> Then I think, if George and John's great adventure really had any chance of ridding the world of this sort of cruel, ignorant misogyny, I would cheer them on.
<p> But the more George and John drop their bombs, the more it makes everyone, even the women who have most to gain from liberation, determined to resist.
<p> The American woman writes that during the war with America (and us - don't forget us!) "hundreds of men from the surrounding villages went to Afghanistan after the local madrasa broadcast a call to jihad via its loudspeakers. Although jihad is nothing new here, the tribal move to join them is."
<p> In other words all that the invasion of Afghanistan has achieved is to move a bunch of primitives who normally mind their own business to get stuck into the fight against the invading infidels, with the women urging them on.
