<p> Top Gear: The Worst Car in the History of the World
<p> A very special Top Gear Special, presented by Jezza and Capt. Slow Esq. In fact why don't we let them introduce this particular slice of petrol heaven?
<p> Everyone has an opinion on bad cars... Now it?s time to hear the ones that really count ? ours...
<p> As it?s the worst car in the history of the WORLD, we?re on our travels ... to the North of England...to name and shame the most rubbish car from a manufacturer which, frankly, should have known better.
<p> But, it?s not all about hateful cars...Oh no. You have to revel in some good ones to appreciate the stinkers. There?s the Ferrari 458 spider, Toyota?s GT86 and the ?340,000 Lexus LFA rubbing shoulders with a Mercedes SLS.
<p> Our guest driver, the Stig?s Yorkshire cousin, puts his whippet to one side and throws a BMW M5 round a gymkhana course before we have a go in a couple of Transatlantic challengers. Things don?t go well.
<p> We argue over the great and the awful from Peugeot, Ford, Mahindra, FSO, Alfa Romeo, Rolls Royce, Porsche, Citroen, Peugeot, Saab....and many more.
<p> And we have a special, surprise fate in store for the car we pick as our biggest loser...
<p> Enjoy .... Jeremy Clarkson James May
<p> Includes an UltraViolet digital copy of the Blu-Ray so that you can instantly stream and download the programme to your computer, or compatible Android, iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch devices.
