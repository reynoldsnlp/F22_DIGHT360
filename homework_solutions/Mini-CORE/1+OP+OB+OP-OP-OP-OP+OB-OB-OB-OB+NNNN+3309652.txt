<h> 255 members of the National Academy of Sciences defend climate science integrity
<p> For too long, scientists had detached themselves from the public debate to concentrate on their academic work or to avoid vicious attacks by the deniers throwing up red herrings such as the so-called Climate-gate scandal (a scandal that has been debunked by two British investigations that concluded "the basic science seems to have been done fairly and properly").
<p> Whether sequestered in an ivory tower or locked in a bunker mentality, scientists were too often absent.
<p> Now, they are reclaiming their place in the debate by defending themselves and their work -- and urging action.
<p> A few days ago, the journal Science published a letter from more than 250 members of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences which included 11 Nobel Prize laureates to condemn "the recent escalation of political assaults on scientists in general and on climate scientists in particular."
<p> To skeptics and deniers, and to those who maintain the spurious argument that there is no scientific consensus, the scientists wrote: "There is always some uncertainty associated with scientific conclusions; science never absolutely proves anything. When someone says that society should wait until scientists are absolutely certain before taking any action, it is the same as saying society should never take action."
<p> "Society has two choices," say the 250 letter-writing scientists with the National Academies of Sciences. "We can ignore the science and hide our heads in the sand and hope we are lucky, or we can act in the public interest to reduce the threat of global climate change quickly and substantively. The good news is that smart and effective actions are possible. But delay must not be an option."
<p> By speaking out more forcefully and clearly, scientists are helping refocus the debate from "is man-made climate change real?" to "what can we do about it?"
<p> By doing so they're performing an invaluable service in the discussion over climate change -- they're helping clear the air.
<p> It's about time don't you think? Now if we could just get more citizens and politicians to start taking action perhaps we will have a chance even if a slim chance.
