<p> Why? What I really liked about it was it was a very thoughtful, well-planned process of involving people at different levels, like the city level. It was really good for me because I work with  bringing grassroots people together. So this gave me an idea of the real importance of involving all the stakeholders of the city together.
<p> Everyone had to be a participant at all levels of the city: the politicians, business people and advocates. I really liked this. It said everyone was on the journey together: everybody had a stake, everybody realizing their interdependence and what every person has to offer to build a healthy city.
<p> How do you plan this share this Good Idea?
<p> I feel very passionate about people coming together and the idea of people mutually respecting one another, so I plan to share with my own organization, the other organizations I work with. I certainly would like to talk to a group of people about using this model in our city.
