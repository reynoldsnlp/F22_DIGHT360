<h> I Think I Will Lyrics
<h> Faith Hill
<p> Think I will What would you say if I said something strange That made a difference, and how you feel? What would you do if I did something out of the blue To make the world a better place? Oh I think, I will Gonna change for our break Gonna take your heart And can make it mine this time, Oh I, I think I will Oh, I'm gonna run till I find Another way to make you mine in time Oh I, oh I think I will I think I will What would you give if I give you everything? And that's for nothin', how would you feel? What would you think if I thought about doing something good? Yeah, just to make you smile Oh I think, I will Gonna change for our break Gonna take your heart And can make it mine this time, Oh I, I think I will Oh, I'm gonna run till I find Another way to make you mine in time Oh I, oh I think I will, yeah Takin' it slow puttin' right goal More like no other think I will Longer I go stronger I get How positive I think, I will Takin' it slow longer I go And more I can know our things that well Longer I am there stronger I get How positive I think I will Gonna change for our break Gonna take your heart And can make it mine this time Oh I, I think I will I'm gonna run till I find Another way to make you mine in time Oh I, I think I will, yeah Gonna change for our break Gonna take your heart And can make it mine this time Oh I, I think I will I'm gonna run till I find Another way to make you mine in time Oh I Gonna change for our break Gonna take your heart And can make it mine this time Oh I
