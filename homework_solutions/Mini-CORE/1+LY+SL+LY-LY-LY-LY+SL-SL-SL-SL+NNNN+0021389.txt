<p> I've been runnin so fast I didn't see the world pass me by Just kept spinnin on without me
<p> Monday turned to Friday like a blur January was July And I don't know why
<p> Been poppin pills and seeing shrinks Tellin me all about my anxiety
<p> I just need some time to break away, from this state mind I want to find a lighter side of me Always try to please everybody thinks I'm so strong But sometimes I get weak They give me all their remedies When all I really need, is a little more time for me
<p> I want the love of my life all the things that money can't buy Peace of mind Life like this would be the sweetest dream, But right know it's not my reality
<p> I just need some time to break away from this state mind I want to find a lighter side of me Always try to please everybody thinks I'm so strong But sometimes I get weak They give me all there remedies When all I really need, is a little more time for me
<p> Time to breathe, time to be me, time to learn Time to fall, time to save myself from it all
