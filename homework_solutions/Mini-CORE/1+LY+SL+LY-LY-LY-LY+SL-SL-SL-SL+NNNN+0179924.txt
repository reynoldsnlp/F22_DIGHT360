<p> Burning bridges never felt so right We watch the night embrace our hexes light Hesitation won't exceed these wishes The stone, the sling, our stadiums in stitches If the stars were black and skies were white We'd still will these flames upon this sight To the moon our skulls are tightly bound We with no intention to come down
<p> The day they proved the earth was round Was the day they flattened holy ground The sea it sang an orphaned sound "The earth is flat it is not round!" (It's upside down)
<p> Everybody's trying to be borderline Don't you know that mystery will never be defined? I wouldn't trade my rags for riches Pursuit for power doesn't faze a mystic To the moon our skulls are tightly bound We with no intention to come down
<p> The day they proved the earth was round Was the day they flattened holy ground The sea it sang an orphaned sound "The earth is flat it is not round!" (It's upside down)
<p> Days are pending you're pretending That your life is never ending These back handed compliments of nature Have us on the fence I don't think you really know where you're going We can't escape what captivates us now Laughter is gonna keep us alive Sabotage is gonna make us into kings and queens
<p> The things that people do when they think no one's looking
<p> When you're (sic) beginning has no end You witness all the things that never happened
<p> Money doesn't make the world go 'round It's in the center of the universe we should drown Your eyesight will be tainted by control Unmask yourself prepare to fall into giant hands And know freedom
<p> The day they proved the earth was round Was the day they flattened holy ground The sea it sang an orphaned sound "The earth is flat it is not round!"
