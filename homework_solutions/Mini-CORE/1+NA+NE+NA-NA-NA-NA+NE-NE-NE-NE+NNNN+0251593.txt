<h> After chasing richer parts of the UK, prices start to go downhill in the Valleys
<p> Not long ago property journalists were reporting how Welsh house price rises were bringing the Principality into line with wealthier regions of the UK.
<p> But the latest figures from the Land Registry, for property transactions completed in April, show dramatic falls from Cardiff to Anglesey. While there are widespread local variations, the overall picture is bleak; the average home costs 153,864, some 5.9 per cent down in a month. The rot set in at the end of last year as separate figures from Halifax show prices dropping from as early as Christmas.
<p> Even so, the country has done well in recent years. 'Since the first quarter of 2003, house prices in Wales have risen 71 per cent compared with 56 per cent for the UK as a whole,' says Guy Ogden of Halifax estate agents. 'In the 10 years since 1998, Welsh house prices have increased 188 per cent, slightly higher than the UK average of 176 per cent.'
<p> But if the worse-than-average falls of the first quarter are repeated throughout this year, that trend will be thrown into reverse.
<p> Doing well
<p> Although every single county of Wales showed a price fall in the first quarter of 2008, some are still in the black when you look at price changes in the year since spring 2007.
<p> The Vale of Glamorgan rose by 13.6 per cent, Denbighshire and Monmouthshire are each up by more than 4 per cent, and there have been minor annual rises for Ceredigion, Powys, Carmarthenshire, Neath and the Rhondda Valley - but the prices of apartments in the Rhondda have plummeted 30 per cent in recent months, so problems may lie ahead.
<p> Doing badly
<p> There were drops in prices of 10 per cent or more in the first quarter of the year, according to the Land Registry, in Merthyr Tydfil and Pembrokeshire. Meanwhile Torfaen, Conwy, Swansea and Newport reported drops of more than 8 per cent.
<p> Beverley Morgan & Co, an estate agency in Torfaen, gloomily predicts: 'There seems a lack of confidence, especially from first-time buyers. We would anticipate that there is likely to be a high proportion of repossessions in the near future unless the market is stimulated.'
<p> According to Kelvin Francis, who runs an estate agency in Cardiff: 'Instruction levels are lower, reduced by vendors who do not have to sell at this time and can wait for a recovery in the market. Offers are still being received, but often below vendors' expectations.'
<p> Cardiff Bay, a regeneration success story over the past decade, has an excess supply of apartments aimed at the now-elusive buy-to-let landlord but is not in as desperate a position as city centres in northern England. None the less, new flats on sale are being offered by developers with reductions of up to 15 per cent.
<p> Tell-tale signs
<p> Darlows, a Welsh-branded estate agency chain owned by Spicerhaart, has shut its Llanelli and Neath offices and is not selling homes from its Swansea branch, preferring instead to concentrate on lettings. The Peter Alan agency has shut up shop in Mumbles, one of the most affluent areas of south Wales.

<p> After advising tourists against travel to the cities of Jammu and Srinagar for nearly 20 years, the Foreign Office has lifted its guidelines after a fall in violence. So, Dal Lake and part of the Valley of Kashmir, one of India's most beautiful regions, are once again open to visitors
