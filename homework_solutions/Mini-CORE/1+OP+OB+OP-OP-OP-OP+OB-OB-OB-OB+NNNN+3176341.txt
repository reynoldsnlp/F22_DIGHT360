<h> I think this really needs to be said.
<p> I've seen this everywhere, including on a lot of fat/body positive blogs. This, in my opinion, is more rampant than the shaming of skinny women and might even equal the shaming of fat women. It's a bit tied in with skinny shaming though:
<p> THE SHAMING OF ANOREXIC WOMEN.
<p> Can we please stop?
<p> Don't call yourself body positive and then snark and about how ugly skin and bones are. It's all very well if you include a disclaimer that you don't mean naturally skinny women... So then who do you mean? Women with a legitimate mental disorder who desperately need help and acceptance rather than shaming?
<p> Seriously, it's very hypocritical. Let's all stop making disparaging comments about anorexic women.
<p> I never really understood what reviling the bodies of anorexic women was supposed to accomplish anyway. Body shaming is not the way to reach out to people with this illness. What's more is that once one starts talking about how revolting 'skin and bones' are, he or she starts down a slippery slope that can end in language that denigrates all thin women, equating all of them with those with eating disorders.
<p> I had a friend who struggled with an eating disorder, and when she overcame it, she was still a petite but much healthier-looking girl. However, it continues to be a struggle for her to accept her body, because of this kind of body shaming that continues in even some well-intentioned resources for body acceptance.
<p> You are pretty brave to bring up this issue on your blog. Keep up the good work.
<p> I totally agree! It's isn't fair and it's just as cruel. No one is better than anyone else because of how they look, the kind of body they have or don't have. I too am sick of it. "Real women have curves." is not only not (necessarily) true but degrading, just as degrading as some larger (any larger) is less of a person or less of a woman or not as worthy. I've noticed this a lot too with larger women trying to reclaim their confidence and thats ok what's not ok is treating someone or saying mean things and trying to lessen someone's worth because they aren't like you. A size 0 is just as ok as a 24 or a 4 or a 12 or a 16 or a 6. All women are beautiful. All shades all sizes.
<p> Absolutely. I, and the fat acceptance activists I surround myself with, certainly call people out when we see this. Body shaming in all its forms is terrible, but it's body shaming someone with an illness like anorexia is on a whole other level of bullshit.
