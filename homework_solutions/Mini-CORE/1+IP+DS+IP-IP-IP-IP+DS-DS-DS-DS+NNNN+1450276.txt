<p> When her dying father confesses that he is not her biological father -- and that he has a twin -- Washington, D.C., morning news anchor Ellery O'Brien is desperate for answers. Plagued by a recurring nightmare in which a blood-covered woman who has been stabbed repeatedly by a killer, staggers down the staircase of a beautiful old house, Ellery travels to her late mother's hometown -- Agarita Springs, Texas -- not realizing until she arrives that she has rented the very house she sees in her dreams. No one in town wants to dig up the past, but rancher Clint Littleton begins to help Ellery and white-hot attraction sparks between them. The nightmares, however, persist. And each time, before Ellery awakes, she sees an increasingly terrifying image: just a little more of the killer's face. . .
<p> New York Times bestselling author Elaine Coffman switches gears with pulse-pounding results in her first novel of heart-stopping romantic suspense.
