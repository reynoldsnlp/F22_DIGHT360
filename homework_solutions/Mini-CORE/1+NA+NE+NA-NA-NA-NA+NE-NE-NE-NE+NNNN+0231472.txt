<h> Salmond wants to join a club, but only if he can play by his own rules
<h> After the Nato rebellion, will loyal SNP members develop a taste for mutiny, asks Alan Cochrane
<p> ALEX SALMOND'S narrow escape in his bid to overturn his party's opposition to Nato, begged two larger questions last night: why would the Atlantic alliance agree to him changing its rules of membership just for him, and has his party faithful at last found the courage to challenge his vision of independence more often?
<p> With a majority of only 29 out of more than 750 delegates, the First Minister got his way but needed all the oratorical powers of his senior ministers and ex-ministers to defeat an essentially grass-roots rebellion against ending the Nats' opposition to the Atlantic alliance.
<p> The Perth conference yesterday backed Mr Salmond in a passionate, noisy and generally good natured debate, of which more later. But first of all we should examine the hopeless incongruity of what the Nats have done.
<p> They've said that as Scotland is currently, through the United Kingdom, a member of Nato it should, as an independent country, continue to be a member. However, in seeking to be so, its negotiators -- step forward the aforesaid Alex Salmond -- would tell the alliance's bigwigs that they'd only continue as a member "subject to an agreement that Scotland will not host nuclear weapons".
<p> It's called "conditionality" but it's actually a virtual negation of what Nato is all about; it is a nuclear alliance and its members accept as part of joining that they enjoy the shelter of what's always been called the "nuclear umbrella".
<p> Angus Robertson, the Nats' Westminster leader and general bogey man of the fundamentalists, was the lightning conductor for the leadership and he was the only one heckled and booed by a small section of the huge crowd in his wind-up speech which presaged the leadership's narrow win.
<p> As the successful campaign manager of the two recent election victories, he persisted in reminding the party that their best ever result was the 44 per cent they achieved in the 2011 Holyrood election. He said that they needed 50 per cent-plus-one in the referendum to gain independence and the only way of getting to that figure was to accept the fact that 75 per cent of Scots wished their country to remain in Nato.
<p> He was aided and abetted in rescuing Wee Eck principally by Kenny MacAskill, the justice minister but also by John Swinney, the finance minister, Keith Brown, the transport and veterans' minister and ex Royal Marine who fought in the Falklands, and Bruce Crawford, the SNP's former business manager.
<p> And never one to hide his light under a bushel, Mr Robertson afterwards declared, to loud guffaws from the press room: "Who dares wins."
<p> Twenty four hours earlier Mr Salmond had described the UK, after more than 300 years of relatively harmonious existence -- even allowing for the odd rebellion -- as a nonsense. But if that was true what price his bid to join Nato? Surely that application, if it ever comes to pass, could only be described as arrant nonsense, laughable even. After all, the SNP leader wants to join a club where, if he's accepted as a new member, he'd ignore all the existing rules and seek to play by his own.
<p> There is little doubt that the opponents of joining Nato had the better of the moral argument, insisting that it would be "hypocrisy" for an SNP-run independent Scotland to seek to join the alliance, given its hostility to nuclear weapons.
<p> Elsewhere, I have no doubt that Mr Salmond's use of the "nonsense" word when he talks of the UK will deservedly haunt him in the two years leading up to the referendum. It is one thing to say that the voters have been mistaken in sticking with the UK for all those years, entirely another to suggest that they've been little more than idiots to support a nonsensical Union.
<p> But while he may well regret that vocal spasm, most of his other efforts are designed to avoid scaring possible supporters. We've already had support for the Queen, Commonwealth, pound and Bank of England; now we see another attempt at calming any possible fevered brows. However, now that they nearly beat him over one of the planks of his independence-lite policies, will the SNP membership now develop a taste for such mutiny?
<p> It would be interesting if that was the case but the smart money must surely be on the likelihood that, having had their little bit of excitement, they will retreat once more to their loyalist laagers.
