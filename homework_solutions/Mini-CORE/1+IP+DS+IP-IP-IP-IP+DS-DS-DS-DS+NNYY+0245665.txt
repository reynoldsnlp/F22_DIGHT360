<h> Want to learn to think about photos the way the pro's do?
<p> Have you ever wondered how professional photographers seem to get great images time and time again?
<p> Well yes, it does have a bit to do with the fact that they take a LOT of photos (one of them is bound to be good) but more importantly, there are many different ways of thinking about a photograph before you ever click the shutter. Photographer's Mind aims to show you how to look at images with a new eye, avoid visual clich and develop your own distinct style.
<p> So without further ado, this week's eBook bargain (50% off the usual price!) is Photographer's Mind by Michael Freeman.
<p> Available on Kindle here and the iBookstore here . Non-US residents only for this one folks.
