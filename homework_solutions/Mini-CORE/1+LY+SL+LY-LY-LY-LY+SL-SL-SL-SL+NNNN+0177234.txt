<h> Original Lyrics
<p> Performer: Anna Rossinelli Song title: In Love For A While Song writer(s): David Klein Song composer(s): David Klein
<p> I looked into your eyes, And when I saw your smile I knew right from the start, Life is good for a while.
<p> Romance comes and goes, But a love like ours is here to stay Each lovely night and sunny day.
<p> I love everything about you, I couldn't do without you Whenever you're near me All my days are on the bright side But when I'm not around you I have to find the way to be with you Each night and every day.
<p> Na nanananana, na nanananana na Na nananana...
<p> And as time goes by And we've seen stormy weather I know that you and I, Were only getting better.
<p> But when I'm not around you I have to find a way to be with you Each night and every day I love everything you do I couldn't do without you, I love everything you do I have to find a way to be with you I know you and I, are in Love for a while.
