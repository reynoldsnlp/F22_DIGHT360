<h> I Think You Get What I Mean Lyrics
<h> Nat King Cole
<p> My grammar ain't so good And I've got no Ph.D But there's more important things Than a college degree I think you get what I mean I think you get what I mean Your chick is all that matters I think you get what I mean There are ways to keep her happy Ways to lose a tune I don't take advice of no one I know just what to do I think you get what I mean I think you get what I mean Your chick is all that matters I think you get what I mean You give her lots of kisses And dine her with good food Work to keep her cheerful And in a loving mood I think you get what I mean I think you get what I mean Your chick is all that matters I think you get what I mean There're times when she'll stay out late And you'll be feeling blue Go on out and have a ball, son She'll come running back to you I think you get what I mean I think you get what I mean Have yourself a ball I think you get what I mean
