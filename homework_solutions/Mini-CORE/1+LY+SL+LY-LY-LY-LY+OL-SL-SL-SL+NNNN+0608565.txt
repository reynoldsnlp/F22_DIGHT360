<p> I Can See Clearly Now
<p> D G D I can see clearly now the rain has gone G A I can see all obstacles in my way D G D Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind C G D It's going to be a bright, bright sunshiny day D G D I think I can make it now the pain has gone G A And all of the bad feelings have disappeared D G D Here is the rainbow I've been praying for C G D It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day F C Look all around there's nothing but blue skies F A G F A Look straight ahead nothing but blue skies C#m G C#m G C D6 A D G D I think I can make it now the pain has gone G A And all of the bad feelings have disappeared D G D I can see clearly now the rain has gone C G It's gonna be a bright, bright D D Sunshiny day
<p> (As far as I can consider it's basically: G, C, D all through, so try to get through then) Spend a long time on my own last night I think I spent a little bit over the top It's just something in a bottle Made me feel right And I think that's why I couldn't stop The man beside me Had the warmest look of understanding in his eyes As I went on about the laws the barriers and things That came upon me and my kind I'm just trying to get through We have words but sometimes words say too much But they don't say enough The boy meets the girl Sometimes they sail smoothly And sometimes it's rough I remember like a little child Kicking against a stone wall That I built myself I won't give in now I won't feel guilty I'll just rise up I'll have to be myself I'm just trying to get through I'm just trying to get through So help me I'm trying to get through Can't you see I'm trying to get through Help me through So listen people what I tell you now Life is hard but it's worth keeping on Listen people what I can tell you straight It's not too late to try and get through I'm just trying to get through...
