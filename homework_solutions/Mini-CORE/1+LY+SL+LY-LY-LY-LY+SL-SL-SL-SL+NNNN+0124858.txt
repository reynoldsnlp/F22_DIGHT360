<p> If it's really over and there's nothing I can say I'll do my best to hide the pain and turn and walk away But do me one last favor and pretend you're hurting too After all we've been through it's the least that you can do
<p> I don't know any reason we should let the whole town know Which one of us came up with this plan for letting go Try to leave me just a little pride to get me through After all I gave you it's the least that you can do
<p> When you run into our old friends Could you ask them how I've been And maybe even muster up a teardrop now and then And if they ask you how you're doing What's it really gonna hurt To tell a little lie and do your best to look your worst
<p> Keep my old love letters in the closet down the hall And leave at least one picture of me somewhere on the wall Could you do your best impression of a sentimental fool After all it seems like it's the least that you can do
<p> I know it won't be long till someone else is loving you And waking up in your arms just the way I used to Promise me at least one time you'll call him by my name When I'm with somebody new I'll try to do the same
<p> If someone ever asks you why we went our seperate ways We were just too much in love might be the thing to say Or maybe you could tell them I was just too good for you After all I gave you it's the least that you can do
<p> If the shoe were on the other foot I'd do the same for you After all we've been through it's the least that you can do
