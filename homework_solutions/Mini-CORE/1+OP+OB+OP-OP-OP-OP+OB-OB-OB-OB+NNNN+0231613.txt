<h> Commercial Break: Just when you thought it was safe to type the word 'Dear'...
<p> "It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?" No. Fuck off Clippy. Remember Clippy? He's the paperclip-shaped knobwit who would infect your work on Microsoft Word with his inane questions and offers of assistance.
<p> Thankfully he was killed off before Microsoft Office 2007 hit the streets, but now he's back, with a cameo role in this ad for the forthcoming Office 2010. In keeping with the spirit of the recent IE8 promos that starred Dean Cain (soon to be seen in 'Parfection: The Golf Movie' and 'The Dog Who Saved Christmas') Microsoft have gone for the quirky humour pitch with an action movie pastiche.
<p> Like those aforementioned ads with the man from 'Max Havoc: Ring Of Fire,' it's all a bit hit and miss. Our favourite bit is right at the start where the important man speaks of a 'rogue font' although to these ears, he sounds more like an Aussie warning us of a 'rogue fart.'
<p> At least Clippy isn't coming back from the dead. Ultimately, that's all we really care about.
<p> What a fantastic piece of marketing! It's so absolutely absurd that it's absolutely terrific. Although if it was realistic, that Office helicopter would have crashed mid-flight. Also they would have gone around arresting random, innocent people for "performing illegal operations"
