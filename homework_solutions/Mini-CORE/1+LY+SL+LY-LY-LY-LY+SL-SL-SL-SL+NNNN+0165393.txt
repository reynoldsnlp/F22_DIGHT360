<p> I am everybody And everyone that I know is me Everyone that I know won't see
<p> I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer, yeah
<p> I'm another number And you know the numbers must agree But everytime the wind blows I can't fly - why?
<p> We take away tomorrow And never see the end of today Lock it up and send it away - forever
<p> [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dio/i\\... ] I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer Cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer
<p> Running with the wolf pack Feel like I'm never coming back But maybe that was sunshine That I saw
<p> I've heard about a rainbow I've heard it makes you crazy I think I'm goin' crazy Crazy cause I see
<p> I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer Cause dreams are what we are
<p> I could have been a dreamer I could have been the one to fly I always could have been a dreamer Cause dreamers never die, no!
<p> I could have been a dreamer Dreamer I could have been a dreamer Dreamer I could have been a dreamer Dreamer I could have been a dreamer
