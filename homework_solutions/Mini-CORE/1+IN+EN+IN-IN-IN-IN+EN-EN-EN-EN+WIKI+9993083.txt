<p> Bob Maconel (Slater) is a disillusioned office worker with ideas of murdering his coworkers. One particularly bad day, Bob goes from potential killer to inadvertent hero " coworker Coleman " goes postal " and shoots up the office before Bob does. Bob stops the shooter's plans by killing him with the gun he planned to use on the others, and in the process saves Vanessa's ( Elisha Cuthbert ) life. The former invisible nobody is suddenly thrown into the spotlight of public notice, he is considered a hero by those he wished to murder, promoted by a grateful boss to "VP of Creative Thinking" and given all the perks of higher management. Meanwhile, he saves the object of his desire only to have her ask him to end her life; her injuries have left her a quadriplegic .
<p> Vanessa asks Bob to let her roll down a subway platform in front of an oncoming train. Bob debates whether or not to go through with it, scrawling "should I finish what Coleman started?", on a piece of paper. Bob doesn't go through with it and he stops her just before she reaches the train. They then discover that she can wiggle her little finger, providing hope that she may recover. Bob and Vanessa become romantically involved. Bob is still trapped by the demons of his past, and has insecurities that as soon as Vanessa recovers, she will leave him.
<p> Finally it is revealed that Bob has been hallucinating all of the events since just before the initial shooting. This time, he is in the same position as his coworker was, only instead of killing his coworkers, he shoots himself in front of Vanessa. The last scenes show police searching his house to find a note that reads "you may ask why I did what I did... but what choice did you give me? How else could I have gotten your attention?" In the news with reporters interviewing his neighbors, they say that "he was a quiet man."
<p> In a first alternate ending, the lead-up to the shooting reveals that Bob is indeed the shooter and intends to shoot Vanessa (due to his frustration that she does not know he exists), but before he can fire a shot, Bob is himself shot several times in the chest. The scene reveals Coleman to be the hero in this ending, having shot Bob through the cubicle wall. As Bob's lies on the floor and his vision fades to black, he sees coworkers standing over him, with Vanessa being the last coworker, mouthing the words "I love you" before he dies.
<p> In a second alternate ending, all events of the first alternate ending come to pass. As Bob's vision fades to black and he sees Vanessa mouth the words "I love you," a faint beeping sound is heard. The scene then flashes to Bob, sitting in his cubicle, going through a normal day with the shooting having never taken place. Vanessa walks by his cubicle and comments on the hula-dancing figurine on Bob's desk. Bob removes a notebook from his desk drawer, and notes that today, Vanessa loved his hula girl. The image pans out to reveal a meticulously detailed log of all inconsequential events and interactions with Vanessa over the course of months (or even years). The book then closes to the end credits.
