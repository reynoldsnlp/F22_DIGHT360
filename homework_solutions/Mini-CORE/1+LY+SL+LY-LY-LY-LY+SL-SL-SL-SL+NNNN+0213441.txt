<p> I like watching films about ghosts I like saying anything goes I like knowing possibilities don't end I work harder than I want to I don't stop till I know the truth And I love each and every one of my friends I'd like to think that I owe regrets cause every single one of them made me who I am And I make sure that I never forget That my parents taught me that I can I'm learning the ways of the world one step at a time I'm learning the love and the hurt, the wrong and the right And I'm trying to be, the best that I can be For nobody else, nobody else but me I like to focus on the good stuff I like to think that I can be tough I like to hope that hope has it's own sound I have a routine when I wake up I never drink all the tea in my cup And I don't think that I'll ever get rid of the Couple of pounds that I'm carrying around I don't forget who I am when I'm faced with a hard decision I've learned to ask what's in my heart and trust the way that I am feeling
<p> HEARTBEAT
<p> Ba ba ba da da And my wondering's not going to waste I can tell with just one look at your beautiful face I can feel my heart beat in my chest And I hope that you will be the one to move next You're a little shy but so am I I could spend all night wasting time I can almost taste your lips on mine You're a little shy but so am I I like knowing that you like me too I like feeling like this wonderful and new I can see your heart beat in your chest Close your eyes and then we'll figure out the rest Hardly breathing Just believing That this could be What I'm dreaming of Ba ba ba da da When your dark hair falls into your eyes I can feel my heart beat with a warm delight When you move your hand to rest on mine I can feel my heart beat skip one or two times
<p> CHARLIE
<p> Charlie will you write me a love song? Like you never wrote a love song before? Charlie make it kind of vague but say my name So that everybody knows who you wrote it for
<p> Charlie I have known you for so long Every scar, every mark the way you feel in the dark Charlie we were so young then but we can still pretend This is our first time
<p> And I know I know I say I don't know if it's wrong or right But  now I think I might after all of this time And I'm scared to say it because let's face it a lifetime is long But I do not belong without you
<p> You make me more than I could be by myself, by myself I am sure now that I want it all now with you, with you So Charlie tell me do you want me too?
<p> Charlie it's been four short years With hopes and dreams and fears, with love and trust and tears Charlie I guess I worried that I was young That I was missing out on some but I am missing out on none
<p> UNLOVE SONG
<p> It's a cold night and I'm alone, I think about where we went wrong Where did we go wrong? It's a long time to be in love, but only time is not enough It's not enough
<p> Who's gonna hold me when I just need to be held? Who's gonna know me better than anyone else? Who's gonna love me if I can't even love myself? I always thought it would be you I can't believe it won't be you
<p> I think about how it was, I wonder when we got lost When did we get lost? I close my eyes and see your face, but then you start to fade away You fade away
<p> This is hard. My poor heart. Let me go. On my own.
<p> I KNOW THAT I'LL KNOW
<p> Setting out upon my path and not knowing where it goes Leaving everything behind leaving everyone I know It's a widely known fact such ventures can be Hard on the soul
<p> But I know that I'll know when I've come I know that I'll know when I'm home
<p> Hoping only for the best and then expecting nothing less As misguided as it seems following only my dreams It's a widely known fact that it is we who hold the Key to set us free
<p> Choices won't go away Decisions need to be made If I get one wrong I will learn and carry on I will not give up my hope I might falter but I won't I do not believe I can't There is faith within my heart There is faith here in my heart
<p> So although some time has passed I am holding strong and fast I am closer now I think to the wildest of my dreams It's a widely known fact that all we Need is to believe
<p> JUMP
<p> I'm a dreamer of dreams, a believer in things I say what I mean and I mean everything I love when there's love lost, I hope when it's hopeless I'm honest at all costs and I'm someone someone trusts
<p> But you make me more than I could hope to be And you take me where I have never been
<p> Tonight we are falling into something That's bigger than us Tonight we are falling into something That's bigger than us Don't think too much Don't think just jump
<p> You have a busy mind, a watchful eye You never tell lies and you carry your pride You like to stay up late, you never hesitate You love how I taste and you don't believe in fate
<p> Who are you lying by my side? It's been seven years and oh the time flies by Where am I in this crazy life? I got lost among the things I am running from
<p> But I don't know who I am without you.
<p> Maybe there's a way out of this without hurting anyone Tell me how I start to tell him I have fallen out of love
<p> I once knew you with the whole of my heart Fingertips on skin in the dark Routine and moving, drifting apart The water is deep and the distance is far
<p> WHAT I'M MISSING
<p> I thought I was going steady I thought I had it under control I thought that I needed nothing And I knew everything I wanted to know
<p> But then you, you came along And I knew I had everything wrong
<p> And I know how I'm feeling when you're laying with me I need to say this so listen you are what I'm missing I know how I'm feeling when you're laying with me I need to say this so listen you are what I'm missing
<p> When you put your arms around me I can feel my whole world change Baby when you kiss me slowly Nothing even looks the same
<p> If I show you who I really am will you Do 'most everything you possibly can will you Love me with your soul heart and more No second guessing you have got to be sure
<p> Cause baby I'm not asking much I just want to know that I can trust you With my love
<p> YOUNG LOVE
<p> In the start in the dark I didn't know What you felt like on the inside, but the outside view was quite nice Then we spent days in bed and time went slow We started out adventure as we ventured out together
<p> Knowing only That our love was growing
<p> Young love, young love nothing quite the same Young love, young love it changes in a day Young love, young love doesn't ask too much Young Love, young love I think we're old enough To know that this is much more than just Young Love
<p> You would ride your old bike to my house And we'd walk down to the seashore and talk until the nightfall Then one day when you came you announced You would love me till forever so we ventured out together
<p> All the time that's gone by since you've been mine Has been nothing but amazing and you still drive me crazy When I catch you staring at my smiling softly I come over for a kiss and I know I could die like this
<p> WHEN I WAS YOUNG
<p> Miss Mary Mac Mac Mac All dressed in black black black With silver buttons buttons buttons All down her back back back She asked her mother mother mother For fifty cents cents cents But nowadays that don't buy you nothing
<p> Mm mm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
<p> I'm supposed to be a woman but I still feel like a girl Even though I've grown up tall I feel small in this big world The candles that I'm blowing are adding up as time goes by I used to wish to be a grown up, now I miss the girl inside
<p> Oh those days of playdates in my friend's backyard Sand pit spades, dress ups, potions, monkey bars! Now we're paying off our debt Dealing with our daily stress If I could just forget, I'd go straight back to When I was young
<p> My boyfriend has just left me for a great job overseas I remember Johnny Abbott in Grade Five- he'd never leave Well my rent is overdue and my laundry's piling up I don't want to go to work today it all feels like too much
<p> And when I look at photographs and all that's happened in the past I wish that I could take myself back there And I like Fairybread the best Make believe that I'm a princess And mum and dad will tuck me in And give me a Butterfly Kiss Good night, sleep tight
<p> I NEED TO KNOW (I COULD)
<p> And I know it's my decision to go On my own, on my own And I think, well am I making the right choice? I hope, oh I hope
<p> I am following my dreams Or so it seems, or so it seems But it gets harder as the time draws near For me to leave, for me to leave
<p> I am scared, I am full of doubt But I am getting on the plane and I'm leaving like I knew I always would To follow my heart and it will be hard But I am sure that something's calling me and I need to know I could
<p> I wish that I could stay at home But I can't, no I can't And I'll keep everyone I know In my heart, in my heart
<p> I need to know I tried everything that I ever could have done I need to know for sure, I need to know if there is more Waiting out there for me to come along
<p> EVERYTHING I NEED
<p> Let's go let's go let's get out of here Not tell a soul let's just disappear
<p> What will we take? And where will we go? The best part of all is that I don't know But I have everything I need, if you're with me
<p> Let's play let's play Guessing games while we sing along o the sings we know on the radio At the end of each day We'll sleep in the car underneath the stars and make love slow and close
<p> But where will we go?  And what will we take? Just bring an empty bag for the memories we make I have everything I need, if you're with me
<p> And I wouldn't mind spending everyday until my days are done With you by my side starting from today cause you're the one my love You're the one
<p> I need I need To wake up next to you the truth is I cannot exist without it The way you look at me Tells me I'm exactly where I was always meant to be
