<p> A couple of Nova Scotia businesses are tackling a Stellarton project to promote their foam insulation recycling efforts.
<p> The Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton is getting a new roof, and Truefoam Ltd. of Dartmouth and McCarthy's Roofing of Halifax are collaborating to ensure over five tractor-trailer loads of old foam insulation from the building's roof are diverted from landfills and recycled at Truefoam's plant in Dartmouth.
<p> "The foam insulation on the roof of the museum was actually manufactured here at our plant 30 years ago," Truefoam sales manager David Ball said in an interview Tuesday.
<p> The roof insulation was enclosed and protected from the elements, making it ideal for recycling because it is nice and clean and arriving in a large volume, said Ball.
<p> "It's really just a break-even proposition for us, intended to increase awareness about what the future holds for recycled foam."
<p> Truefoam is spearheading an effort in Nova Scotia to divert expanded polystyrene, popularly known as Styrofoam, away from landfills.
<p> The company manufacturers polystyrene products for the construction and seafood industries and in April announced an investment in recycling equipment and a plan to take the lead in promoting foam recycling.
<p> Ball said several companies, including McCarthy's Roofing, Leon's Furniture , the Halifax architectural firm Solterre Design and some offshore oil companies have joined forces with Truefoam in the effort.
<p> "Polystyrene is ideal for recycling. The challenge is getting the material to a recycling facility like ours because the material is so very bulky and light."
<p> Foam recycling will not become a significant money-making venture until various government levels take steps to keep the material out of landfills.
<p> Until that day arrives, Ball said Truefoam will continue to seek out innovative recycling promotions with the private sector.
<p> "Leon's trucks drop off foam packaging materials at the end of the delivery day at our Dartmouth facility. Better it come to us than to the landfill."
<p> Walmart is a big promoter of Styrofoam recycling, using the recycled product for picture frames, he said.
<p> "We figure we are a bit ahead of the curve, here, as the day will soon arrive when consumers and government will demand Styrofoam be recycled instead of taking up so much space in landfills."
<p> The recycling system recently installed at Truefoam can handle about 180 kilograms of material per hour. The processed polystyrene fetches about 18 cents per pound on overseas markets.
<p> Recovering discarded product and diverting it from landfills is impeded by high transportation costs, which in the case of the Stellarton museum are being shared by Truefoam and McCarthy's Roofing, said Ball.
