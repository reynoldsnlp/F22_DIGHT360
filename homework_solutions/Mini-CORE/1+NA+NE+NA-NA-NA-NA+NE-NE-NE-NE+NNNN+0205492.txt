<p> A retired U.S. Marine whose injuries in Afghanistan have left him partially paralyzed filed a lawsuit claiming that he got a head injury and was soaked in his own urine after being mistreated by personnel at O'Hare International Airport.
<p> Sgt Joseph Smith, a 21-year Army veteran was attacked during his fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2004, leaving him wheelchair-bound for life, according to his wife, Deborah.
<p> Smith, 42, has filed a $300,000 negligence suit against Air Serv Corporation and United Airlines, claiming that an employee of the former carelessly dumped him out of his wheelchair at O'Hare in November 2010 after failing to heed his warning that one of the wheels got stuck.
<p> Grievances: Retired Sgt Joseph Smith, a partially paralyzed former U.S. Marine, is suing an airline and airport workers after claiming that he was mistreated at O'Hare Airport in 2010
<p> Mishandled: Smith was traveling to a shooting completion with a Paralympic team when an Air Serv worker allegedly tossed him from his wheelchair after one of the wheels got stuck
<p> On November 17, 2010, the veteran, who was part of a Paralympic shooting team called Semper Fi, was traveling from Colorado to North Carolina to attend a competition.
<p> Smith was trying to make a connecting flight when he claims an Air Serv worker tasked with helping disabled flyers tossed him out of his wheelchair when one of the front wheels became wedged between the plane and the jetway ramp, leaving Smith dizzy and bleeding from the head, according to the High Point Enterprise .
<p> Smith claims when he boarded the other flight, he was denied an aisle chair used to take handicapped travelers down tight airplanes aisles. Instead, he was forced to drag his 'limp body' to his seat in the seventh row unassisted, which he says caused his catheter bag to burst, soaking him with his own urine.
<p> The Paralympian said he got no help from the cabin crew and ended up sitting in his urine for the duration of the two-hour flight.
<p> High-flying drama: Smith said United Airlines workers refused to give him an aisle chair to take him to his seat, and he had to drag his body down the aisle, which caused his catheter bag to burst
<p> Humiliating: The veteran said he received not assistance from United personnel was was left sitting in his own urine for the entire two-hour flight
<p> 'I had urine all over me, so I tried covering myself up,' Smith recalled. 'People were staring at me -- it was humiliating.'
<p> Smith said he arrived in Colorado Springs with a headache and spent the better part of two days in a hospital where he was diagnosed with a severe concussion.
<p> On his return flight, which also took Smith through O'Hare, the 42-year-old said executives from United, Air Serv and the airport attempted to get him to sign some document, but he refused.
<p> In the years since the incident, the companies in question offered to settle with Smith for $20,000, but he said it was not enough even to cover his hospital bill.
<p> Pressure: Smith said executives from O'Hare, Air Serv and United tried to get him to sign some document and offered a $20,000 settlement, but he refused
<p> United spokesperson Christen David said in an email to the Chicago Sun-Times , 'Our preliminary review does not corroborate Mr Smith's version of events.'
<p> Smith said the lawsuit alleging negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium has to do with dignity, not payoff.
<p> 'I've been in a war, and if (United and Air Serv) want a war, we can go to war,' the 42-year-old veteran said. 'Money is not what this is about. It's about getting things changed for the disabled, because I don't want this to ever happen to anybody else.'

<p> I'm confused. His wheelchair got stuck and the aide threw him out of his chair or the wheelchair got stuck CAUSING him to fall from his chair? Those are two totally different scenerios. Then he had to drag his limp body to the seventh row? Not one person helped a man dragging himself? Where did the wheelchair aide go after he got on the plane, did they just leave? THey had to have known he needed help to his seat. Were the other passengers complaining because smelling urine for 2 hours would make me puke. I need more info on this, I don't doubt mistreatment but it's just so hard to believe that not one person would help this guy.
<p> The poor man. At no time did anyone give him any sort of compassion when he fell out of his chair, and I am more surprised that people on the plane did not see him trying to get to a seat and offer assistance to help get him to his chair. At the end of the day we need to examine our principles. Are we compassionate towards others who need our help? Do we try to show understanding to people and their situations or is it all about you? If you see an old lady struggling with a cane to open a door at a store, help her. Don't walk by her and say, "sucks to be you."
<p> Looking at the red arrows it shows people do not read the whole post as even ones that are agreeing with him have been arrowed. Example" WAAHHH BOO HOO!!! ya big wuss- mootorpaat, PAssi, Estonia, 11/15/12, 3:34 PM Get lost, "PAssi." people read the start but do not notice the post is against the person saying waahhh boo hoo! On the report,it disgusting the way the disabled are treated if they are a vet or not just hope he does not go to the UK as the Government have created a hatred towards the disabled and there is a rise in attacks against the disabled there.
<p> - Buzzymuzzwelle , Vienna, 15/11/2012 17:01 == WROTE=== "Every body has a bad day but this goes way beyond the line. My question is where were the other passengers? Nobody lifted a finger? I say take those guilty up to the 4TH floor at Walter Reed/Bethesda Naval Hospital for a short tour. See what the real world looks like to our Heros, Buzzy" === Buzzy the standard practice is that people on wheelchairs get on board first - there would have been no passengers only flight attendants and any other disabled. The handling of disabled passengers is shared between the airlines and the airport; some are definitely unhelpful and others are extremely supportive. I have been in an aircraft where the other passengers waited for a war wounded veteran to be taken off and applauded... I have also been at an airport where a disabled passenger was left waiting for almost an hour for someone to appear with a wheelchair. The airlines need to take note of these issues.
<p> I am not so sure he was "thrown out " of his wheel chair so much as there was an accident and his wheel chair tipped over. However the airlines do need to give more consideration to the disabled. As a disabled person I had an experience with KLM ( a United partner) where I requested an aisle seat due to my disability and they were completely unhelpful.

<p> Sounds like BS to me. An Air Serv employee "throwing" him to the ground? I have seen these employees at numerous airports & I have NEVER seen one being rough with anyone they were handling. Crawling to his seat while employees ignore him... BS... I have seen flight attendants ask passengers to give applause to military personal boarding the plane. What most likely happened was that the wheelchair wheel got stuck & the attendant did not know & kept pushing & he fell out but highly unlikely that he hit his head, he may have even pulled the handbrake & caused this. Of course he is going to use his disabled vet status to its fullest so he will probably get an out of court settlement. I bet if you spoke to fellow soldiers who worked alongside this guy they will tell you he is full of it. This country is so damn lawsuit happy...its a joke to the rest of the world. - yo_ipitydafool, Phoenix, United States, 11/15/12, 4:31 AM Shouldn't the attendant have enough training to avoid this?
