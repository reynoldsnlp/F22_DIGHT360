<p> A 40-year-old woman and a 61-year-old man were arrested in connection with the incident, which happened at the junction of Narborough Road and Braunstone Gate in Leicester at 9.52am yesterday.
<p> They have since been released on police bail pending further inquiries.
<p> A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said the accident involved a dark BMW and a red Mini Cooper.
<p> Businessman Bob Young, whose CCTV cameras captured the crash, said: 'They were waiting for the lights to change when the BMW hit the Mini and it careered off the road, mounted the kerb and crushed the kiddies.'
<p> The scene of the accident, pictured, shows the two damaged cars which collided, and the pushchair that was carrying one of the killed children, far right
<p> The front of the Mini Cooper, pictured, was severely damaged following the accident at the junction of Braunstone gate and Narborough Road in Leicester. The scene is taped off while officers investigate what happened
<p> Floral tributes and messages have already begun flooding in at the scene where the tragic collision happened.
<p> Builder Dave Marsh, 38, told yesterday how he tried to save the two children after witnessing the crash.
<p> He said: 'We were working on the shop front and the window was out and we heard an almighty smash.
<p> 'We looked out and this BMW had gone into the pedestrian lights where people wait to cross.
<p> 'We could hear this man screaming. I ran over and the first thing I saw was the baby boy on the floor. I shouted "somebody get an ambulance".
<p> 'He was just like a rag doll, he wasn't moving at all. He was lying awkwardly and had been knocked clean out of the pushchair.
<p> 'He was bleeding a lot, he had a nasty crack on his head.
<p> 'Other people had got to the little girl so I stopped with the little boy and held his hand and tried to make him comfortable.
<p> Tributes to the two children, one who died at the scene and another who died later in hospital, have already been left at the scene
<p> Flowers and cards with messages of condolence have been left at the scene following the tragic news of the toddlers' deaths
<p> 'Other people got coats and blankets to put over him to keep him warm.
<p> 'Someone who knew first aid came over and checked him.
<p> 'He was still breathing and I stopped with him until the paramedics arrived.
<p> 'When I got there, the father was sitting on the floor in a dazed shocked state.
<p> 'The mother arrived when all the paramedics were there and she went with them in the ambulance.
<p> 'She has been back with some flowers today with some of the family and the police.
<p> 'It's absolutely tragic really. If they were three steps back then they would have been fine.'
<p> Karzan Nasroullah, who runs a car wash 20 yards from the scene, said he heard a loud bang as he arrived for work.
<p> The accident happened at the junction of Braunstone Gate and Narborough Road in Leicester (pictured)
<p> He added: 'I looked round and saw two men and two little children lying in the road.
<p> 'I was stunned at first, then walked towards the children. It was awful to see. A woman came out of a shop with blankets, then the ambulance and police arrived.'
<p> Another trader, Bob Young, said: 'It's awful what happened. Everyone is very upset. Builders working in a nearby shop ran to help, they didn't hesitate for a moment.
<p> 'They were magnificent. They helped the injured the best they could until the ambulances arrived.'
<p> Police appealed for information to try to find out the exact circumstances of what happened.
<p> Detective Sergeant Mark Watling, of the force's serious collision investigation unit, said: 'If anyone witnessed the incident or the events leading up to it and have not yet spoken to the police we would urge them to contact us.'

<p> +++Does anyone know the church that Mr Baczyk and Mr Tabaka and their partners attend? Maybe we could get a donation fund started for these young people, none of them will be in any condition to support themselves for a while after this tragedy. Would be nice to contribute something to them in their time of need. - Lisa, Athens, 7/8/2012 22:41+++ What a lovely thought Lisa. Just a guess, but if they live locally to the accident it will be the Catholic Church in Leicester. Nice to see a practical comment alongside the messages of good wishes and condolences.
<p> I wonder if a simple concrete bollard instead of those white plastic ones would have helped in this incident and other similar ones. They feel as though they give false security as do metal railings. Pretty sure they used to have concrete posts instead of plastic ones, guess plastics cheaper. - Stanley WIndrush 7/8 14:26 ________________________________________ If you were heading towards a concrete bollard (or child statuette, or 18" high "safety" kerb) what would you instinctively do? And if you were heading towards a toddler on the road, what would you instinctively do? And if you had just instinctively swerved to avoid a toddler, & then instinctively swerved to avoid a concrete bollard (or child statuette, or 18" high "safety" kerb) what would you have instinctively ended up doing?!?! And for that matter if you were driving down one of those ridiculous "safety" kerb flanked one bus wide lanes at a nice safe 20 and a child ran out right in front of you, where would you go?!
<p> Yes, and if more people driving BMW's were following the rules, there would be less accidents. It's hard not to judge people as a group when I see such an astonishing ammount of bad driving on the road being done by this particular brand of car. - Sil, Leicester, 08/8/2012 12:24 What an absolutely ridiculous thing to write. I am a BMW driver and I'll tell you for a fact I'm a safer driver than you. To make such sweeping statements is terribly ignorant and quite honestly inappropriate at this time. This is devastatingly tragic accident but I'm sure it was just an accident. That doesn't justify it because I can't even begin to imagine what these people are going through but I'm pretty sure these people didn't intend to kill 2 little people and will have to live with this for the rest of their lives, without having to deal with ridicilous generalisations from nasty people
<p> You're more likely to cause a crash/collision if you speed. Furthermore, If you are going at 20-30mph in a town, and hit a pedestrian you're not as likely to kill them, as if you were going 50mph in a 20-30mph zone and hit a pedestrian. Lower speeds = better control of your car, more reaction time for you and passenger to avoid collisions. Stop trying to be clever. - John, Liverpool, 08/8/2012 12:20 ________________________________________\\... If you really want to be clever you could look up the facts and find that the speed/reaction time, speed/risk, speed/accident, in fact any related behavioural science/safety science graphs are "U"-shaped not straight lines (except, strangely, those promoted by the road "safety" lobby). And would you like to kneel down in the path of a car doing 20, never mind 30, bend forward, and let it hit you in the head to show us how safe a 20mph collision is?
<p> Oh this is so sad. For the parents of the children & for the father's who witnessed it, I cannot imagine the horror of seeing that happen to your own child. If it was an unavoidable accident, then the driver's too will be affected & also any pedestrians who saw the devastation unfold so quickly. My thoughts go out to the families of the little ones, so so sad.
<p> @John, Liverpool and Dave, UK: I am an engineer who has attended public meetings involving road safety by road safety partnerships, the police, other interested parties and road safety campaigners. These meetings without exception were about road safety partnerships and affiliated campaign groups justifying their existence and promoting anti-car policies using the emotive grief of the unfortunate people that have suffered as a consequence of some accident, to drive their point home - not one constructive road safety issue was actually addressed in terms of engineering. Such is the state of mind of our road safety decision makers, they are now unable it seems to think of road safety in any other terms than the political speed-kill propaganda, yet if people actually do the research and not just spout off the propaganda - speed is responsible for a very small number of accidents yet is a major part of the road safety decision making process - but then such is the power of propaganda.
<p> I am horrified these days at the way people drive. Very few people indicate when pulling out on motorways and they drive too fast and don't pay attention. I have lost count of the niumber of people on mobile phones who wobble across carriageways one handed! Get police back on the roads and pull these killers up. The only reason they do it is because there is nobody to stop them. Madness.
<p> There is no such thing as a safe speed, speed does not kill collisions do, - AndyL, Leeds, 08/8/2012 09:18 I'm not sure what point you are making really? If you hit me at 10mph i will probably still be here to argue with you, if you hit me at 60mph I probably wont. Both are collisions with different consequences - due to speed?
