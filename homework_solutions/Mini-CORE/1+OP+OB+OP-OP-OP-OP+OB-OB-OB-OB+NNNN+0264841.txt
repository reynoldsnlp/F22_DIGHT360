<p> There's a scene in Girls where Lena Dunham 's character Hannah asks to be paid by the publishing house at which she's been interning. Her superior smiles, thanks her, and wishes her well. As Hannah shambles out the door, she takes one last desperate shot, asking why the other young woman sitting before a computer screen was hired as an employee for pay .
<p> Because she knows how to use PhotoShop .
<p> It's a funny-sad moment as is all Girls humor, but according to the L.A. Times , it's more fact that fiction.
<p> Covering the same episode, the Times quotes Richard Nash, former head of the publishing house where Dunham interned as saying, Around 2006-2007, if an intern knew their way around Quark and Photoshop they were gold dust.
<p> You Don't Have To Work For Free
<p> Yesterday, I spoke to a class of law, MBA, and LL.M students at Pepperdine's Straus Institute of Conflict Resolution . Wanting to be genuinely useful rather than just another talking pedant, I asked each student as they entered whether they were prepared to negotiate their first salary. Even if they felt that their first-rate negotiation professor Maureen Weston had taught them well, several had already worked without pay and others were planning to.
<p> You do not have to work for free , I told them.
<p> No one with the need to hire a law or graduate student is unable to pay you, no matter how bad the economy. I believe it's illegal to engage your services without paying you but there is more than one opinion about that. If it's not illegal, it's surely  unethical to be exploiting students and blaming it on the recession.
<p> The students who had worked for free were not giving their time away because their "employers" couldn't afford to pay them. They were working for free because they were too demoralized to ask to be paid.
<p> One student's time was being billed out at the rate of $140 an hour and another worked for a prominent attorney who was well known to be doing very well financially.
<p> I was told by several other students -- who were shocked to be informed they shouldn't be working for free -- that they'd been advised by their law school's career services center to take anything they could get, including unpaid work.
<p> And that's just wrong.
<p> Here, then, are the top three reasons you -- Gen-Y -- should not be working for free.

<p> It's pretty disturbing that companies bill over $100 / hour for intern work. Why can they not share some of the profits? It does not seem fair. I am going to try to avoid internships at all costs, and instead am freelancing to attempt to get the job I want. I still get paid, AND get good experience.
<p> Very good article. Deciding whether or not to take an unpaid internship is one of the first real world tests that college graduates must take. I think that, is where what a person studied, takes effect. A person who studied business is more likely to negotiate payment for their services compared to someone who just studied liberal arts.
<p> I once applied to a job with a lawyer, which ended up being an unpaid internship. He had told me to create a marketing plan for him before he could hire me as an unpaid intern. As I was making it, I realized he needed a lot of marketing work done, which included; website design, content design, and flyer distribution (all of which I was capable of doing.)
<p> I realized he wanted a huge amount of work done, which would have cost him $1,000s if those services were purchased elsewhere, and he wanted me to do it for free. I told him of this and he declined to offer me a salary, so I did not take the job.
<p> You know what, I whole heartedly agree with this article, but how is it going to change anything? It's really easy to say, go on kids, go out there are demand paying jobs! But it's not that easy from our end. Right now, the situation I am in (and many of my friends are in) is this: we graduated, we took the bar, we PASSED the bar, and now we're unemployed. There is only so long that we can sit on our butts doing nothing before it starts to look like a gap on our resumes. So what do we do while looking for a job? Volunteer somewhere, because at least it's doing something. Believe me, I would LOVE to be paid for doing the work I do, but if I quit my volunteer legal position then I just continue to sit around building that gap of time on my resume where I've been doing nothing. It's a great sentiment, but the economy sucks, we need experience, and people just aren't hiring. Please advise.
<p> The post on how to get a paid job post-college and post-grad school in the field you trained for will appear here this week. Too many people who are "not hiring" are "not hiring" because they're hiring interns -- free of charge. Almost all of these concerns CAN pay their interns, particularly lawyers who charge -- at a minimum -- $150/hour for their own time and can charge a new attorney's time out at far more than minimum wage.
<p> Reliable statistics are hard to come by but Yahoo! Business reported in April of this year that "about 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of BAs under 25 in the previous year were jobless or underemployed. Half jobless and and half underemployed so that only 26-27% were unemployed, 26-27% were underemployed and, presumably, the remaining slightly less than 50% were employed in their own field. http://news.yahoo.com/1-2-graduates-jobl\\...
<p> In 2012, law student unemployment/underemployment one year out was 35% with 65% reporting that they were working one year post-graduation in positions for which they had to pass a bar examination. 85% of those law students had jobs. http://chronicle.com/article/Unemploymen\\...
<p> In the worst employment year for college, professional and graduate students, it was still better to have a law degree than to simply have an undergraduate degree. Of course, you have to parse the numbers far more finely to get at the problems of individual students -- particularly those who chose to be liberal arts majors.
<p> Meanwhile, Time reports as follows: While the unemployment rate for recent four year college graduates is 6.8%, according to researchers the unemployment rate for recent high school graduates is nearly 24%. Additionally, nearly 200,000 jobs for workers with at least a Bachelor's degree were added during the recession; 2 million jobs for college-educated workers have been added during the recovery. At the same time, nearly four out of every five jobs destroyed by the recession were held by workers with a high school diploma or less. http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/16/one-\\...
<p> Little comfort, you'll say, to someone more than $100,000 in educational debt before age 30. That's why I'll be posting a column on how to get a paying job as a college, professional or graduate school student later this week.
<p> There are no easy cures, but you CAN increase your chances of getting a better paying job (or simply a PAYING job) by following the negotiation advice I'll be giving later this week.
<p> I'm looking forward to your next article! I graduated with my MA degree in May and I'm still job hunting -- for positions with 100+ applicants. It is really getting frustrating. You are so right about internship position being used by employers instead of entry level paid positions. On the job boards for my field you can see 10 or 12 posts for internship positions before you find 1 paid position looking for a recent graduate. I had time for 1 internship during grad school, but I also needed to work and earn some money while I was going to school. Giving away 20 hours of work for free each week was not something that I could ever do and some of my classmates had full time internships for 10 -- 15 weeks! It is such a bargain for the employer and there are always fresh students to take their place. I would love to see this change.
