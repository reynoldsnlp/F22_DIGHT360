<p> The "81 Group", named after the number of the rebel MPs, are planning "two or three" interventions in Parliament before Christmas, including an attempt to block the approval of EU budget plans.
<p> Last night, a member of the group said: "We want to make sure that the historic rebellion last week was just the start of a wider Eurosceptic movement. We have momentum and we want to tell Downing Street we are alert."
<p> The group will be established as an informal caucus without elected officials, to make it harder for Downing Street aides and ministers to "nobble" members. Senior figures are understood to include Mark Pritchard, the secretary of the 1922 backbench committee, Priti Patel, Stewart Jackson and Peter Bone.
<p> The 81 Group will seek to work with Conservative and Liberal Democrat ministers to improve European policy. For example, Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, is expected to liaise with the group over the new Common Fisheries Policy.
<p> It represents the latest attempt by Conservative MPs to force the Prime Minister into following through on his pledge to repatriate powers from Brussels. Next week another group of Conservative MPs will meet to begin drawing up plans to recast Britain's relationship with the EU.
<p> Last night, Mr Pritchard said: "This [the 81 Group] is not a formal grouping of MPs but an informal caucus of like-minded Euro-sceptics from both the Left and Right of the party, who may choose to co-ordinate in the near future on other important European votes.
<p> "Last week's vote revealed a willingness and desire by the majority of backbenchers to put their country first. Our meetings will be open to those who abstained and voted against the EU motion who have since felt they could have voted in a different way."
<p> The establishment of the group is likely to dismay the Prime Minister, who was hoping to move on from last week's unprecedented Conservative rebellion.
<p> Last week it emerged that Whitehall officials are reviewing every major government department's relationship with the EU to identify areas where powers can be brought back from Brussels.
<p> However, the issue has sparked a Cabinet rift, with Mr Clegg warning Tory backbenchers that there was "no question" of Britain "unilaterally" seizing back control of laws from Europe.
<p> Yesterday in the Commons, George Osborne faced a Conservative backlash against the Government's position.
<p> Julian Lewis, a Conservative MP who voted against the Government's whip on an EU referendum, accused the Chancellor of advocating a policy "undermining the system of democratic states in Europe which gave the continent peace for over half a century". Mr Osborne insisted the Government had shown it could "extract important concessions", for example by taking Britain out of the euro bail-out mechanism.
