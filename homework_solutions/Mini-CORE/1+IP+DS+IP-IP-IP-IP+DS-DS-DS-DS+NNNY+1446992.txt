<h> Christmas Gift Ideas for Women
<p> Date: 22/11/12
<p> Rating:
<p> Advantages: it doesn't need to be expensive
<p> Disadvantages: some ladies are too picky!
<p> Christmas is my favourite time of the year and I absolutely love shopping for presents for the ladies/girls in my family. Sometimes it can be difficult to come up with new ideas for presents and I admit that year after year, some family members receive the same thing from me. I am happy to keep buying as long as I know for certain that it is something that they will like.
<p> ~Perfume~
<p> Perfume, in my opinion, is tricky to buy for someone else. It is all good and well knowing that your sister or niece likes sweet or floral perfumes but actually choosing one is difficult and if they don't like it then it may be a total waste. I personally love receiving perfume as a gift and have been rarely disappointed by any purchases I have been given.
<p> At this time of year, Boots have lots of lovely gift sets on offer and these normally include a shower gel or body lotion as an additional extra item at no extra cost. This year I had to source a nice perfume for my Mum as a gift from Dad and swayed away from her usual Boss Femme and Miss Dior in favour of the new YSL perfume called Manifesto. I have bought my MIL Eternity Moment and my best friend Britney Midnight Fantasy,
<p> Perfume can be a lovely gift if chosen will and I recommend looking for Boots advantage card offers to earn something back too. Samples are often on offer as well as tester bottles.
<p> ~Essentials~
<p> Personally I feel you can never go wrong with pyjamas, festive or cosy socks, slippers and housecoats. I was quite disappointed last year that no one had bought me new pyjamas for Christmas (its a little tradition really). The George department in Asda, Matalan and New Look offer a lovely range of pyjamas at affordable prices. I've recently bought some lovely festive socks and slippers from Matalan at really cheap prices and they make lovely 'extra' gifts in my opinion. I have bought my Mum a new cosy housecoat and some pyjamas for my sister.
<p> ~Candles~
<p> If a girl you know is in to Yankee Candles then selecting some wax tarts or votives and popping them in a tissue filled box would make a lovely treat. I know I would appreciate something like this. It is relatively inexpensive if you buy a small bulk lot of tarts.
<p> ~A Beauty Box or Basket~
<p> I normally make up a box of my Mums favourite beauty products at Christmas time. I usually buy when stores such as Boots and Wilkos have their reductions on. This year my Mum is being treated to Ialongside her other presents) Radox bubble bath, a face mask, a Sanctuary body lotion, No7 wipes and a few other treats. It is a little more personal than a standard gift set from Boots (though they are great pressies too IMO).
<p> ~Hamper~
<p> What do you buy the 93year old Granny who has everything? Well for the past two years I have sourced a big Christmas box and filled it with her favourite things. My Gran loves her food so the usual selections include oat cakes, fancy marmalade, shortbread, tablet and also non foody items including Dove handwash. I place shredded paper in the box and put a bow on top - looks lovely and lots of thought. My Gran loves it and I feel this is a nice gift for older ladies.
<p> ~Conclusion~
<p> Above are just a few of my ideas. If I think of anymore I will add them as I go along. Buying for ladies doesn't have to be ovely expensive.One year when we were more skint than normal, I bulk bought some Body Shop mini shower gels, some organza and ordered Scottish tablet. I made up little sets for some of the ladies in my family (step MIL, aunties etc) and they went down a treat. Most are happy with something which is nicely presented and there are often great offers on in the shops in the run of to Christmas.
