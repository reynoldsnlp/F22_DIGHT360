<h> Baby Baby, All The Time Lyrics - Nat King Cole
<p> Once I had a gal, As sweet as she could be. Once I had a gal, And she was right for me. Kinda sandy hair, Eyes so soft and blue That you couldn't help but care When she looked at you. She called me "baby"... "Baby", all the time.
<p> She said, "Baby, can't you see? "Baby, understand "Baby, you're for me, Won't you take my hand?" But I pushed her away, Wouldn't let her near Pushed her far away Now I'm wishing I could hear her Call me "Baby"... "Baby", all the time.
<p> ~interlude~
<p> It's so lonely through the day, Lonely through the night, Lonely, lonely hours Without that gal I held so tight. Lord, I pray that You Will listen to my plea. Keep her close to You So she'll come back to me, And call me "Baby"... "Baby", all the time.
<p> Baby... Baby, all the time.
