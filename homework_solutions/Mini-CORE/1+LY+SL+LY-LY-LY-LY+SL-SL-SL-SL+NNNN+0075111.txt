<h> As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone lyrics
<h> Loretta Lynn As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone lyrics
<p> Hello (Hello Loretta) Darlin' I knew it was you (Loretta there's something I just got to tell you) Oh, please tell me what to do (I don't really know how to say this but I want to tell you that I) You gave me the will to go on As soon as I picked up the phone (No, no, you don't understand Loretta I'm trying to tell you that I)
<p> The talk is around that we're through (Yeah, I know I've heard it too) Oh, darling, tell me what to do (But that's just it, that's what I'm trying to tell you I wanna tell you that) I knew you'd tell me they were wrong As soon as I picked up the phone (Oh, but it is true, they're not wrong) [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/loret\\... ] Oh, no (I'm sorry Loretta) Oh, no, I can't believe that it's true (I'm sorry Loretta, I'm really, really sorry) Oh, no, oh, no, I can't believe that we're through (I know you know that I, I never thought it would come to this)
<p> You tell me it's over and done (I really thought that I loved you and you know that) You say that you've had all your fun (You've just got to believe me that I never meant to hurt you) But I can't believe you've been gone (This is the hardest thing that I've ever had to do and it hurts me too) As soon as I hang up the phone (Yeah, I'll be gone) As soon as I hang up the phone (Goodbye Loretta)
