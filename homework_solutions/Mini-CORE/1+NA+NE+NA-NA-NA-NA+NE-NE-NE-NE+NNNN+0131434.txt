<p> Former South Carolina Governor and Fox News contributor Mark Sanford wandered off the Appalachian Trail again Sunday morning when, in yet another completely isolated example of a Republican being totally-not-racist even though he sounds racist, said that President Obama is going to "come out and throw a lot of spears" at Tuesday's upcoming debate.
<p> America's News HQ anchor Shannon Bream wasn't in the shot, but she didn't react audibly, and never skipped a beat in continuing to discuss expectations for Tuesday's debate.
<p> Gov. Sanford first praised former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney 's performance at the first debate , then predicted that "You know, obviously Obama will come out in this case much more forcefully and he will throw a lot of spears."
<p> Completely coincidentally, and not at all related to this, the term "spearchucker" is a racial slur against black people, but what would a 52 year-old white guy from South Carolina know about that? Also, he didn't call President Obama a "spearchucker," he just said he would be throwing spears. That's completely different
<p> Bream ignored Sanford's declaration, instead guiding the discussion around to a sort of warning about President Obama being "too aggressive" at the next debate. "We got mixed signals from the Obama campaign that the President intends to be more aggressive this time around," she said. "We know it's a town hall format where the candidate will be taking questions from undecided voters, but also with a moderator in place. How well does that play in an audience, and with real live average citizen voters? I mean, there has to be a balance in the tone, I would imagine, for how aggressive you can be in that kind of setting."
<p> Tommy must lie awake at night thinking up new racial code words to add to his database.

<p> New? Why not just say he's eating the watermelon of our middle class. When has "throw a lot of spears" ever, ever been used as an expression other than by racists?

<p> Democrats and liberals are sensitive, overly sensitive in my estimation, when it comes to racial coding just because the Republican Party has used it for so long, they assume they always will.
<p> That being said, this sounds like an SNL sketch. The absolute best way I can spin this as something other than obvious subconscious Southern racial messaging ( the expression just came to mind ), is that he cynically wants to get people on the left who care about race relations upset so they can be vilified a al Coulter, or he was dared by a frat house.

<p> what has to be done is look at Sanford's rhetoric which I don't feel like doing. If' it's a phrase he often uses with respect to any politician, then I wouldn't be too sensitive to racism charges

<p> You make a valid point. But would tell any other victim of systemic societal abuse and oppression (say Jews regarding the Holocaust) of being overly sensitive to "coded," dog whistle, rhetoric? Slavery ended more 100 years ago. Jim Crow in our lifetime. Spearchukcers was -- and is -- a common insult in the South. Not even coded as rightfully you suggest.

<p> It's such obvious language, the idea that it just happened seems silly. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but he's Southern, I'm Southern, the idea that you an say that and not recognize the amazingly obvious and more common meaning is ridiculous.

<p> Michele Gardner
<p> Gotcha Sandford!!!! You're going down harder than Michael Richards for this one!!! hahaha TC is too much. I think the anchor brought up a good point about aggressiveness. Since this is a town hall format it's extremely difficult to go after your opponent. It's a time to talk directly to the American people. This is ironic given that Obama's strategy during the first debate was to talk directly to the American people (which can be measured by how many times Obama looked directly into the camera in the first debate) . However, the Obama campaign had it backwards!!!! They should have been aggressive during the first debate and talked "directly" to the American people during this one (which lends itself to this format anyways). Now, they somehow have to accommodate a missed opportunity into this new format. I guess only time will tell.

<p> I don't think I really disagree. The idea that he doesn't recognize how stupid and racially-loaded that expression is (and this is discounting the ongoing accusations of racial coding, sometimes more discrete, non-existent, or blatant) I think it absurd. But that doesn't mean he doesn't like black people. That's the line I think that should be drawn.

<p> He does it because that's all he has. As Obama himself said,
<p> "If you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters," he proclaimed, "If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from."

<p> I agree with the beginning of that. How would one know?
<p> Rhetoric is one way, behavior is another. Black communities have done proportionately worse than any other demographic under the President's recovery. In fact, the rich have done far and away the best.
<p> Want to call the president a racist?
<p> I think stupid language is stupid and should be called out for it. If he simply acknowledges (provided his even ever comes up again) that is was a poor expression and he meant nothing by it, I think that's fine.
<p> Micheal Scott says stuff like this all the time (comparing disgraced Governor Sanford to a fictional character is my way of being generous). Stupidity isn't malice, and I think it takes malice for anything to complain about.
<p> I think the same about Governor Romney's embarrassing "Who let the dog's out... bling bling..." nonsense. Not the kind of racism I think we need to worry about. Certain white people will always be uncomfortable.

<p> This let's those racist apologists claim all accusations are groundless which only helps racism thrive in their party. Someone needs to stop. Either the left needs to stop the soapboxing demagoguery of blanket accusations of racism and focus only on the truly stupid (I think this is an example) and the ugly racist (and tell them apart ), or the right needs to stop pretending they don't have and foster a thriving wellspring of racial resentment that bleeds into their national dialog.

He was a fake, insincere, pretend good-old-country boy, just as he was in politics, but not overtly racist. Terribly disappointing and a further soiling of what shreds remain of his reputation.

<p> I guess my only concern is where that line is. What's the threshold between ignorance and hate? What was the intention and was it to dismiss or denigrate or simple dog whistle. After all, you can kick a hornet's nest without being a hornet yourself.
<p> Some Republicans, I think mistakenly, are against gay marriage and gay issues, but do so out of blind acquiescence and misplaced loyalties or actual animosity. And there are those without animosity whose "hearts are in the right place" because they actually think they're helping by denigrating homosexuality to something akin to an illness.
<p> Some people thought the Islamic Community Center in New York was insensitive out of uninformed concern for fellow Americans, some of them were religiously intolerant.
<p> The problems with calling out anyone who says something like this as a racist is that it can then be used against people who clearly aren't like Vice President Biden and President Clinton and that the lack of discernment is the very same issue at hand with actual racists who lump individuals into wholes.
<p> There are some clearly, self-avowed racists here. Just wait for any article on race (or any close proximity to race) and you'll see them crawl out into the safety of the internet. But that doesn't mean people (like myself) who don't fully agree with Affirmative Action as it stands or made a crude observation as President Clinton had, are racists but the problem, in my mind, is that we get lumped in.
<p> Oh! And quite often, I think, the left goes nuts decrying illusory racism because their accurate calls fall on deaf ears. I think Don Imus is a loser and an idiot. I think Speaker Gingrich is derisive of everyone, especially the poor. I think he wants votes from underprivileged whites.
<p> Ann Coulter, just last Friday on Real Time, said "racism is dead... liberals are racists." You know, McCarthy was right. There were communists and socialists, but you're credibility evaporates when you assume everyone in this group, everyone who says x and y, etc fall into that category.

<p> This latest "spear throwing" comment by this adulterer GOP rep. is one of many attacks on Obama's racial background to solidify their low info voter base. I'm not going to list them all but suffice to note that this election will set a record for the number of African Americans and Latino votes that will be going to the DEMS ticket and this is one of many reasons why.
<p> One concern I do have about all of this is the extremely pervasive tactic of papering over intentional racism with "plausible deniability". That's what makes "dog-whistling" so difficult to address. Another similar tactic is "passive aggressive racism" like I've often heard from the stormfront trolls -- they will often not make overtly racist statements, and even avoid dog-whistling -- instead preferring to claim white people as a special class of victim. An extremely popular phrase from them is "Anti-Racist is code word for Anti-white". If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that *precise* phrase (word for word) I could buy the moon.
<p> That stuff is troublesome to address, and I wonder if tiptoeing around it in order to avoid ascribing harmful intent to it doesn't actually play into their hands. In situations like this I often find myself wishing for the days when people would burn crosses and scream ni**er. At least they were up front. Lee Atwater is laughing from beyond the grave.

<p> You are really kind, and that's a great clip. I'm not used to original or insightful perspectives from youtube personalities. I suppose I should be more open-minded.
<p> I share your concerns about "plausible deniability," but sometimes the guilty go free to protect the innocent. And I think more than protect them, it protects the dignity of the system itself. I'm comfortable with disgraced Governor Sanford being asked about his word choice and see from there. If he does acknowledge it but denies what it means, it really is unfair to assume he dislikes black people.
<p> There are plenty of other, I think perfectly reasonable and plausible, scenarios that don't ironically play into stereotypes of a white, Republican Southerner. It really could have been an innocuous metaphor. It has racial connotations, but there is a legitimate fear of restricting language for the sake of not offending anyone.

<p> Welcome to pains of being a public figure -- particularly a politician (even if former) -- making a public statement. Where was his staff, his script? Maybe he's just not particularly good at what he does. Hopefully, he'll think twice before wilfully letting the next TV crew point a camera and mic his way, but I doubt it. Nothing I've seen from the man thus far suggests that he has any common sense whatsoever.

<p> You should do some reading and investigation then. Libertarianism comes out of the tradition of classical liberalism. In fact, many people consider libertarianism to be synonymous with classical liberalism.
<p> "Libertarianism is often thought of as "right-wing" doctrine. This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social -- rather than economic -- issues, libertarianism tends to be "left-wing". It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, extra-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service."
