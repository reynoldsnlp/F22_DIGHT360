<p> Guns aren't the cause of death, people are. Do a little research on Venezuela. The murder rate is 8 times higher than the U.S. and they strictly enforce gun control. That's right, they just run around chopping people's heads off with machetes instead.

<p> It makes little sense that Myers would have a gun loaded with 'dummy rounds'. Why would he? Where would they come from? Not training, where ammunition, even blanks, are controlled. And why buy such rounds for your personal weapon?

<p> Yes, this act was foolish and drunken. And there can be no sensible excuse. But I would imagine, based off the suspect's photo that he knows how wrongful his actions were.
