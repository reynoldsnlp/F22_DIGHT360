<p> On the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is making music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again
<p> On the road again Goin' places that I've never been Seein' things that I may never see again And I can't wait to get on the road again
<p> On the road again Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway We're the best of friends Insisting that the world keep turning our way and our way
<p> Is on the road again [ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/w/willie-nel\\... ] I just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is making music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again
<p> On the road again Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway We're the best of friends Insisting that the world keep turning our way and our way
<p> Is on the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is making music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again And I can't wait to get on the road again
