<p> ?NEW! - LUCHADORAS by Peggy Adam (Blank Slate):  Expressively drawn in a bold, inky style, this is a  powerful but tender portrayal of life in Juarez, Mexico, where feminicidos , the abduction and murder of young girls and women, number in the hundreds.

<p> Whirlwind Wonderland follows the life-altering exploits of a somewhat-normal Filipino American girl as she meanders through sleepy suburban sprawls, empty diners, fantasy-filled commuter traffic jams, misplaced football fanaticism, ethnic identity crash courses, and just good ole family hi-jinx.

<p> ALABASTER is a Brooklyn (?) artist I know nothing about, except her (his?) comics are so lovely.
<p> ?NEW! - THE COMPLETE TALAMAROO by Alabaster (Hic and Hoc):  Talamaroo is a cute little, innocent creature adrift in a curious world.  A naughty bird is her troublesome guide through these four tales: "Hungry," where Talamaroo confronts the ethics of eating, "Dizzy," where a mushroom dinner blows her mind, "Lonely," a tale of love, and "Envy," where trouble rears its ugly head.  Delightfully and airily drawn, these simple stories ask deep questions and do so with lightness, humor, and charm.  Highly recommended!  56 digest pages, b+w interiors wrapped in an impossibly gorgeous hand-silkscreened sleeve.  This is a remarkably lovely object.  $15.00.

<p> EDD BALDRY et al. On our recent West Coast tour, Noah and I kept running into this gang of crazy UK zinesters who were also on tour, following us (or were we following THEM?!?!) around the country. We met up with them in Minneapolis, Portland, San Francisco, and finally, back in Denver! Edd was their charming anarchist spokesperson, and I picked up several interesting UK comic-zines from him...
<p> THE WALL #1 by Edd Baldry. In this wordless Wind in the Willows inspired allegory, Rat and Mole wake up one morning to find their homes walled-in and sharpshooters waiting outside to pick them off. Together they plan an escape into the Wild Wood. The story is arresting and the art is cartoony and nice. 6.25" x 6.25"; 36 pages with two-color covers; $5.00.
<p> JOSH BAYER is a wild genius of cartooning.  His scratchy and gestural comics reveal a complexity and subtlety that mightn't be noticed at first glance.  Funny, angry and smart, we could use more comix like these!
<p> RAW POWER (Retrofit King-Sized Annual):  This full-on comic of raw abandon features a crazy super-hero vigilante, The Cat, in a plot by Jimmy Carter and G. Gordon Liddy to stop the nascent punk movement of the late seventies.  Bayer skillfully renders an alternate reality of violence, depravity, and government corruption with humor and unfettered energy.  Highly recommended.  32 full-size pages, color covers, b+w interior; $6.50.
<p> ?NEW! - GORILLA YEAR #1 by Cara Bean:  Cartoonist Bean presents the first in a series of Gorilla-related comics-- a dreamlike story of personal discovery featuring plenty of gorillas, natch, but also some cats, dogs, and squirrels.

<p> JIMMY BEAULIEU is a stalwart Montral cartoonist and publisher.  He has published dozens of comics and books, both of his own and for others, under his various imprints (currently, Colosse ).
<p> SUDDENLY SOMETHING HAPPENED by Jimmy Beaulieu (Conundrum).  "Jimmy Beaulieu is the founder of the publishing house Mcanique gnrale and the author of eight books in French. Suddenly Something Happened is his first book in English and collects the storylines from Quelques Pelures and Le Moral des Troupes (which won the 2005 Prix de l'Espoir Qubcois), as well as many new pages, to form the definitive edition of this autobiographical work. Jimmy ponders the difference between living in Quebec City and Montreal with its bohemian nightlife. He starts to publish other artists, travels to comic festivals around the globe, settles down and watches the neighbourhood change. Told in richly rendered pencil lines in front of masterfully drawn backdrops portraying Quebec's urban and rural landscapes, these are the complete non-adventures of Jimmy Beaulieu, an easygoing artist with an appreciation for the finer things in life -- such as the balconies of Montreal in spring time and station wagons with fake wood paneling."  7x9 inches, 256 pgs; $20.00.
<p> GABRIELLE BELL is one of my favorite contemporary cartoonists. Her quietly detached views of modern life are sweet and smart. I can't recommend highly enough her recent book collections from Drawn & Quarterly... meanwhile, we have this small-press release in stock:
<p> L.A. DIARY is a collection of Gabrielle Bell's acclaimed autobiographical comics published in conjunction with the Minneapolis Rain Taxi Festival. In a rare glimpse behind Gabrielle's creative process, the book also contains several strips taken directly from her real comics diary. 20 pages with two-color covers, and an introduction by cartoonist/publisher Tom K. $4.00
<p> ?NEW! - JULY DIARY by Gabrielle Bell (Uncivilized):  A comic a day from July 2011, by Gabrielle Bell, the best cartoonist in the biz:  Disorienting Day, Flyer, Old Diaries, Lost Keys lead the reader into discovering the remarkable within the everyday.  I don't know what to say, this stuff is tops, and couldn't come more highly recommended!  With bonus features in the back.  44 pages, 5.5" x 7", perfect-bound paperback;  b+w interiors.  $6.00 well spent.
<p> ?NEW! - THE VOYEURS by Gabrielle Bell (Uncivilized Books): The Voyeurs is a real-time memoir of a turbulent five years in the life of renowned cartoonist, diarist and filmmaker Gabrielle Bell. It collects episodes from her award-winning series, Lucky , in which she travels to Tokyo, Paris, the South of France and all over the United States, but remains anchored by her beloved Brooklyn, where sidekick Tony provides ongoing insight, offbeat humor, and enduring friendship. 160 pages in full-color throughout, hardcover, 6" x 9";  $25.00.
<p> MARC BELL is one of my favorite cartoonists of all time.  His loopy, giddy comics are populated with some of the strangest and most lovable characters you'll ever meet.  Absurd, with a delicious sense of wit and an openhearted gentleness, these are the kind of comics you read over and over, and savor every time.
<p> MOJO ACTION COMPANION UNIT #1 by Marc Bell (Exclaim! Comics):  Whoa!  When this title first came out, in the mid-90's, and I picked it up for the catalog, I felt like I was in the big leagues.  Things were changing.  Black Eye was publishing Tom Hart's The Sands , Exclaim was publishing Marc Bell, and Tom Devlin's Highwater Books was just around the corner.  So it was with great delight that Marc let me know he still had a few boxes of these lying around! MACU contains tons of crazy cool old comix, including early Shrimpy and Paul, the classics "Oh Happy Day" and "Stupid Goddamn Shitty Day," Where Is The Love, and much more.  32 comic-sized pages, full color cover, guts on good old newsprint;  $4.00.
<p> NOG A DOD: Prehistoric Canadian Psychedooolia edited by Marc Bell.  As Marc writes in his introduction, " Nog a Dod is the filtering down of material that originally appeared in self-published booklets created by a loosely affiliated group of Canadian artists between approximately 1995 and 2005."  These artists were at the forefront of what was briefly known as "Doodle-Art," but that appellation doesn't do justice to the genius and variety of detourned photos, collage, zine art, painting, drawings and collaborations collected here.  This beautifully printed book from Conundrum gathers the cream of that crop, with extra notes and historical information provided by editor Bell.  Artists include:  Jason McLean, Peter Thompson, Marc Bell, Owen Plummer, Mark Connery, Maura Doyle, Julie Voyce, Tara Azzopardi, Amy Lockhart, Robert Dayton, Keith Jones, and many more.  This is a must have for people interested in the history of zines, comix, and/or underground art.  288 whopping pages (96 is full color!), 6.25" x 8"; $25.00.
<p> Above: Various pages from Nog a Dod
<p> SHRIMPY AND PAUL AND FRIENDS is Marc's first, classic, collection, from Highwater Books way back in the day.  I've managed to snag a bunch for you.  This book belongs on the shelf of anyone who loves cartooning.  212 6" x 9" pages, b+w with spot colors and full color segments;  $17.00.
<p> MIKE BERTINO's Trigger is a "one-man-anthology," published by Revival House.  Well written and nicely drawn, it runs the gamut from quiet fiction to out-of-control raunch.  I have the first two issues in stock:
<p> ?NEW! -- TRIGGER #1 by Mike Bertino:  Features the stories "Grown-ups Part One," about a young, idealistic high school teacher as he navigates his new world of academic politics and intrigue; "Flannels Are Cool Again," a ridiculous barroom tale of bathroom sex, ex-lax cookies, and losers; and "Below Us," a harrowing short story about hallucinating.   28 pages, color covers/b+w interiors, 6" x 8"; $5.00.
<p> CLARA BESSIJELLE is a young Swedish cartoonist, whose work in graphite is intricate, mysterious, and dreamlike.  We have ner new Domino Book Faceman in stock...
<p> ?NEW! - FACEMAN by Clara Bessijelle (Domino Books):  This fantastic new release is a great introduction to Bessijelle's work:  Dark and ominous, yet playful, and rendered in detailed graphite, Faceman is a weird and warped tour de force, returning one to the heady cultural days of the Weimar.  Highly recommended. " A theater critic attends an incomprehensible play. Forced to write about the it, he finds he can't remember a single detail. He attempts to ask the box office clerk to summarize the plot but instead she misunderstands him and the critic finds himself forced to view the performance a second time. While sitting in the theater, a man begins to follow him, always one step away. Slowly  the critic becomes entangled with events that will force him to question his 'identity'---a problem that sets him onto a collision course with the powerful Identity Group." 24 pages, 8" x 10"; color cover, b+w interior;  $5.00.
<p> BLACK AND RED is a radical book publisher out of Detroit.  Their Reproduction of Daily Life was the book that prompted me to quit my factory job in 1992 and start Spit and a Half.  They also publish a good amount of Situationist literature, of which I carry a few below.
<p> ?NEW! - ON THE POVERTY OF STUDENT LIFE: Classic Situationist tract, written in 1966, addressing the complacency and co-optation of the college-age youth of the time, but still applicable to all of us: "In modern capitalism, reification becomes a spectacle where everyone is assigned a specific role within the collective passivity.  The student is no exception to this role.  His is a temporary role, a rehearsal for his proper role when he will serve actively to preserve the commodity system.  Being a student is just an initiation." Not as dense as Society of the Spectacle , but loaded with zingers.  36 digest pages, all text, with notes.  $3.00
<p> ?NEW! -- THE REPRODUCTION OF DAILY LIFE by Fredy Perlman. "What sustains Capitalism?  Our acceptance of everyday activities.  The text offers a clear introduction to basic Marxist concepts like commodity fetishism, and surplus value;  it also traces the transformation of human activity into capital." Reading this pamphlet when I was 23 years old and driving a forklift was one of the most powerful moments in my life, and led directly to me starting this distro.  24 digest pages, NOT COMICS; only $2.00.
<p> ?NEW! -- SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE by Guy Debord.  One of the seminal texts of the Situationist International, from one of its founding members, Society of the Spectacle is a penetrating critique of modern Western society.  In it, Debord lays out his case that we've been turned into suckers, passively viewing the antics of politicians and celebrities instead of living our own lives.  This is the original English translation of this 1967 text, which, sadly, only grows more relevant over time.  120 pages of dense French philosophy and lightning-like insights.  NOT COMICS;  $6.00.
<p> THE BLOBBY BOYS by Alex Schubert.  Wait, who is this guy?  He's from Kansas City?  I love Kansas City! Blobby Boys is Schubert's perfectly-formed and withering look at hipsterism, drawn in a deadpan, modern style with eye-blazing color.  Destined to be a classic.  Before you balk at the price, I heard through the grapevine that these things cost him six bucks each to make.  Help a brother out, won't you?  16 digest pages, full color on glossy paper; $7.00.
<p> MELINDA BOYCE I met Melinda at the 2010 Portland Zine Symposium, and wow-- her comics blew me away! She has a really distinctive voice, and a riveting color gouache style that is scrumptious to look at. One of my favorite discoveries in years, these comics are completely awesome!
<p> AOA #1 - Wonderful collection of Melinda's daily diary comics, covering March-August of 2009, all in gorgeous full color! If you are into autobio stuff, you will NOT be disappointed, these are some of the best comics to come down the pike in awhile! 5.5" x 6"; 180 full color perfect-bound pages with color covers; $18.00.
<p> OKAY? OKAY! by Melinda Boyce and Aaron Whitaker. This beautiful book tells a love story from two different perspectives. The rules were they each wrote out the story of their romance independently, as honest as possible, and neither one got to see the other's story until they both were done. The result is one of the best comics I've read in ages. Both Melinda and Aaron's artwork is excellent, and the story is engrossing, funny, and down to earth. Highly recommended! 5.25" x 8.5"; 64 b+w pages, full color covers; only $5.00. OUT OF STOCK
<p> Melinda's art (above)

<p> JOHN BRODOWSKI's comic Curio Cabinet features pop culture tropes run through the surrealist wringer.  Drawn in a milky, smeared style, with graphite, and, lately, woozy digital effects, his comics are one of a kind tales of violence and transcendence.
<p> CURIO CABINET COLLECTION by John Brodowski (Secret Acres):  Weird-ass and lovely comics with a crooked-eye towards heavy metal, horror movies and D&D, these exquisite pencil-rendered stories evoke the contemporary surrealism of John Hankiewicz, but have an absurdity and focus all their own.  144 pages, color cover, $15.00.
<p> BOX BROWN is the mastermind behind Retrofit Comics and an accomplished cartoonist in his own right.
<p> ?NEW! - MINI-KUS #6:  "Killman" by Box Brown:  In this epic space drama full of cosmic fisticuffs, Killman is trying to destroy all the gods while maneuvering between friends and foes alike.  28 mini-pages, full color throughout;  $5.00.
<p> ?NEW! - FUCK SHITS by Box Brown (Retrofit):  Two stories about the teenage condition.  In the first, weirdo loser Travis spies some girls drawing in the woods and his life is changed;  in the second, Spolski and his friends get high at the playground with transformative results.  Thoroughly solid cartooning, and plenty of detail to the writing make these comics, funny, believable, and warm.  36 digest sized pages, two-color covers, b+w interiors;  $5.00.
<p> ?NEW! - THE SURVIVALIST by Box Brown (Blank Slate):  The latest release from Blank Slate's Ignatz-like Chalk Marks series features a book-length comic from Box Brown about apocalyptic loser Noah Wartowsky, who ignores his co-worker's sniggers and plans to ride out the end of the world in his underground bunker.  When the world actually does end, he meets a snarky woman and her cat, and finds himself a changing man.  48 pages, two-color cover and b+w interiors, approx. 8.25" x 11.25";  $8.00.
<p> NATHAN BULMER is that Eat More Bikes guy.  He 's Canadian lives in Brooklyn.  His comics are funny.
<p> LILLI CARR has been self-releasing beautiful little comics for some time now, as well as having her work published by companies like Fantagraphics and Top Shelf.   Everything she does is worth looking into-- have you seen her beautiful animations?  I carry the following titles:
<p> THE LAGOON (Fantagraphics):  A family is seduced by a mysterious creature's siren song that can be heard emanating from the lagoon after dark in Lilli Carr's first long-form work, and how each member reacts to the song in The Lagoon is the crux of the story. For the wise -- or pixilated -- Grandpa, the song reminds him that, in the time he has left, he must pause to respect, appreciate, and fear nature. The song hints at something that Zoey, the daughter, is too young to fully grasp. And the song lures the sexually frustrated mother, and eventually, her husband, into danger... 80 pages, B+W, 7.5" x 9", hardcover with lovely full color cover; $15.00.
<p> NINE WAYS TO DISAPPEAR (Little Otsu): The charmingly peculiar short stories collected in Nine Ways to Disappear revolve loosely around the theme of disappearance and mark a new form for Lilli Carr. Skillfully drawn single panels explore a rich imagined world where actions have unexpected consequences and loneliness pervades, but not without a sense of the absurd. Each story unfolds quickly and features characters that run the gamut: joke-writing sisters gone awry, a wandering sleepwalker, a pearl with curious properties, an elusive coughing neighbor, a wide-eyed girl of questionable appeal, even a storm drain. Whether animate or inanimate, sweet or monstrous, Lilli has the ability to infuse them all with pathos, humanity, and humor. 192 pages, blue ink; 5" x 5.25"; $13.00.
<p> ?NEW! -- TALES OF WOODSMAN PETE by Lilli Carr (Top Shelf). Tales of Woodsman Pete is a collection of vignettes and stories about a solitary albeit gregarious woodsman with a loose grasp on his own personal history and that of the outside world. He forms relationships with his inanimate surroundings and muses to a dead audience, specifically his bear rug, Philippe. His own tales eventually become entangled with that of the legendary Paul Bunyan, and the two become indirectly intertwined, illuminating the discrepancy between the character of the storyteller and the character within his stories. 80 pages, $7.00.
<p> LISA CARVER has been one of the anchors of the American underground scene for decades.  Her performance art as a member of SUCKDOG is legendary, and her 90's zine Rollerderby has long stood as one of the high points of that decade's small press movement.  In her new self-published book, "________________", Lisa tells a powerful, personal story of childhood sexual abuse.
<p> ?NEW! -- "________________" by Lisa Carver.  This book hurt my heart, and opened my eyes to a world I barely knew existed.  A few years back, Lisa began painting, not to make pretty pictures, but to explore her subconscious, and what she found there was devastating-- memories of systemized sexual abuse at the hands of her father, who forced her into prostitution at the age of four.  Lisa's story is presented in brutally honest prose, alongside the paintings themselves, and she concludes with a withering attack on the institutions that allow such abuse to go unnoticed and unpunished.  This is not a fun book to read, but I think it's a necessary one.  Read a recent interview with Lisa about the book here .  84 full color pages, 8.5" x 11"; $20.00.
<p> ?NEW! - ROLLERDERBY: THE BOOK by Lisa Carver, et al.  In the 1990's, Lisa's zine Rollerderby stood head and shoulders above the pack.  Its strengths laid not only in her own crazy, brilliant writing and attitude, but in her ability to draw the best, and most outrageous, from her stellar array of contributors, including Dame Darcy, Boyd Rice, Jaina Bee, Vaginal Davis, Cindy Dall, and many more.  This book collects the best of the first sixteen issues, and features blow job tips, weird neighbors, and all the rest.  This wild ride through Lisa's world is as fun today as it was when first published, and also serves as an indispensable document of zine history.  200 pages, 8.5" x 11";  $15.00.
<p> CATHON is an artist I know nothing about at all.  Except his/her comics are fun to look at and he/she can draw the hell out of raccoons.
<p> CLUTCH McBASTARD's long-running diary comic (it's in its tenth year!) is one of the classics of the genre.  His loopy, lovable characters and deadpan look at daily life make Clutch always a joy to read.
<p> CLUTCH #22/INVINCIBLE SUMMER #19 by Clutch and Nicole Georges. Every once in awhile, Greg and Nicole team up for an amazing split diary zine, and this is one of them! It's very cool to see how they each spend the same days, sometimes 1000's of miles apart. In this issue Greg bites his lip and Nicole goes on tour. So good! 7" x 7"; 32 pages in maroon ink; $2.00
<p> ?NEW! -- COLIBRI #4: The new issue of this Spanish anthology features all work IN ENGLISH or subtitled, so don't be afraid to check it out!

<p> ?NEW! - SKYSCRAPERS OF THE MIDWEST by Josh Cotter (AdHouse Books): Observing the isolated existence of an adolescent cat, his younger brother and their overactive imaginations in the American Heartland, Skyscrapers of the Midwest serves as an intimate chronicle of their stories of childhood hope, panic and loss.

<p> Line Gamache, from Cyclops.
<p> KEN DAHL is the pseudonym of Gabby Schulz, which is the pseudonym of.... ????  In any case Gabby makes amazing, funny, angry and heartfelt comics that belie his punk rock soul.  One of the best cartoonists going.
<p> MONSTERS by Ken Dahl (Gabby Schulz):  This amazing book delves into the personal side of a disease few people want to discuss-- Herpes-- in a brutally honest, yet side-splittingly funny way.  While accurately rendering the emotional swings of dealing with chronic illness-- its profound effect on the individual as well as all those around them, their relationships, self-confidence, and self-perception-- Schulz has pulled off the seemingly-impossible:  this book had me laughing out loud. "Part fiction, part deranged educational film strip, Monsters explores the physical and emotional traumas of an STD that affects no two people the same. Dahl cements his status among the best cartoonists of his generation with this brutally sincere account of disease and self-acceptance." (Secret Acres).  One of the best books of recent years.  212 pages, 7" x 7", perfect-bound;  $18.00.

Additionally, we are treated to helpful guides to putting bananas in your cereal, peeing in the shower, and swinging at night.  Savagely funny, and a 2006 Ignatz Winner!  128 pages, 5.5" x 7", b+w with color covers;  $9.00.
<p> ?NEW! - WEATHER by Gabby Schulz (Secret Acres):  Brutal and funny screed on the repulsiveness of the human condition has Schulz's Every-Loser, Gordon Smalls, taking an airplane ride to hell.
