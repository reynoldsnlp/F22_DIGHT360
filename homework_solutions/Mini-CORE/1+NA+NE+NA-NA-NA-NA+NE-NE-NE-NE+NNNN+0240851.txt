<h> Aston from JLS is going to help judge people's dance moves on Got To Dance
<p> Story filed by Brad O'Mance on August 14, 2012
<p> Pop's greatest exponent of the back flip (apols Mel C) Aston Merrygold will replace Adam Garcia as a judge on Sky One's Got To Dance.
<p> According to the BBC , Aston is "buzzing" about his new job, which starts in January 2013, and will see him dolling out advice while sitting near former Pussycat Dolls frontwoman Kimberly Wyatt and Ashley Banjo from Diversity.
<p> The departing Garcia had this to say to everyone's second favourite JLS member: "I want to wish Aston all the best and hope he has as much fun on this show as I did."
