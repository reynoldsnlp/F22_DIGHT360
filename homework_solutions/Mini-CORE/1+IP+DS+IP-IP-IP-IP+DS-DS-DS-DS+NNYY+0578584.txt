<h> Book Description
<p> Publication Date: January 18, 2008
<p> Softcover Edition. If ideas are the currency of our times then this is, undoubtedly, the Age of Conversation, for without the art of dialog, the cut and thrust of debate and discussion, then the economy of ideas would implode under its own heavy weight. Instead, the reverse is true. Far from seeing an implosion, we are living in a time of proliferation - ideas build upon ideas, discussion grows from seeds of thought and single headlines give rise to a thousand medusa-like simulations echoing words whispered somewhere on the other side of the planet. All this - in an instant. In what began as a half dare, the editors, Gavin Heaton and Drew McLellan challenged bloggers around the world to contribute one page - 400 words - on the topic of "conversation". The resulting book, The Age of Conversation, brings together over 100 of the world's leading marketers, writers, thinkers and creative innovators in a ground-breaking and unusual publication.

<p> The Age of Conversation is a book about the conversations that are transforming the business marketing landscape. It is about how various marketing disciplines such as advertising, internet advertising, public relations and journalism have to change the way they talk to their consumers to be heard. It emphasizes that the most important part in a conversation is listening. This is why it is important :)
<p> It is a remarkable book with many authors, each giving a very personal view on the topic of conversation - in the broadest sense. As an internet publisher I engage in a conversation with many thousands of visitors each day. Marketing managersm Journalists all have conversations with the audiences they try to reach. And the audience tries to start conversations with brands and companies - sometimes even succeeding. Mainstream media, the web, blogs, PR professionals, everyone is part of the conversation :)
<p> I got the book from a friend, at just the right time. It was very helpful in figuring out how communication is changing in the information age. The origin is simple; Editors Gavin Heaton and Drew McLellan challenged bloggers around the world to contribute one page -- 400 words -- on the topic of the conversation. Over a 100 responded, and this book is the result. It is a stunning effort, and I recommend it warmly. I gave my first copy away and bought a couple more. Currently I have one left. I cherish it.
<p> This book was written collaboratively by 103 authors scattered all over the world. It provides a wealth and variety of insights about conversational marketing (social media) from an incredible breadth of perspectives. Lots of gems here.
<p> I think it's the 103 different views that I find most valuable. All the authors are writing with the same basic ideas in mind, yet their own experiences and personalities create stories and lessons that approach the subject in a different way.
