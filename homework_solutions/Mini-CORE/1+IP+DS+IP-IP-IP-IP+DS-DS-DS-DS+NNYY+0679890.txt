<p> The Case of Lena S. follows the life, loves, and coming-of-age of sixteen-year-old Mason Crowe during a year in which he will learn what it truly means to be in the world. At the centre of the novel is Lena, a troubled girl who has "chosen" Mason and will teach him something of desire and despair. Impulsive, provocative, vulnerable, and sad, Lena becomes haunting for Mason in ways he does not always understand. We meet Mason's first "love," an older girl destined for an arranged marriage; his mother, who takes a lover; and a wise and erudite blind man with a voyeuristic streak, to whom Mason reads. Playful, and with deadpan humour, the novel brilliantly captures the yearnings of youth, as well as the tantalizing possibilities and the confounding absurdities that sometimes lie at the heart of our most intimate relationships.

<h> From Amazon
<p> Set in Winnipeg, The Case of Lena S. features a tragic heroine, a confused aspiring teenage poet from a broken family, and various wise mentors. In short, it has all the necessary ingredients for a traumatic coming-of-age story along the lines of Ordinary People . Mason Crowe is a high school student just beginning to discover the opposite sex at a time of strife in his parents' marriage. Lena Schellendal is the troubled young woman for whom, after a false start with a young woman already spoken for in an arranged East Indian marriage, he falls. Danny Crowe is the older brother who can't keep his eyes on his own model girlfriend when one of Mason's paramours is around, while Mr. Ferry, a blind man to whom Mason reads, and Ms. Abendschade, a high school teacher with a narrative speedbump of a name, are the guides giving out valuable lessons about writing, life, and women.
<p> Winnipeg writer David Bergen, here on his third novel, has a prose style as flat as the Manitoba prairie, even when he breaks, Dave Eggers style, into footnotes: "What [Mr. Ferry] doesn't tell Mason is that his wife left him for another man. Later, during their readings, he will describe this in greater detail," reads one. The footnotes bolster the idea of the book as a case study, but despite its title, The Case of Lena S. is far more a portrait of young Mason's relationships with women in general than of Lena herself. Mason, though, is quite unformed, and it's only when the relatively unorthodox Lena comes onto the scene that Bergen's prose takes off: "[Mason] loved it when [Ms. Abendschade] talked about longing and regret and described the girl swinging her hair like a rope, and he wanted to ask her questions about Lena, about what Lena Schellendal might want from him and what he, Mason, should do about her." Ultimately, Lena S. is as much a mystery to Bergen as she is to his young hero, and as such she remains an enigma to the reader long after the final page of The Case of Lena S. --Shawn Conner
<h> Review
<p> "It is impossible not to compare David Bergen's new novel to the work of Richard Ford.....A magical piece of writing. . . . It is taut, affecting and lovely, one of those wonderful works that bears reading and rereading and that in its hard crystalline prose does everything right." -- Calgary Herald
<p> "A heart-breaking account of an adolescent adrift in a world with no boundaries.... This novel is the best yet from a writer who specializes in that rare novelistic skill these days, the depiction of character. In this case, Bergen's evocation of the innocent joined with the sinister is unforgettable." -- Toronto Star
<p> "Enthralling.... A trenchant and thought-provoking work of fiction." -- Winnipeg Free Press
<p> "A deeply beautiful book." -- Edmonton Journal
<p> "Compelling.... An exploration of the quiet desperation of teenagers on the edge of adulthood...." -- Globe and Mail
<p> "Spare, lucid, haunting and overlaid with melancholy. . . . It's a terrific performance.... Bergen is simply too good and too clear-eyed a writer to ever circle around the truth of his subject. His subject here, the emotional and physical lives of teenagers, is revealed as both sad and perplexing.... A deeply beautiful book." -- Edmonton Journal
<p> "Goes well beyond the traditional coming-of-age chronicle to pose problems of loss and rejection and to set these questions against the uncertainties of young adulthood.... The book is well written and insightful and captures the clamour, chaos and fractured idiom of youth as it passes into adulthood. As a commentary on the priorities of the young, The Case of Lena S. ranks high indeed." -- London Free Press
<p> "Bergen's language flows and his descriptions are tantalizing." -- FFWD
<p> After reading The Case of Lean S., I am struck that a satisfying "coming of age" story can have a great significance for the reader who feels the youthful search for identity is past. The sensitive sixteen year old Mason Crowe explores opportunities which will be lost in adulthood. He seeks a meaningful life. While admiring his English teacher, he gives critical observations about the superficial values of his older brother's life. Lena's allure is engaging and damaging, but unavoidable for the development of his character. Mason's story shows the prescience of our youthful observations. The reader is reminded that a better understanding of ourselves lie in dreams and lessons of our youth.
<p> Excellent,amazing. I can't explain in words, this book has to be read in order to understand.I can give you a summary, but this isn't an english assignment. This book is a must read, and if this review didn't help at all, read the book, that will help. Commercial books aren't always better, it's the one's hidding underneath that really leave a scar.
<p> David Bergen's latest book, The Case of Lena S. is set in Winnipeg, Canada. In this story we meet 16-year old Mason Crowe, youngest and most stable member of a family which is falling apart. Mason is bewitched by Lena, a girl from a solid religious family, yet, she herself is falling apart.
<p> Lena is a bold and intelligent teen-ager possessing an empty soul which she attempts to fill with sex and sometimes with religion. She seems to view Mason as having potential in filling her and he does his best to please her sexually and otherwise but ultimately she withholds herself.
<p> Mason's longing for Lena parallels that of Kierkegaard's longing for Regine. Kierkegaard's works are introduced to Mason by a blind and elderly voyeur, Mr. Ferry, to whom Mason reads on Tuesday and Thursday nights.
<p> Reading and books concern Mason. Besides reading as a job, he receives and gives books as gifts, he steals them, and it is when discussing books that he develops a crush on his English Teacher. Mason himself keeps a book in which he records his yearnings, titled, "The Lena Poems."
<p> Mr. Bergen provides the reader with backstage asides via footnotes. These comments provide sexual details, analysis, and mostly comic relief. When Mason wonders if his mother's lover has a larger penis than his father, Footnote#10 tells us.."He did. It was thicker and longer."
<p> This book, however does not leave one laughing. When the last page is turned the reader is deeply satisfied with this look into teen-age lives and human longing, but not happy. But then, as Mr. Ferry says to Mason, "Happy books aren't as interesting."
