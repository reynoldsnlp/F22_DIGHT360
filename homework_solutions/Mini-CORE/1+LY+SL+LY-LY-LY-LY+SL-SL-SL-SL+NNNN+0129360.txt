<h> For A Moment Lyrics
<h> Ron Sexsmith
<p> For a moment there I could've swore I knew where I was going For a moment there I was in my room following the music Never knowing if it was going anywhere I could hear it in the sky above In the streets below me I could hear it in the songs of love Just enough to show me There was a light somewhere, somewhere For a moment there The sun was in my eyes and I was blinded For a moment there But now I look again and when it seems Like all is lost I find it or it finds me anyway I can see it in the sun above In the grass below me I see it in the ones I love Just enough to show me There is a light somewhere For a moment there I could see it in the ones I love Just enough to show me There is a light somewhere
