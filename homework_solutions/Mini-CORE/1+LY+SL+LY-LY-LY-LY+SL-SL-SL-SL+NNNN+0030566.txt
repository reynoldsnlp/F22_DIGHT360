<h> Tom Waits I Wish I Was In New Orleans lyrics
<p> Well, I wish I was in New Orleans I can see it in my dreams arm-in-arm down Burgundy a bottle and my friends and me hoist up a few tall cool ones play some pool and listen to that tenor saxophone calling me home and I can hear the band begin When the Saints Go Marching In by the whiskers on my chin New Orleans, I'll be there I'll drink you under the table be red nose go for walks the old haunts what I wants is red beans and rice and wear the dress I like so well and meet me at the old saloon make sure there's a Dixie moon New Orleans, I'll be there and deal the cards roll the dice if it ain't that ole Chuck E. Weiss and Clayborn Avenue me and you Sam Jones and all and I wish I was in New Orleans I can see it in my dreams arm-in-arm down Burgundy a bottle and my friends and me New Orleans, I'll be there Back to Tom Waits lyrics
