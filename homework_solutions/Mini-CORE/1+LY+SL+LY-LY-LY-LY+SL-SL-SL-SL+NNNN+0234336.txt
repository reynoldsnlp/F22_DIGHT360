<h> Trying To Get To You Lyrics
<p> I've been traveling over mountains Even through the valleys, too I've been traveling night and day I've been running all the way Baby, trying to get to you.
<p> Ever since I read your letter Where you said you loved me true I've been traveling night and day I've been running all the way baby, trying to get to you
<p> When I read your loving letter Then my heart began to sing There were many miles between us, But they didn't mean a thing. [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/elvis+presl\\... ] I just had to reach you, baby, In spite of all that I've been through. I kept traveling night and day, I kept running all the way, Baby, trying to get to you.
<p> Well if I had to do it over That's exactly what I'd do, I would travel night and day, And I'd still run all the way, Baby, trying to get to you.
