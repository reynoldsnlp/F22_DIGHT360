<p> With the rare combination of profound psychological insight and deep spirituality that has already drawn millions of readers to his two great New York Times bestsellers, The Seat of the Soul and Soul Stories , prize-winning author Gary Zukav now joins with his spiritual partner Linda Francis to help us develop a new emotional awareness that is central to our spiritual development.
<p> In The Seat of the Soul , Zukav brilliantly set forth his fundamental concepts, explaining how the expansion of human perception beyond the five senses leads to a new understanding of power as the alignment of the personality with the soul -- authentic power.

Now, in another New York Times Bestseller, The Heart of the Soul , he and Francis take the next major step forward in showing us the importance of emotional awareness in applying these concepts to our daily lives.
<p> Emotional awareness -- becoming aware in your body of everything you are feeling at every moment -- is one of the most challenging tasks you can undertake. As Zukav relates in the book, "The longest journey that you will make in your life is from your head to your heart." This is the unending journey toward spiritual growth, toward wholeness, wisdom, and compassion, and the healing that will allow you to achieve your fullest potential.
<p> Turn the experiences of your life into a continual flow of information that is vital and the basis of your transformation. Begin the journey from your head to your heart.Filled with helpful tools, empowering practices, and compelling drawings, The Heart of the Soul is a life-changing book to read many times over.
