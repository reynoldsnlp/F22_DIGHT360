<h> I Think You Know What I Mean Lyrics
<h> Lyle Lovett
<p> I walked in his office He told me pull up a chair And he looked in my eyes With a cold steely stare And he spoke with a wisdom That I'd never heard And as I was hanging On every last word He said son I think you know what I mean He said son I think you know what I mean He said son I think you know what I mean He said the hallway is lonesome And the hallway is long And one end is shiny And one end is gone And the middle burns brightly With the color of night And the doors are all open But no one's inside He said son I think you know what I mean He said son I think you know what I mean He said son I think you know what I mean [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/i-think-you-k\\... ] Hell he hollered And he hopped up And he kicked back his chair And he said I'd be stupid If I didn't care To understand better Would leave him no doubt In a world full of something That I'd be without He said son I think you know what I mean He said son I think you know what I mean He said son I think you know what I mean But it's springtime in texas And my memory grows faint As the bluebonnets dance With the indian paints The highway is lonesome But the highway is straight And some things are heavy But they ain't worth the weight I think you know what I mean I think you know what I really mean I think you know what I mean I think you know what I mean I think you know what I really mean I think you know what I mean
