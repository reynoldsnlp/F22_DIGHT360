<h> That's the way to do it - Health and Safety meets its match in Punch
<p> When Punch and Judy man Glyn Edwards was threatened with a health and safety assessment he fought back the only way he knew ... on stage.
<p> He's made a new arch-villain in the shape of a balding health and safety inspector, dressed in a yellow fluorescent jacket, who regularly gets a whack with the slap-stick.
<p> Mr Edwards said: "I got the idea when I received a letter from my local authority saying I should fill-in a risk assessment form for my show.
<p> "Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous? This is a Punch and Judy show with puppets and a tented stage. What are they suggesting could happen? "I wrote back to the council refusing to comply and they backed off.
<p> "We've run into the dreaded health and safety issue before.
<p> "We performed at a fete in a field recently and I was astonished to see a health and safety sign up warning us to wear suitable footwear in case it rained.
<p> "At another venue, I saw a health and safety sign in toilets, offering five instructions on how to wash your hands.
<p> "It's madness - they'll be telling us how to blow our noses next." Mr Edwards, 63, said his new puppet gets the greatest laugh among adults:
<p> "He's a target for humour because the whole notion of health and safety has gotten out of hand. Inspectors are over zealous and have become a joke."
<p> The inspector intervenes during sketches involving a crocodile puppet and when sausages make an appearance.
<p> Mr Edwards said: "He asks whether Punch has made risk assessments before allowing the props on stage - it always gets a laugh."
<p> Mr Edwards, former producer of Saturday kids' TV show Tiswas, travels from his home in Worthing, West Sussex, all over the world to put on shows.
<p> He said: "The inspector goes down well everywhere - health and safety has become infectious and Punch is all about bringing idiots and lunacy to light."
