<h> More About the Author
<p> Mike Slaughter is Lead Pastor and Chief Dreamer of Ginghamsburg United Methodist Church in Tipp City, Ohio. Located in the struggling "rust belt," Ginghamsburg strives to be the hands and feet of Jesus, serving those in need from Dayton to Darfur. Under Mike's leadership, the church has grown from 90 worshipers a week to over 5,000. Mike's books include "Christmas Is Not Your Birthday," "Change the World," "Spiritual Entrepreneurs," "Real Followers," "Momentum for Life," "UnLearning Church," and "Upside Living in a Downside Economy."
<p> Out on the edge of the traditional congregation a media reformation is occurring. One place where this reformation can be seen is at Ginghamsburg Church in Tipp City, Ohio. Another place is in this book by its lead pastor.
<p> Michael Slaughter has been the lead pastor of this congregation since 1979. Upon his arrival at Ginghamsburg he found 90 persons who existed as a dying United Methodist congregation. At the time of this writing, a core membership group of more than 1000 persons provide five weekend worship experiences for more than 3000 persons.
<p> The congregation has a contemporary style that attracts preChristians, seekers, and others on the edge of Christianity. Simultaneously, for those who understand the subtle presentation of theology and Christian symbolism, there are more than enough places to connect with spiritual trandition and culture.
<p> Through the medium of this book Michael Slaughter shares his convictions concerning the life and death nature of the media reformation, a postmodern approach to congregation, and methodologies for building effective multi-sensory worship leadership teams.
<p> A bonus is a CD-ROM included with the book. It contains materials that talks about the process of designing worship, six sample worship scenarios, a media portfolio of selected worship elements, and a searchable text of this book.
<p> In addition to buying and reading this book, take advantage of visiting the congregation when you are in the Cincinnati area, or attend one of their annual teaching church events.
<p> I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Slaughter's book! He gives a great,concise overview of how times have changed in the way of communication. It helped me realize that many churches have remained content to use methodologies that may have worked 20 or more years ago while neglecting technology that has created a new paradigm for effective, relevant communication. Mr. Slaughter includes actual job descriptions and schedules of key people needed to produce, what he calls, a multi-sensory worship experience. A very helpful cd-rom is included with several examples of what he describes in the book. If you are involved in planning worship services, you need this book!
<p> This book is one of few that admits that the Church has very little to do with real life for most people in society despite the fact that belief in God is growing in America.
<p> It is a good description of how one little church started with a new vision for the future, and the accompanying cd-rom shows in graphic detail how they have managed to re-create what the word church means.
<p> The first book you should read if you are interested in starting a contemporary worship service or in using multimedia, or just motivating your church to think ahead and renew its vision.
<p> One of few good books on the subject that isn't laden with fundamentalism, it really speaks to people all over the theological spectrum.
