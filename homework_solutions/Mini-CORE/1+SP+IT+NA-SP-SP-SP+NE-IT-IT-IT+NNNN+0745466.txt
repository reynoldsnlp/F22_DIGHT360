<h> 'The Book Thief' History Unfolds as a Result of Choices
<p> A guest post by Julia Rappaport of Facing History and Ourselves, an educational non-profit organization and key partner in the Now Is The Time initiative. --- We're excited that The Book Thief, the award-winning novel by Australian writer Markus Zusak, has been selected as the One Book One Chicago fall 2012 selection. This month, the Steppenwolf for Young Adults program will put on a stage adaptation of the book. Here are tips from Rebecca Ward, a program associate in Facing History's Chicago office , on teaching the book in the classroom. Ward recently co-facilitated an after-school workshop for educators about The Book Thief and the lessons from the novel that can spark class-wide discussion about the choices we make and the ways we can participate in society.
<p> Facing History and Ourselves: What is The Book Thief about?
<p> Ward : The book is set in Germany before and during World War II. It tells the story of Liesel Meminger, a young girl who risks everything for her love of books, and follows the everyday German people on her small street as they try to survive in the midst of poverty, the Nazi occupation, and Allied air raids. Amidst this chaos, Liesel finds refuge in reading. But when her father, who is not Jewish, decides to hide a Jewish stranger in the family's basement, Liesel comes to understand the true power of knowledge.
<p> Ward : The Book Thief does an excellent job of covering a history that Facing History explores in our own resources and publications -- 1930s and World War II Germany. The book looks at what we call "bystander" and "upstander" behavior, the choices that everyday people make. At Facing History, we spend a lot of time exploring the idea that things in history are not inevitable, that history unfolds as a result of choices made by people like you and me. In this book, you really see how those very small choices make really big differences.
<p> Facing History : Can you describe a moment in the book that really resonates with you?
<p> Ward : There's one moment that always jumps out in my mind. One day, Nazi soldiers march a group of Jews through the town where the book is set. They are on their way to Dachau, the German concentration camp. Liesel's dad, his name is Hans, is watching these people march through the streets. Without thinking, he steps out into the road and gives a piece of bread to one of the Jews -- a man who was starving. Later in the book, Liesel and her best friend also throw bread in the streets before another group of Jews is marched through the town. It's a beautiful example of how one person's actions can inspire others to act, too.
<p> Facing History : How can Chicago-area teachers continue classroom conversations about choice and upstander behavior after students have read the book?
<p> Ward : Facing History's traveling multimedia exhibition Choosing to Participate is on view at the Chicago Public Library, Harold Washington Library Center until November 11. The exhibit encourages people of all ages to recognize and learn about a democratic society by looking at stories that show courage, initiative, and compassion. The exhibit has a special feature that celebrates local, often unsung heroes that are making a difference in Chicago. Educators can sign up now to tour the exhibit with their classes.
<p> Facing History: If you were in Liesel's shoes and you had to rescue just one book, which book would it be?
<p> Ward : I think I might actually save The Book Thief! I just love it that much! It would either be that or A Prayer for Owen Meany [by John Irving].
