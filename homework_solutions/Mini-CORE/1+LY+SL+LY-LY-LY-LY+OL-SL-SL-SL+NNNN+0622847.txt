A D Em G You that I needed all along A D Em G I felt like a fool A D Em G A D Kicking and screaming and pretending we were wrong (Repeat Intro) Verse: D A Let's get wrecked on poptarts and sex and see the Taj Mahal D A Let's save birds from Prince William Sound and skateboard through the mall D A Let's fight crimes with mangoes and limes and join the PGA D A Let's win big with every spin, but hurry I can't wait [ Tab from: http://www.guitaretab.com/m/motion-city-\\... ] Refrain 2: (single strum) G D A Do you spend a fortune on those late night prepaid television scams G D A In search of the perfect brand of steak knife and non-stick frying pan? Chorus 2: D Em G What if it was you? A D Em G You that I needed all along A D Em G I felt like a fool A D Em G Thinking we were completely wrong A D It seemed like a dream Em A beautiful scream G A D That echoed forever and made us not afraid to feel the same And after it ends Em We'll try to be friends G A D And they say what doesn't kill us makes us who we are Bridge: D --- F#m 2x D F#m All this time and everything's changed, but I still feel the same D F#m All good things eventually end and get washed down the drain G D A What a disaster it would be if you discovered that I cared G D A A little too much for friends, but not enough to share Chorus 3: D Em G What if it was you? A D Em G You that I needed all along A D Em G I felt like a fool A D Em G Now that I know that I was wrong A D Em G It had to be you A D Em G It had to be you A D Em G It had to be you A D Em G A D F#m I knew it was you
