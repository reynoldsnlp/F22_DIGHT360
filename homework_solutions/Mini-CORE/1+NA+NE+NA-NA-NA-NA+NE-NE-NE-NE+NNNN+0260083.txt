<h> Sarah Palin To Israelis: "Why Are You Apologizing All The Time?"
<p> ABC News' Mary Bruce Reports: Sarah Palin made her first pilgrimage to the Holy Land on Sunday, joining a long line of presidential hopefuls who have traveled to Israel prior to throwing their hat in the ring.
<p> During a tour of the Western Wall Palin expressed support for Jews praying openly at the Temple Mount asking her Israeli tour guides, "why are you apologizing all the time?" The Jerusalem Post reported .
<p> The Temple Mount, a holy site to both Jews and Muslims, is one of the world's most contested religious sites.
<p> One of Palin's tour guides World Likud Chairman Danny Danon said Palin "really connected to the story of the Jewish nation."
<p> According to The Jerusalem Post, Danon said "I can clearly say from the questions she asked in relation to our conflict here with the Muslims in these holy sites that she knows that we are right and that the Muslims are just claiming things for provocation and they're not right."
<p> The former Alaska governor prayed at the Wall and left a note with a personal prayer in it.
<p> "It's overwhelming to be able to see and touch the cornerstone of our faith," Palin reportedly said. "I'm so thankful to be able to be here, and I'm thankful to know the Israel-American connection will grow and strengthen as the peace negotiations continue."
<p> Palin's trip to Israel comes on the heels of her visit to India over the weekend. On Monday Palin and her husband Todd will have dinner with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara at their residence in Jerusalem.
<p> "As the world confronts sweeping changes and new realities, I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the key issues facing his country, our ally Israel," Palin said in a statement on her PAC website .
<p> Although the 2008 vice presidential nominee remains mum about her 2012 intentions, several of Palin's potential rivals for the GOP candidacy have also met with Netanyahu in recent months, including former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.
<p> Palin has said recently it could be several months before she decides whether or not to run in 2012.
<p> Israel has discovered two large off shore natural gas fields that lessen the amount of gas & oil they need to import. Unlike the Obama administrating and Congressional Democrat who opposes energy development in the USA, Israel will develop the gas they have found. They can also convert the gas to gasoline, diesel fuel & jet fuel just as South Africa is doing. Once again Israel shows that they are smarter than the Obama Administration and Congress in many areas especially energy development. Also when Israel occupied the Sinai they developed farming & tourism that made them a lot of money and increased their available fresh food. When the Sinai was returned to Egypt, the farms and the hotels were allowed to die under the Government of Egypt.

<p> I real hope one of these retreads and blowhards runs for president, not because they have a chance of winning but because I like to see the train wreck that they will cause.

Mike Huckabee "The Huckster Reverend", former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. "The I Love the Gays", former UN Ambassador John Bolton "The I Love The War " I Finace Myself: former Massachusetts Gov.

<p> Where are the Republicans who were screaming about Obama campaigning abroad as though he were already president?

<p> Nice to see that Palin derangement syndrome has not lessened with time. Liberalism is a mental disorder. Proved daily in every media medium know to man. I don't want Sarah as President. I want her as US Attorney General. Time to clean the house. "progressives" fear Palin like know one else I know. What a perfect choice to get to the bottom of the communist barrel the "Demo-rat" party crawled out of. McCarthy was a piker.

<p> "why are you apologizing all the time?" Nobody else would have the same cut-to-the-chase directness. I love it when politicians speak frankly. You know exactly where she stands, unlike Mr. Obama. I realize there are negatives in many people's minds due to the astonishing bias (or perhaps outright bigotry) of the majority of reporters in America (witness the witless above comment, "It's amazing Palin could find Israel."). The same folks heard Obama say "...we've visited 57 states...(long pause)...and that leaves one more to go," and call it a sign of brilliance.

<p> Seriously? This woman wants to be president of the United States and this is what she wears to one of the holiest sites in the world. Where is the respect?
<p> Palin is the anti-politician when she asks "why do you apologize all the time?" I've been to Israel a dozen times and although I'm not Jewish, I admire them greatly for their incredible endurance and tough adherence to superior moral codes. As an Arabist, I am aware of the lack of moral codes and work ethic of some of their neighboring countries, particularly Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, where I have lived for almost a decade. I admire the Jordanians and their Bedouin ethic, unspoiled by oil and money, but as for Syria, Iraq, the KSA & even the Egyptians and Turks, there is no comparison as to both a modern frame of mind and an ability to wring a lot of out few natural resources.
<p> Palin vs Obama in the next election. I figure it is going to be Palin by a 2 to 1 victory. Obama is trainwrecking himself quick. It won't necessarily mean the country supports Palin, but just that the country no longer supports Obama.
