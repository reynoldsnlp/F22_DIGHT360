<p> Lose yourself in timeless love with this gloriously romantic story of the journey of two hearts. Artist Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams of The Notebook) shares a deep emotional bond with Henry De Tamble (Eric Bana of The Other Boleyn Girl), a handsome librarian who travels involuntarily through time. Knowing they can be separated without warning, Clare and Henry treasure the moments they have together, imbuing them with the yearning and passion of two people imprisoned by time...and set free by love. Based on the #1 bestseller, The Time Traveler's Wife weaves together destiny and devotion, past and future to turn an extraordinary love into an extraordinary love story.
<p> I thought this was a great love story. Obviously you had to accept Time Travel as an affliction like any other debilitating condition because that is how it is portrayed in this movie. But the love shown between the main characters transcended the actual affliction. The movie was about a love so great that for the two to experience it even if for a short time was worth the sadness that later occurs. I thought both actors portrayed the deep love of the characters quite well. For those that have never seen or had that type of love in their life it can be hard to imagine and accept.
<p> If you do not like deep love stories then skip the movie. If you cannot accept or overlook the time travel metaphor then skip the movie. If you nitpick about every minor detail requiring that they be 100% correct then skip this movie. If on the other hand, you want to see what true love is, you might like this movie. If you like What If movies with love as a central theme then you might like this movie.
<p> THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is a diversion. At times what works well in a novel doesn't translate to the screen: the magic of the reader's imagination can be more powerful than the visualization of a screenwriter and director. Such is the case of Audrey Niffenegger's novel - an escape into a world of the unknown (time traveling) that played well on the page largely due to the writing skill of the author. Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay makes a mighty attempt to make visual the imaginary magic of the novel and thanks to CGI it pulls off the rather strange effects of appearing and disappearing of a time traveler. Robert Schwentke directs with a hefty dose of saccharine though, making what could have been a delicate story somewhat lugubrious.
<p> Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has the genetic code that allows him to travel backward and forward in time - a trait that requires a certain degree of acceptance on the part of the audience. We see Henry as a child, as a young man who meets a girl who will on a different 'trip' be a woman Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams), and witness a bizarre courtship between a couple whose match seems made in heaven.... Along the way Clare's friends (Jane McLean as Charisse and Ron Livingston as a vastly different Gomez than in the novel) figure into the quasi-normal relationship/marriage that takes place. The tale can be confusing if the viewer is not willing to enter the realm of 'possible' and the main guide of the film seems to focus on the fact that whenever Henry time travels, he ends up in his new destination naked (there are many scenes of Eric Bana just searching for clothes). Of course the film can't have a logical ending, but the ending selected, corny though it is, fits the story. Lots of sugar to swallow here, but if you're in a Valentine mood it is a pleasant diversion. Grady Harp, February 10
<p> I saw this movie 2 days after I finished reading the book. Going into this I knew that there would be many things that would be changed or left out due to the book being almost 600 pages and the movie was 107 minutes. I had a realistic expectation about the movie - I have learned from past disappointments.
<p> Henry DeTamble is played by Eric Bana and Clare Abshire is played by Rachel McAdams. Both actors looked a lot like what I pictured the characters to look like in my head. I also think that they had amazing chemistry together. I also LOVED the little girl that played Clare (age 6) when she first meets Henry - she was great.
<p> My feelings for this moving are slightly above average - the parts that were included from the book were done very well. They stuck pretty close to the events of the book but left out a lot - which made my boyfriend, who hasn't read the book, ask a lot of questions about the plot holes. I think if you had read the book before seeing the movie it would be easier to follow what was happening. I had been wondering how they would show Henry evaporating from one time and appearing in another - I think they did an AWESOME job at this - some amazing CG. Beautifully rendered.
<p> For anyone who has read the book - the ending is not the same. It evokes similar emotion - and those who have not read the book, have told me they loved the ending. I was a little disappointed because I loved the book ending.
