Girl, there's somethin' I can guarantee That you won't be cravin' lovin' for a while 'Cause I'm gonna give you all of me I want you to bust on top of me I wanna feel the thrust of your lovin', baby I want you to tell me when I hit the spot Girl, I'm tryin' to make it hot Baby, come and take my hand I just wanna freak you Girl, I got what you want, now it's time for you to Climb up on top of me Girl I want you on top of me I got what your body needs (Yes I can do what I can do with you, baby) There's a vacancy in ecstasy And I'm gonna take you there Girl I want you on top of me I got what your body needs, yeah There's a vacancy in ecstasy And I'm gonna take you there I came here to please your body, baby I know I'll satisfy your every need All you have to do is trust me Girl, I'll take you to ecstasy, yeah Girl I want you on top of me I got what your body needs (Girl I want you on top of me) But there's only one way that I want it (I got what your body needs) I want you naked and on top of me Forever baby, baby, yeah, babe I want you, my baby (Girl I want you on top of me) Girl I'm going to give to you like you never had it before (I got what your body needs) Oh, no, no, no, no, no, oh (Girl I want you on top of me) I want you, babe 'cause I need you babe Everything you are I wanna drive you crazy (I got what your body needs) Come in my arms, let me take control 'Cause I'm about to take you there And I know, I know what I'm doin', baby, my baby All them other men you had before me You're gonna forget about all that experience
