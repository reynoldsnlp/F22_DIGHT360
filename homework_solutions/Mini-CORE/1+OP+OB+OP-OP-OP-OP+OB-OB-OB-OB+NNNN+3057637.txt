<p> Award shows are very often mind numbingly boring. After three hours of watching rich people being told how wonderful they are by other rich people every year I ask myself why I even bothered to stay up so late to watch something that ultimately I could have found out all the results to had I gone to bed and looked them up on the Internet the next day.
<p> The thing is often award shows have the very occasionally fantastic moment that convince me that I didn't waste my time spending three hours for absolutely nothing. That said, you could make the very valid argument that all the funniest and greatest bits from the award shows would have been available on Youtube the next day any way. If you are the type of person who would make that argument, you are the type of person who will love this list.
<p> Often award shows peak after the first 10 minutes because usually the host spends most of their time planning, writing and orchestrating fantastically original hooks to capture the audiences attention and leave them wanting more (which unfortunately they rarely ever get). In recent years musical numbers have been somewhat of a big deal again in Hollywood and I for one couldn't be more happy out this.  Be as cynical as you want, but I guarantee you wont be able to watch any one of the featured videos on this list without a big wide grin appearing on your face.
<p> Collected within are what I consider to be the funniest, greatest and most epic opening numbers to the Emmy's, the Tony's and the Oscar's. If you don't watch these award shows prepare to be blown away by the following clips... and if you do, feel free to enjoy them once again...
