<p> Early in the mornin' Well just a little bit Around midnight Just a little bit I want an eeny weeny bit A teeny weeny bit of your love
<p> Walk with me Just a little bit I said talk to me Just a little bit I want an eeny weeny bit A teeny weeny bit of your love
<p> I want you to remember To say that you'll be mine Say you'll never leave me Till the end of time I want an eeny weeny bit A teeny weeny bit of your love I want an eeny weeny bit A teeny weeny bit of your love
