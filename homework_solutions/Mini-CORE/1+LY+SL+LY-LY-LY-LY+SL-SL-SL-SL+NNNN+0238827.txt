<h> Do You Think About Me Lyrics
<p> That first cold September night You were the blanket holding me tight You were kissing me and the years stood still You said we don't have to I said I will, yeah
<p> We ran in when the thunder came You told me sugar melts in the rain Don't want to watch our love go to waste So we ran inside before it was too late
<p> Oh I, Oh I I'm not even trying Oh I, Oh I But I can't stop smiling Yeah Do you think about me Like I think about you Do you think about me Like I think about you Yeah [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/carrie+unde\\... ] I moved on to another town Wrote you letters til the ink ran out When the clouds rolled in, I'd grabbed the keys And play that song that we used to sing I met a boy a lot like you It's funny how we used to sing it too But he was always just a little out of key So much different than you and me
<p> Oh I, Oh I I'm not even trying Oh I, Oh I But I can't stop smiling Yeah Do you think about me Like I think about you Do you think about me Like I think about you
<p> Sometimes I wonder if you wonder What it could've been like When you're sitting there drinking coffee Are you thinking of me, When it's thundering and raining outside
<p> Oh I, Oh I I'm not even trying Oh I, Oh I But I can't stop smiling Oh I, Oh I It's sending me flying Oh I, Oh I But I can't stop smiling, yeah Do you think about me Like I think about you Do you think about me Like I think about you Do you think about me Like I think about you Do you think about me...
