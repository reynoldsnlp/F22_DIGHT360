<h> Review
<p> No one since James Ellroy has conveyed the morally troubled heart of the American dream with such savage aim, and Winslow cleverly adds a pointed political dimension to his saga. A future classic .' Guardian
<p> 'Don Winslow is the kind of cult writer who is so good you almost want to keep him to yourself.' (Ian Rankin )
<p> 'The first great dope novel since Dog Soldiers thirty years ago. It's frightening and sad, with a superbly sustained intensity. A beautifully compressed vision of hell, with all its attendant moral madness.' (James Ellroy )
<p> The story of 40 years of history as seen through the eyes of two men on either side of the drugs trade. It will open your mind and should seriously make you question aspects of American Foreign policy and the truth behind the War on Drugs. Full of amazing characters and beautifully written.
<p> Absolute quality that is difficult to put down. Do yourself a favour and read this book.
<p> This is one of the best crime novels I've ever read. It might make you cry; cheer; feel angry; thrilled; and exhausted. It will certainly not leave you unmoved. For those who just want action, then there is hardly a chapter without action. For those who want an interesting and intelligent read, it is that as well. It is like a cross between 'The Godfather' and 'American Tabloid'.
<p> The core of the story is the crusade of Art Keller, an American-Hispanic DEA agent, against the Barrera family, Mexican drug barons, who he meets as a young man at the beginning of his career, is initially friendly with, but soon becomes their dedicated enemy. The fight between them lasts nearly thirty years.
<p> It is also a tale of political expediency; cynical pragmatism and corruption. The Mexican government feels it cannot afford to crack down on the drug trade; The American government have their own agenda in South America, in their fight against communism; and the Catholic church wants a way back into Mexico. So the result is a deadly minefield for anyone who dares to try to do some good.
<p> There are five main characters, whose lives criss cross over the years. Art Keller, the constant outsider, who understands the mentality of the barrio;Adan Barrera, who, rather like Michael Corleone, in the Godfather, turns to 'the dark side' after a brutal act of violence against him and wants into the family business; Father Juan Parada, the decent, brave priest who always speaks his mind; Nora Hayden, the call girl with a heart; and, Sean Callan, the hitman who wants out, but keeps being dragged back in. There are many more great characters.
<p> A stunning piece of work. Rewarding on every level. Immerse yourself in the history of the 'Mexican Trampoline' as drugs make their way from South America, through Mexico and into the US. Believeable characters, well drawn, travel through decades and watch their own part in this history of drugs and cocaine and USA involvement in South America and...
<p> Well the list is endless - it has pace, real drama and tension. Some parts are jaw dropping in their intensity and brutality but never gratuitous.
<p> All his other books are great - this should push him to classic writer status - up there with Ellroy in my estimations.
