<p> I do have reflexology, that's the one on the feet isn't it, yep, yes I do have that, every week, it's a friend of mine that does it. I do have that most weeks. I was her guinea pig to start with so, and it is lovely, it's wonderful. But sometimes I come away thinking ??Oh I'm more stiff than when I went?_, but yeah it does, it is good, I would recommend that to anybody, it is brilliant, and it makes you feel so relaxed, especially when she uses the oils as well, in with it. It's very good.
<p> And you know for somebody who's not familiar with it, what does she do?
<p> She usually puts some nice soothing music on and massages, wipes your feet over first and then massages them with, sometimes with oils, sometimes not with oils and she'll sort of, it's explaining, pinch and nip and, but not, not in a hurtful way, it's wonderful, massaging your feet, but it helps all over your body and she, funnily enough she can tell if you've got a headache or whatever, I never actually believed it at first, but I didn't actually tell her that I'd been having pain in my neck and she said it's really crunchy, is there something wrong with your neck, and I couldn't believe that she didn't, hadn't been told, but just by massaging my feet, it sends you to sleep, it's lovely, very relaxing. T
<p> Try it, its good. And it's not very expensive either, she actually has started charging now, but purely because of the oils and things, but when I was a guinea pig she did it for nothing, so if you've got a friend that can do it, do it [laughs]. It's very good and it helps, not just with the arthritis but it helps other things as well, stress, blood pressure, everything. And she used different oils for different things, so it is good.
<p> I didn't believe it, I didn't believe it to start with. But it is very good, maybe it just relaxes you so much that you forget about the rest of the things, whatever it is it's good, it relaxes you more than anything and it does help.
