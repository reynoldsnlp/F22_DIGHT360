<p> I had thought about it a lot but it had gotten displaced by increasing stress at work.
<p> Sometime ago, The Obama Administration did something with Medicare - I do not know exactly why or when it occurred - but it cut the per diem reimbursements we get from Medicare for treating the people we do.
<p> By now that cut means we get one half what we used to get for the same exact service. Census has doubled, my caseload has gone from 12, which was manageable, to about 26. (Managed care paperwork is endless, time-consuming, useless, and keeps me from actually treating people more and better. Excellent accomplishment.)
<p> We have dropped 2 therapists - there's me a 2 other full-time staff, and a host of part-time folks, but they just provide educational services, not case management.
<p> And health insurance is gone, axed as the company mulled whether to pack up shop altogether or continue on.
<p> They chose to continue on.
<p> Then, recently, I hear the boss and another employee talking about how they just can't vote for Obama because of this Medicare change.
<p> I was quite dismayed to hear this; it's not comforting to find your 'superiors' engaging in very ignorant thinking, but there it is. They blame "Obamacare".
<p> Honestly, I do not know enough about Obamacare to know if the cut in medicare (due to a "new interpretation in the reading of social security law - that is all I know) is REALLY due to that, or some other stunt pulled by the republicans who are always pulling stuts with Medicare.
<p> I leave political confrontation out of my workplace, for the most part.
<p> One would have to be very dense in order to NOT understand I have nothing but derision and sarcasm for Rmoney.
<p> I held my tongue, which is a messy and difficult thing to do. I told myself I just cannot get into this with them, mostly because I would come off as condescending.
<p> Even though I COULD get away with such a tirade there, I felt it was the better part of valour just to remain quiet.
<p> Anyway, long story short, I won't be voting for Obama on November 6th.
<p> I voted for Obama YESTERDAY at the South Fulton Service center on Stonewall Tell Road in Atlanta, Georgia.
<p> Bonus Race-filled Rant!
<p> I was going to vote first thing in the morning.
<p> But..... my beautiful Vietnamese wife arranged for a Vietnamese man to come to the house to work on our heat, which has quit heating. Winter and Vietnamese spouse do not mix well without heat.
<p> He was late, squashing my hopes of getting to the poll when it opened.
<p> Mr. Heat and Air finally arrived and spent a good bit of time checking things and finally diagnosed the issue as low on freon. He pumped it up and charged us...... $80.00
<p> I expected $200, you know?
<p> Then I went to the County Office to vote. At 1230 or 1 pm there was a line out of the building, down the sidewalk and down the street.
<p> I live in a predominantly black area so I am often a stand out in the crowd. I am very comfortable with that.
<p> This was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and there was a real big crowd at the office to vote.
<p> I got in, there were no problems with my registration and I was able to claim the DIEBOLD MACHINE furthest to the Left and vote there.
<p> I treated myself to Mexican food afterward - a chicken Chimichanga from the good people at Taqueria Iztaccihuatl. Delicious.
<p> So I spent the am with my Vietnamese with and her HVAC friend, hung around with my black neighbors to vote for our Black President  - AGAIN - and then spend some time with some Mexicans, eating their food and thanking them for opening their restaurant.
<p> A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?
<p> Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.
<p> If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.
<p> Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.
<p> I could post using the same title because I already sent in my absentee ballot, so I won't be voting for Obama on November 6 either. Sure felt good to vote for him the second time around - and only wish I could do it a million times!
<p> with the employee's you mentioned are that some people who are uncomfortable with a black president,will use any excuse to not vote for him. Racism in America is rampant, but people will not admit it of course. Obama will win at least 6 battleground states and the election in spite of massive fraud on the part of Republican's..
<p> "America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between" Oscar Wilde
<p> but I have been spending a LOT of time over at Yahoo news, wandering through a vast sea of racism, illiteracism, hate, stupidity, conspiratorial and paranoid delusion and that has some bearing on why I did this, though it's murky at best.
<p> Somehow, posting it like this seemed like the thing to do.
<p> Plus I wanted to highlight early voting.
<p> We should vote ASAP when we have the chance.
<p> I just realized we had Early Voting in Georgia last week and planned on it for yesterday.
<p> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
<p> First I wondered who hacked your profile, but after a few seconds, I knew you had a twist in store.  Mission accomplished, you got our attention (and BP up, as well as threw in a little anxiety to keep us honest).
<p> I trust you passed along all of our thoughts and thanks to our brothers and sisters in line with you.  We may not have been there in person, but definitely there in spirit.
<p> Everytime I see an especially good takedown on Yahoo, I know you're behind it. Boy, you've had some good ones lately!
<p> I know it's you when I see the trails of blood left from dragging their decapitiated heads back to the cave for mounting on your trophy wall. Somebody better mop up that place, it's a mess...
<p> I don't know details of what happened, obviously, but two years ago the republicans in Idaho took a huge ax to medicaid and medicare (as well as everything else that helps poor people) and it had devastating effects on a lot of people.
<p> Conveniently enough, most people blamed Obamacare for that, and you KNOW republicans had this in mind when they did that.
<p> The PURPOSE of "partial hospital" is to keep people OUT of the EXPENSIVE hospital.
<p> At the previous rate a program like mine is approximately 25% of the cost for just sitting on the bed in a hospital. Treatment not included. We are all treatment. Then they go back to where ever they live.
<p> If we would be bought by a hospital, even 20 miles away in another county, just because we would be owned on paper by that hospital - and without changing one damn thing we are doing right now - we'd get back the 50% rate we lost and the owning hospital would reap something like $800K/year without lifting a finger.
<p> it makes no sense and is counter-productive, we have to jack up census to keep ahead of just breaking even.
<p> Meanwhile, Medicare is threatening hospitals who don't keep people long enough to have them REALLY get well and will be fining them for multiple readmission. The population I work with is DEFINED by multiple re-admissions and we strive to curtail that, but the overall system is simply broken.
<p> Killing programs like this is like throwing out the baby and keeping just the bath water.
<p> Typical healthcare conduct in my 30 years of experience.
<p> And jobs suffer as much as patient care and everybody - but politicians - loses.
<p> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
<p> I've lived with a spouse who has worked in hospital administration for 40 years and even knew many of her professors and graduate school colleagues.  I've never heard of a "partial hospital" in all of that time.
<p> Does your facility specialize in outpatient care, which most health care viewpoints favor these days?  Medicare wants to keep patients out of tertiary care hospitals, with their expensive overheads associated with teaching and expensive facilities.  Just being a "doc in a box" and providing secondary and tertiary care doesn't make it less expensive for Medicare.  All that Medicare seems to have done in this case is to have eliminated that portion of the diagnosis code associated with the overhead portions of the reimbursement, which the physicians in the practice aren't providing anyway.  It was a bonus, which Medicare will no longer provide.
<p> Medicare has been wrestling with these issues ever since the concept of diagnostic related groups started thirty years ago.  The reimbursement rates have been slated to decline whether "Obamacare" got passed or not.  Laying the blame on the ACA reveals the bias of the speaker and their ignorance simultaneously.
<p> We serve primarily a very severe/chronic mentally ill population, not in need of confinement but unable to reside in the community without substantial additional supports.
<p> And since we have been emptying the state hospitals we have a huge number of people who meet criteria in the area.
<p> The  thing has been shifting the cost of who's paying to keep them out of the hospital, and this sort of program does it reasonably well within certain conditions.
<p> We can't alleviate the abject poverty in which these people live; we can't get rid of abusive/neglectful/exploitive  personal care homes that prey on this population, invariably screwing up their treatment, causing relapse and return to the more expensive hospital.
<p> We have doctor and a psych nurse practitioner who get people's meds straight and we do our level best to get them stable before we discharge them to community services which are thin and inconsistent.
<p> Cutting our reimbursement for this really helps.
<p> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
<p> Everything you've written would seem to indicate that your agency is not providing what would be considered hospital care.  I agree that it's medical care which is necessary and less expensive than full in-patient hospitalization, but it doesn't sound like hospital care.  That alone would suggest the reason for the change in classification.
<p> Why doesn't your management agree to being purchased by a hospital in your city?  Has any hospital made an offer to acquire?  Would it be possible to arrange some sort of management arrangement less than acquisition which would qualify your agency for the higher reimbursement rate?  Has anyone approached the Congressional representation in your district to discuss the issue?  I sympathize with the problems the situation has caused, but I'm not sure we know enough about the details to understand fully just what needs to be done to ameliorate it.
<p> Obamacare was voted in, and presto there was an ax to Medicare and Medicaid. Of course, it was Obamacare's fault, because as everyone knows, the government works like lightning especially with something as complex as Medicare and Medicaid.  Not. Unfortunately, quite a few people will believe what they're force fed, and being force fed crap from the increasingly loony and certifiably mendacious RW is resulting in lots of people getting the absolute wrong information.
<p> The whole nation is in an uproar because Obamacare passed and the media painted it as a government takeover of healthcare, and shortly after, citizens across Idaho were cut off from services they had previously relied upon.
<p> One of the people that I had to explain this to was my own sister. One of the worst cuts was taking non-emergency dental coverage out of medicaid. Obamacare passed and shortly after, she lost her dental coverage. And I'll just say that when she found about the cut, she was never disabused of that idea.
<p> So for months, every time she had a toothache (which was often), she was pissed at Obama.
<p> And I'm glad that she mentioned it so that I could explain what happened, but there are thousands of other people who were never told the truth and probably still believe that.
<p> You are not shy. If you REALLY weren't voting Obama, I don't doubt you'd say so. But the title was pretty clear. :)
<p> I won't vote for Obama on November 6, either. Of course I already voted.
<p> And I think I talked my Daughter in IA to vote early. Yesterday we spoke on the phone and she said she'd vote on 11/6, because it's so easy in her little town. I said yes, it's easy, as long as one kid isn't headed to the ER while the other is going to the doctor... I think she will vote early, too.
<p> And Daughter in MD who has 5 kids and a hurricane named Sandy, I think she'd decided to vote yesterday. I hope I hope I hope... Her life is always chaotic, so taking care of anything early, when possible, is a win.
<p> I won't be voting now. Or any time soon. I don't meet the criteria for early voting in my state, so I will be in line as soon as the polls open on November 6. I sorta like the excitement of election day at the polls.
<p> When he's back, because the refrigerant charge will leak into the atmosphere again, tell him to first find and fix the source of the leak, then recharge it with refrigerant.  If he can.  If he knew his stuff, he would have correctly repaired it the first time.
<p> not enough time before work as blue collar work begins at 6 or 7, and after work people wait hours. The way to keep people from voting is to not have many machines or polling places in poorer precincts, then people won't vote. Mail in has helped Dems immeasurably because we work for employers who won't let us off to vote, and also because Dems have more people on the ground. When a mail in ballot is received, we know it, and work to GOTV somewhere else than that voter.
<p> voted yesterday at the downtown branch of the library. Said they had a line & it took him an hour. I'm voting on the 6th. It will be a cold day in hell (climate change not-with-standing) before this crooked state (FL) does anything smart about pot. T and R!!
<p> It's a cheap salesman come-on, and I don't like it. And I'm surprised here that so many think it's okay to be taken in. They wouldn't like it if they were "baited and switched" with a salesman's pitch with some phony product.  Give me a straight diary title and let me decide straight.
<p> Bait and switch is an inherent aspect of life in America, an essential feature of a profit-uber-alles form of capitalism we are subjected to here as well as an inherent feature of politics, where candidates say whatever to get your vote then may or may not even remember all the things they promised.
<p> I was going to offer $5 million to Obama to release his iPod playlist, but some idiot with ugly hair beat me to it.
<p> So I had to think of another way to attract attention to myself.
<p> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
<p> We have all mail-in ballots here in Washington. Should be that way everywhere. I hear we're expecting 80% turn-out.
<p> Voted straight ticket, except for Lieutenant Governor, where we have had a very bad Democrat in there for years. Republicans have a very good pro-choice, pro-environment candidate up. The only way to get a good Dem in there is to start with a good Republican.
<p> People wish to be settled, only as far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them. - Emerson
<p> I said that it was because it encourages them, and having won city council, they set their sight on greater things, and I don' t want to encourage a Republican to run for office, period.
<p> If it were merely a case of two rational parties, then I might. But it's not, and apparently won' t be for a while. If Good Ol' Jimmy were really anything like good....he'd be on the Democratic ticket.
<p> Sociopaths and the ignorant...that's all that remains in the Republican party.
<p> When you come to find how essential the comfort of a well-kept home is to the bodily strength and good conditions, to a sound mind and spirit, and useful days, you will reverence the good housekeeper as I do above artist or poet, beauty or genius.
<p> I spent a nice afternoon out on a farm owned by a rich doctor. He saw my "Doing My Part To Piss OFF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT" bumper sticker and said, Only an Obama loving liberal would have that on their car.
<p> I shot back, "Only a conservative extremist would comment on it; care to dance?" (Meaning, want to talk turkey?)
<p> Shortly after, his trophy wife appeared. I shouldn't call her that. Yes; cute... but also very kind and educated. He's a plastic surgeon; she' an ER RN.
<p> She witnessed our "dance" of discussions and soon, I found she was taking up many points I was making.
<p> When it came to Obamacare, I mentioned 60 million more folks were covered as a result... what doctor doesn't want more patients that can afford healthcare?
<p> His reply staggered me and his wife, "Some of them don't deserve it."
<p> She stomped off... I just stood and stared at him the rest of the day.
<p> "Arrogance is ignorance matured".
<p> What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness, Anger, discontent and drooping hopes... Life is too strong for you-- It takes life to love Life
<p> I guess I never did idealize the man. He always was just a politician to me, he never was Jesus Christ. So, though he's been far from perfect as president, he hasn't disappointed me so badly I hope he doesn't get another term. I'll tell you what he's been: a competent, masterful politician. The victories on his watch, jaw-droppers, just keep piling up. HCR (only the first step, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise), the stimulus, Lilly Ledbetter, new regulations on banks. I could go on.
<p> I've voted for Obama a second time--no problem.
<p> It's here they got the range/ and the machinery for change/ and it's here they got the spiritual thirst. --Leonard Cohen
<p> I know the noble, unselfish thought is that I should be encouraging everyone to vote, whatever their choice. Principles are not supposed to mean you get everything the way you want them, because higher ideas may be infallible but humans are not.
<p> But I also think that voting is too important to be done based on half-assed reasoning and/or willful ignorance. People who vote for Romney because: they think maybe a different guy will be better; managing a business, any business, is the same as managing government; they think all politicians are exactly the same; they can't understand long term consequences of short term actions; or they are so mad at Obama that they basically cut off their own nose to spite their face, make me so much madder than Racists. At least they are voting on their honest, if completely baseless, belief that (any) White man should be POTUS before a Black man. Or fundies who believe that their interpretation of God should reign about any other societal system. I know what I'm dealing with then - people who let fear and their own inadequacies rule their lives. (And if they don't vote either, I won't argue with them.)
<p> But when supposedly intelligent people who do actually have core principles that are more moderate or progressive actually think that voting for Romney won't be so bad, I want to scream "if you can't be bothered to understand and think critically about the candidates, why do you bother to vote?". They are simply not paying attention! And I hope they aren't paying attention to voting dates either.
<p> I can't vote until election day. My daughter wants to go to the actual polling place THAT DAY to vote for President Obama. Symbolism, I guess, but as long as she wants to vote, who cares when it happens.
<p> I have no doubt they will let us vote, and we have all the proper ID, but I'd like to have gotten it over with already myself.
<p> GOTV!
<p> "The difference between the right word and the almost-right word is like the difference between lightning and the lightning bug." -- Mark Twain
<p> us Obamabots.  I voted last week - straight Democratic ticket. I went through my training session last week too - to be an elections officer on Nov. 6th.  I'll be the designated Democratic representatives in any disputes which may arise that require a representative of each party to be present to resolve issues or complaints.  I'm going to be especially watchful of the observers and challengers that may show up to maybe cause a little trouble.  I always feel good about being a part of this very important citizen role in running our democracy.

<p> is Tuesday and so we will be at the polls at 7:00 AM. My daughter in college voted absentee ballot last week. We will proudly vote for the President, Senator Nelson and Alan Grayson. Would have preferred to have picked my daughter up and bring her home to vote but her class schedule is heavy and we voted together in the primary in August. Watching your child cast her first vote is one of the great joys of being a parent.
<p> "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."........ "The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little." (yeah, same guy.)
<p> I commented once to my dialysis technician that the medical field is the only one where doctors, especially interns, have traditionally been expected to work double and even triple shifts. For decades and decades.
<p> So the fact that the candidates are murderous sociopaths who use superficial charm, a seemingly authentic approximation of a human conscience, and a constant barrage of lies to attain their only real goals of power and glory is perfectly acceptable.  Why, because you think that the consequence of a byzantine system of medical laws will produce a net positive gain.
<p> Thanks for the entertaining story.  I knew what was going on, but I wanted to read what you wrote....very good!
<p> Couldn't believe the lines, but we got there early and got it done.  When we left, the line was out into the street, which is about 1/2 a block away.  I tried to take a pic, but then my camera crapped out and I couldn't get the shot, but everyone was so thrilled to be able to do this.  I didn't talk to ONE SINGLE person who was voting for Mittens, and this is in South Miami Dade, FL.  I thoroughly enjoyed talking to the people on line, laughing and sharing.  It was great!
<p> OBAMA 2012!!!!!
<p> Oh, and I forgot I could have taken a pic with my phone, but not being technological adept, I didn't even think about it!  Sorry!  Guess you'll just have to trust me....and no, I am no kin to Mittens!....LOL
<p> As my friend said," I am not renting out space in my head to anybody."
<p> his penchant for the extra-judicial assassination of american citizens and foreign nationals around the world. ill be leaving the presidential spot on my ballot empty. nothing i can do about it. there is no amount of lesser-of-two evils, and no schism in social policies big enough for me to hold my nose on something like that.
<p> by absentee ballot in Wisconsin.  My husband lives in Massachusetts, but we decided that Tammy Baldwin needed his vote more than Elizabeth Warren, so while he was home for the weekend, he contacted our Township Clerk about picking up an absentee ballot to save her a stamp.  She invited him over to actually fill out the ballot in her dining room and save himself a stamp, too, and then asked if I was also interested in voting absentee.  Of course I was!
<p> You never know when something is going to come up, so we took advantage of the offer and have been very unstressed about our votes for almost a month now.
<p> Everyone here has mail in ballots.  Love it.  No lines......but I would wait in line all day & into the night so I could vote for my President & for same sex marriage & for the legalization of marijuana.
<p> a great deal this weekend on the upcoming Presidential election.  He started talking about the difference in his total income (he makes over 300,000 in base salary and that doesn't count dividends, bonuses, etc.) if some or part of the Bush tax cuts are eliminated.  I finally just said that even if he had to accept a slight decrease in his pay if that happened it would be worth it if millions of people didn't go without health insurance.  I am tired of the self centered and I am going to say so from now on.
