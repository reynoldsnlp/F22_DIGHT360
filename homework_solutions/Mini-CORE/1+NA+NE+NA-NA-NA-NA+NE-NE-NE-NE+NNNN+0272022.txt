<h> Walk of life
<h> BRAVE Chris McCullough Young is walking PENNILESS around the UK coastline... to raise awareness of the mental health issues that have blighted his life for over 40 years.
<p> The epic journey will cover 6,000 miles and take two years -- and Chris is relying purely on the kindness of others to survive.
<p> The 47-year-old, who has self-harmed and battled depression, is determined to fight the stigma of mental illness after his recurring psychiatric problems forced him out of his job as a senior social worker.
<p> He's blogging about the extraordinary trek and hopes it will raise funds for charities MIND and the Child Bereavement Charity.
<p> Chris -- who started his incredible journey from his home in Edinburgh on April 6 last year -- said: "I've lived on the brink all my life so I thought I might as well walk round the edge of Britain.
<p> "Since I started, I've been amazed and uplifted by how kind people of this country really are.
<p> "On day one, I was crossing the Forth Road Bridge and the first person I met and told my story to gave me 10 and directed me to the hotel to buy myself dinner.
<p> "At the hotel, I told the staff my plans and I didn't have to pay for my meal.
<p> "I look like a scary bouncer yet people have been happy to take me into their homes for a night.
<p> Site for sore eyes ... Chris enjoys a pint before turning in
<p> Stuart Nimmo
<p> "There was one woman I met early on in Inverkeithing. I asked her 'What makes you trust a big, bald guy in a kilt into your home with your family?'.
<p> "And she insisted, 'I just trust my first impressions of people'."
<p> Chris walks between six and 27 miles a day and is currently making his way through Dumfriesshire having walked the east coast and across the north of Scotland.
<p> Travelling with the trusty trolley he calls Hubert, he only carries basic supplies including a tent and mobile phone batteries.
<p> "But I've still not used it and have been relying totally on the kindness of others." Chris' coastline challenge has helped restore his faith in society.
<p> He said: "People's generosity is overwhelming.
<p> "I got to a place called the Applecross Inn, in Wester Ross.
<p> "I walked in bedraggled after days without a bath but after I explained my story, the proprietor Judy offered me a night's stay for free, her husband cooked me dinner and they held a whip-round for me in the bar that raised 130.
<p> Five a day ... Chris, who is sleeping in a tent, is getting by on donations from kind well-wishers
<p> Stuart Nimmo
<p> "That's just one example of the kindness I've been shown."
<p> He added: "In Crimond, a guy invited me to camp in his garden. He gave me tea then breakfast then went off to work.
<p> "I then realised I was closer to his neighbour's door than to his.
<p> "When his elderly neighbour stuck her head out of the door, I thought she looked angry so I started making excuses as to why I was camping next to her house.
<p> "But she said, 'I'm not interested in any of that -- I've run you a bath. I just wanted to know if you wanted bubbles in it'."
<p> Troubled Chris has suffered mental health problems almost all of his life. His mother died of cervical cancer when he was 12 leaving his alcoholic dad unable to cope.
<p> He was sexually abused at this time by a female relative supposed to be helping the family.
<p> Chris believes these traumas triggered his mental illness. He says: "I carried so much guilt over the sexual abuse. And with my dad already unable to cope with my mum's death, it was a secret I had to deal with on my own.
<p> "I was so depressed and I took the frustration out on other kids at school by beating them up.
<p> "I must have been 13 when I started self-harming a lot. It was just a release and stopped me thinking about everything that was happening. I remember the first time I used this comb that had a metal pointed handle and I just pushed it through my forearm.
<p> "It felt like the pain was an escape. Your emotions go away. I've self-harmed all my life.
<p> "I've punched myself in the face so hard that I've knocked myself out."
<p> Tormented Chris struggled with depression for years before finally being diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder five years ago.
<p> He lost his job, his marriage and the dad-of-two hasn't seen his 21-year-old son or teenage daughter since.
<p> He said: "I hope to get them back in my life one day again.
<p> "I met my partner Ella four years ago and she describes my illness like being The Time Traveller's Wife. Things are fine then suddenly I'm gone then I'm back.
<p> "One in four people suffer mental illness at some stage but there is still such a stigma.
<p> "I found that when my colleagues knew I suffered depression, most were supportive.
<p> "But when I bumped into a girl I used to work with and told her I'd been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder, I saw her backing away and making excuses to get away from me.
<p> "People sometimes walk on eggshells around you when they know you are mentally ill -- but we like a laugh like any normal person."
<p> Chris' walk has been halted a few times by his illness and he relies on Ella, 46, to help.
<p> He said: "Ella calls me three times a day and she can tell if I'm losing it. If it's going wrong, she just orders me to the nearest B&B and comes to get me.
<p> "July was a washout as I had episode after episode and we've agreed I should take a break every two weeks."
<p> Despite being on the road alone, the most dangerous thing Chris has encountered is TICKS.
<p> He laughed: "I was walking through a field up near Cormarty and about 100 ticks saw me as a good meal. And I've been attacked by midges.
