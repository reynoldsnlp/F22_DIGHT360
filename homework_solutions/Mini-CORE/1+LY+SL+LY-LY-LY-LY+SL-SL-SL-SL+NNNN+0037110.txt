<h> Gonna Be A Long Time Lyrics - John Butler Trio
<p> (All tryin to find our way.) Well everybody's lookin for something they can't find, Walking straight ahead blind folded production line, Only taking time for one type of shoe shine. Don't look left/right now you got a street fine. Everybody lookin for just a little more. Working late nights trying to fight off the day glow. Waiting for the come-around but it is a no show. Driving in the fast lane lookin for the slow-mo...
<p> Oh what's in store I don't know anymore. Oh what's inside 'cos I can't hide from it now more. Oh what you see well it's not me anymore, yeah. Oh I don't know well I don't know man anymore Because I tell you once, I tell you twice, it's gonna be a long time But you don't take no ones advice, it's gonna be a long time you, Where were you, you weren't listenin, gonna be a long time
<p> Gonna be a long time.
<p> So now your face down, face lookin like a frying pan. Hitting up the clubs trying to feel like a real man. Beating your chest just like you're king kong but you're just a gui-tar no-string no-song. Feeling free like ya don't even know it, man you're towing the line hoping you just don't blow it. Man ya stuck in the mainframe trying to win the big game so much potential it even makes it more of a shame, shame, shame. Here we go again, same old shit just another name. Looking at the destiny there in your palm, But now you got your strings but you got no song. So sing, sing, sing - shake it like a chicken wing. It's not what you get it's about what you bring-bring-bring. So bring it, bring it to the table, not because you have to 'cos you're willing and you're able!
<p> Oh what's in store I don't know anymore. Oh what's inside 'cos I can't hide from it no more, yeah. Oh what you see, well it's not me anymore. Oh I don't know, I don't know anymore because I tell you once, I tell you twice, it's gonna be a long time. But you don't take no one's advice, it's gonna be a long time. You, where were you, you weren't listening, gonna be a long time.
