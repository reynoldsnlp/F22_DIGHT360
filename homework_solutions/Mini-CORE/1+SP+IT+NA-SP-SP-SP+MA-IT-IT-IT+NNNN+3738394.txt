<h> Testament -- Alex Skolnick
<p> Testament are one of the pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene. After nine successful albums since the 80?s, the band are set to release their tenth studio album titled 'Dark Roots of Earth' in just a few days from now. A couple of weeks ago, Testament's guitarist Alex Skolnick had a chat to Metal Obsession about their new album, his departure from the band from 1993-2005 and Randy Blythe.
<p> Metal Obsession: Your tenth studio album 'Dark Roots of Earth' will be released very soon. I'd presume that you're excited for it?
<p> Alex Skolnick: I'm excited and relieved.
<p> Metal Obsession: Why relieved?
<p> Alex: Let me tell you straight out; a lot of work goes into these things. So it's just a huge relief to have it out.
<p> Metal Obsession: Do you feel that this album is your best work yet?
<p> Alex: I think so. I think it's the most diverse album, and I also think it has the least amount of repetition, and the most variety. Our new album should have something for everybody.
<p> Metal Obsession: The other guitarist, Eric Peterson stated in an interview that the band wanted to play more melodic rock. While the album remained more on the thrash side, you did get the chance to throw some melodic stuff in. Who was it that was more influenced by melodic rock?
<p> Alex: Well I guess that's a strange way to put it; 'melodic rock stuff' . I always want my music to be musically interesting. I like it to have a sense of harmony, and a sense of melody, so a little bit of sophistication. So if that qualifies as melodic rock stuff, then I suppose I'm guilty. *laughs*
<p> But I think that Chuck was also more interested in really using his voice and singing melodies. As you know, Chuck has a few different styles. He has his classic style, he has his 90?s death metal style. He's able to do both, and I think he wanted to rest the death metal vocals on this album, and explore more of the melodic range.
<p> Metal Obsession: That's what I was thinking. Because I could hear a lot more of the death metal vocals on your last album, The Formation of Damnation . I thought this album would be the same before I listened to it.
<p> Alex: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he wanted to do less of that.
<p> Metal Obsession: What's the current situation of the Testament drummer -- Is Gene Hoglan an official member of the band, or did he just help out with the new album and touring?
<p> Alex: I think things are different now than they used to be. I mean, album cycles last longer, bands in general don't release albums as often as they used to. Even the younger bands. So, this is no longer a younger band, AND it's just a period where albums don't happen as often as they used to.
<p> But you know, in the early 90?s, you could call someone a permanent member, then there'd be an album coming out every year or every two years with the same members. But now, this album will have came out... 3 years since the last one? Actually, 4 years ago. It came out in 2008. In the old days, even legendary bands wouldn't last that long.
<p> So for this album, yes; Gene Hoglan is the main drummer. He probably won't be at every show, because there will be occasional events on. He has some other commitments, especially Dethklok . But I know that most of the shows, he's going to be there. He's the first call guy. He's the guy on the album, the guy in the photographs, so he isn't so much the permanent drummer, but he's definitely the first call drummer.
<p> Metal Obsession: So you're at your tenth studio album now. How many more do you think you will do?
<p> Alex: It's really hard to say! When we did the reunion, it was unclear that we were going to do an album, and then it became clear, like "Yeah okay, we'll do an album!" Then with this album, it was talked about, it was reflected upon, then we decided that yes, we're going to do this album.
<p> But yeah, we really can't say. A couple of years ago, I don't think any of us would have predicted that there'd be two new studio albums.
<p> Metal Obsession: You took a 12 year break from Testament from 1993 to 2005. What was the reason behind leaving the band, and what made you want to come back?
<p> Alex: There were a lot of reasons, man. The main reason for me was that I consider myself a diverse musician. I spent just about all of my time out of the band building up my guitar techniques, and I appreciated many different styles of music. So I thought, why not do whatever I can do be a diverse musician?
<p> I had already been studying other styles of music, I knew I eventually wanted to do more jazz and funk music. It just got to the point where I really needed to focus on that full time. But to be completely honest, it was a little difficult to be in the band at that time. The original drummer also left the band shortly after I did. It's very rare for someone to last more than one record, other than the original line-up.
<p> But when I came back, I was ready to play metal again. Not just metal again, but... I knew eventually I was going to play metal again as well as continue my other styles. So I did, and I was trying to think of the right project. It was right around that time that I got a call from the guys from Testament, saying that they wanted to do this reunion. The reunion tour lead to an album, then that album lead to more tours, and it's been a nice little ride ever since. And now it's almost lasted longer than I was in the band the first time.
<p> Metal Obsession: Is there any chance of Testament making a festival appearance or doing a headline tour in Australia soon?
<p> Alex: Ah, I don't know about soon, we're pretty booked out with North American tours at the moment. But I think that next year is a very good chance of an Australian tour. I expect to see that in 2013.
<p> Metal Obsession: Do you have any favourite bands from down here in Australia?
<p> Alex: Yes I do. Obviously the big one would be AC/DC . But last time I was there, I got turned on to a lot of the bands from the scene that AC/DC came from, like Rose Tattoo , and some of these other bands that I really wasn't aware of. The whole 'pub rock' thing was really cool. I also don't know how well the band Wolfmother is thought of over there, supposedly some people think of them as hipster metal. But I think the direction is really good, I quite enjoy them.
<p> Metal Obsession: How about any thrash bands from Australia, do you know many?
<p> Alex: I remember some of the bands that have been on the bill when we played Australia, and they were really good. But yeah, I need to be turned onto more of them!
<p> Metal Obsession: How about your favourite band from the Bay Area, where you came from -- Whether it's just a local band or a big band that you've toured with over the years, who's your favourite?
<p> Alex: From the Bay Area? That's hard to say, but probably Death Angel . I think that they're a favourite of many of us.
<p> Metal Obsession: As I'm sure you're aware, the big news in the metal world today is Randy Blythe (Lamb of God) being arrested in another country, being charged with manslaughter. What is your view on all of the controversy over the past couple of weeks? Do you support the "Free Randy Blythe" cause?
<p> Alex: I'm honestly in shock about it, actually. Randy is a good friend, and I am very much in shock. He had to spend the night in jail, and for a start that's what it was. Then it turned into a weekend, then it turned into a week, now it's been two weeks, and I think it's outrageous! I think there will be a big backlash until this is resolved. I've been on Twitter trying to get the attention of politicians, media, and so far it's only been covered by local news in Randy's town. It really needs to be covered by the bigger media outlets.
<p> Somebody on Twitter made the point that Justin Bieber recently got a speeding ticket, and that was front page news. And here we have a grammy nominated musician arrested and charged with manslaughter in a different country, and there is no mention.
<p> Metal Obsession: I feel that they're only not covering the news for front page headlines being that he's a metal musician. It's quite unfair really.
<p> Alex: Yeah, I agree. And it's such a shame, because he's not just a metal musician, he's a very reflective and intelligent person. Nobody deserves this treatment, it's just horrifying.
<p> Metal Obsession: Is there anything else that you'd like to say?
<p> Alex: That's it I think. I'll say that I really appreciate all the support from Australia, I can't wait to go back there. I know we'll be seeing everyone from down under very soon!
