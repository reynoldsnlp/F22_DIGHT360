<p> THE Government and the Opposition today are clashing over who "owns" Peter Slipper as the new Speaker faces savage attacks on his character.
<p> And former party colleagues of the man who yesterday defected from the Liberals to take the Speaker's chair joined the attacks.
<p> There were comparisons between him and the man he succeeded, Labor's Harry Jenkins, who had an unblemished reputation.
<p> "I think a lot of people in the Labor Party today are saying, 'we have replaced Harry Jenkins with what?'" Opposition Leader Tony Abbott told the Nine network today.
<p> Meanwhile, Mr Jenkins last night dined with Labor colleagues for the first time in 12 months without fears he would be accused of bias.
<p> The Opposition is furious Mr Slipper has given the minority Government an extra buffer of votes in the House of Representatives and made it more likely Prime Minister Julia Gillard will go a full term until 2013.
<p> The Australian newspaper revived scuttlebutt of a film or video of Mr Slipper and another man. Nothing illegal was being done but the office of Prime Minister John Howard inquired into its existence, the newspaper said.
<p> Mr Slipper was parliamentary secretary to Mr Howard for 18 months to October, 2003 and to the Finance Minister from 1998 to 2004.
<p> Further allegations are expected with the Opposition determined to make the Government responsible for the actions of Mr Slipper when he was a Liberal.
<p> "Peter Slipper was sacked by John Howard from the ministry, the Liberal Party was in the process of removing him from the Liberal Party.
<p> "And Julia Gillard formed the view that he was a man of such fine character that he should be appointed ahead of every other Labor MP to hold the highest parliamentary office in Australia."
<p> A senior Labor figure acknowledged the attacks on Mr Slipper yesterday but said, "he didn't have ALP after his name".
<p> Tony Abbott said: "There's no doubt Peter Slipper has been a problem over the years, but he is now Julia Gillard's problem and she may well find that he is an interesting one.
<p> Labor moved to counter claims Mr Jenkins was forced out of the Speaker's chair to get the extra votes.
<p> Government Whip Joel Fitzgibbon this morning told of how he had dined with Mr Jenkins last night and was convinced he had volunteered to end his four years in the job because of difficulties in the final year of minority Government.
<p> "Harry for a long time aspired to be Speaker of the House of Representatives and was a very, very good Speaker," Mr Fitzgibbon told ABC radio.
<p> "But he had three years in the job as he had anticipated, but the last year of that job required him to walk away from the party he had been a member of for something like 40 years.
<p> "It required him to not participate in the Caucus. It denied him any opportunity to influence public policy debate.
<p> "Indeed it even denied him the opportunity to have dinner with his colleagues during the course of the week for fear of being accused of being too close to one particular party in Parliament.
<p> "That's not the job he took four years ago. It weighed very, very heavily on him. It was his decision, and his decision only."

<p> The reality of all this is that nothing changes. Julia has already managed to get her bad legislation through parliament. All she has done is managed to highlight the poor value systems of several members (including her own). No, this has little impact until the next election and is yet another reason Julia will not see another term.

<p> If Abbott cannot even manage people within his party, how can he expect to manage the nation. We have been lucky to avoid Abbot as PM over the last year. Let's hope the Liberal Party work out how damaging Abbott is and replace him before the next election ... maybe then I will vote for them.
