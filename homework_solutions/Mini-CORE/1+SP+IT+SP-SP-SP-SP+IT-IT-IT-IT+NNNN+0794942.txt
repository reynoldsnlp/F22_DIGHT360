<h> INTERVIEW: We caught up with Russian electro titan Proxy for a very rare interview!
<p> After years of anticipation, Proxy at last presents his debut album, Music From The Eastblock Jungles, part 1 of which is out today, November 5th. The album, released in two parts showcases the prolific underground rave-czar's awe-inspiring body of work. He's amassed a cult following over the last few years despite forging out his sound in complete isolation, with visa problems leading him to entrench himself in the middle of nowhere in his native Russia.
<p> Music From The Eastblock Jungles features over 20 tracks, with Pt.1 opening with the flag-bearing march of 'Raja Ganja' and unhinged breakbeat madness of 'Junk', whilst Pt.2 promises a broad mix, from acid of 'Audio 15? to the ambience to 'Nanomed', taking in influences ranging from Eastern-flavoured pop to hip-hop head-nodders.
<p> We caught up with the man himself for a rare, and typically bizarre interview! Check it out below...
