<h> Do I look like I'm going to rape you?
<p> I'm tired of people thinking I'm going to rape them, rob them, harass them, or all of the above.
<p> I have to drag my ass out of bed every weekday morning, some times as early as 5 a.m., and take the bus to school. Nothing irritates me more than when older people look at me when I get off the bus as if I'm going to follow them and steal their purse. Or if we're walking the same direction, they assume I'm going to follow them to some creepy back alley and rape them.
<p> I know Winnipeg isn't the ideal or safest city to live in, but I'm tired of being profiled because I'm young, and  downtown at an odd time.
<p> My jacket is baggy because I'm a thin kid. I don't always have a perky smile pasted on my face because who does at 6 a.m.? I'm a student and as much as I can use the money, I'm not going to rob you, ma'am.
<p> I'm not saying you've got to trust everyone in the world, I just want to see others toss me a blank stare on the street, instead of a pointless fearful one. Relax, I don't bite.
