<h> Jesus Is Lord Of The Way I Feel lyrics
<h> Don Francisco Jesus Is Lord Of The Way I Feel lyrics
<p> Praise the Lord! Hallelu! I don't care what the devil's gonna do! The Word in faith is my sword and shield, And Jesus is Lord of the way I feel
<p> Tho' the fig tree shall not blossom, 'Tho there be no grapes up on the vine, 'Tho the olive tree shall cast it's fruit and the feild shall yield no grain to grind, 'Tho the flock shall all be scattered and there be no cattle in the stall, The Lord is still my joy and strengh and by His Word He'll change it all [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/don_f\\... ] Praise the Lord! Hallelu! I don't care what the devil's gonna do! The Word in faith is my sword and shield, And Jesus is Lord of the way I feel.
<p> The Spirit of the Lord is here and He has anointed me To tell the news to ev'ry one: He's come to set the captive free! So, if you're broken hearted but tired of all those chains you wear, The Lord is here to heal you now and bring the pow'r that holds you there.
<p> Praise the Lord! Hallelu! I don't care what the devil's gonna do! The Word in faith is my sword and shield, And Jesus is Lord of the way I feel.
