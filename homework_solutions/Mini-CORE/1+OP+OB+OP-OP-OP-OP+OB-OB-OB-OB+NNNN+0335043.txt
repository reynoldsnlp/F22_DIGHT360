<p> Arguably more annoying than when people get cheesesteaks wrong is when they can't even spell "Philly." I guess they can earn some points back with the Artic Splash iced tea carton that I see peeking out in the corner of this photo.
<p> I live in Philly but come from North Jersey/NYC, so I'm no expert. I like my cheesesteaks with provolone and fried onions - that's it. I recently got into a debate with a bunch of my high school students who insist that "real Philadelphians" put ketchup on their cheesesteaks. I vehemently disagree and believe that ketchup is for kids and people who don't like the taste of steak (or eggs, hot dogs, etc.). Who is correct?
<p> Hey, sorry for what's probably an awkwardly late response. But to your question -- 
<p> There's definitely debate on this topic from all parties, native Philadelphians and those who have moved here alike. Speaking for native Philadelphians, I really don't think putting ketchup on a cheesesteak is a really common occurrence. I do it from time to time (when craving ketchup on my cheesesteak for reasons I can't explain) but I honestly don't think it's something that "real Philadelphians" are obligated to do.
<p> On the flipside, I don't feel there's a stigma for putting ketchup on your cheesesteak. Some people think it's not legit to do so but I don't really feel it's a bad thing.
<p> In regards to your statement about ketchup, I can see what you're saying. I like ketchup and I loooove hot sauce but depending on what you add the condiment to, I feel that it enhances the food. Though, it could definitely mask the food with its own flavor.
<p> Shank's on Delaware Ave calls it a "cheesesteak sandwich" for shame, it's the only place I've ever encountered here that does that. Upside: one of the friendliest exchanges I've ever had at a cheesesteak joint.
