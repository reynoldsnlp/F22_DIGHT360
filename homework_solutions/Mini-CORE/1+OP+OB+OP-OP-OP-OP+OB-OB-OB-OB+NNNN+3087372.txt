<h> Polyamory As a Path to Bliss
<p> Why take the risk of being polyamorous when you guys are so happy together?
<p> And my answer is...
<p> Being monogamous is also a risk. And for us at least, a greater one than polyamory.
<p> Monogamy keeps couples together by creating barriers of exit; socially; financially and psychologically. One cannot look at the divorce statistics to ascertain how successful it is; this only proves how many couples remain married. Not how many couples remain happily married... Judging by how many marriages now end in divorce since it became more socially acceptable, that's not many. Nor how many couples are monogamous by law and yet have some element of infidelity within their configuration, be it emotional or physical.
<p> No. In the final analysis, statistics mean very little (and being a financial analyst by trade, I know that underlying motivations for variance can tell a completely different story). I will not prove anything to anyone with statistics.
<p> The point about monogamy only is that it stems from the masculine principle. Control, Management, Strategy. They are all masculine traits. Why do we use them? Because we are a culture who tries to create certainty and boundaries to stem our fear. We are living in a fear based culture. There are examples of it everywhere. As an economy, when Enrons or Barings scandals occur, we immediately look to control any future outcomes by making more rules. More stringent measures...codes of ethics, Sarbanes Oxley, better corporate structures to govern conflicts of interest. Control, Management, Strategy. You could call them mind or ego games.  They take the heart out of operations, create anxiety and -- yes -- temporary reassurance. It won't happen again. Until it does. And this is the everlasting vicious circle. More control, creates more fear, which in turn creates more control.
<p> In society we also create rules, mostly unspoken (unless of course those rules are religion...they're fairly outspoken!). People who go against the norm are excluded. Those people are a threat to our beliefs and a veiled insult to the way that we live our lives. Many prefer to live in their comfort zone, unwilling or unable to take on the challenge of life. They are not ready. The challenge life is of course, growth. Development. A commitment to better awareness and honesty. It involves pain, yes. But only as far as breakdown...and breakthrough.
<p> Polyamory is a feminine paradigm and a process*. It is a belief, in the possibility of our ability to love many. It is a methodology by with you can constantly re-evaluate if your relationships are serving you. It is a concept which embodies our universal needs of Love, Freedom, Connection and Honesty. It is the antithesis of control. It is complete trust. Not -- I hasten to add -- in the other person. That puts far too heavy a burden on your relationship. To trust someone with one's own happiness is abusive to the other person. To trust someone 'not to hurt you' gives them a power and a responsibility which is yours. The Trust involves the trust in yourself as a microcosm of the universe. The Trust that you are open to what it brings you. The Trust that you can cope. The Trust that you will always be okay...because it is your choice to be okay.
<p> Many who choose polyamory start along the path of openness and trust. Then somewhere, someway down the line they create rules again for themselves. They impose hierarchy on it. Primary partners, secondary partners, tertiary partners. Hierarchy yet again is a masculine principle. They ask for prioritization (I know because I am not immune to this myself). It is so easy to slip back into our familiar control patterns. For anyone new coming into our relationship, it is difficult to understand.
<p> They ask
<p> 'Where would this relationship lead?' (It must lead somewhere  to a climax, a goal)
<p> Nowhere. And everywhere. Where does any friendship lead? To happiness. To knowledge. Probably not to living together and children**. But never say never. So programmed are we into an imposed relationship structure (masculine paradigm) of 'my prince will come and we will live happily ever after', 'he will be my everything and satisfy every need' (what a huge burden on someone!), that we cannot envisage exploring a connection, just because there is one. The safety of unthinking, unconscious monogamy creates a perception of comfort where there is none. It dulls the senses. It wraps us in cotton wool. Where we remain fetally stunted, soft and shielded. From growth. And that for me is a far bigger risk. A risk of wasting your life (who knows if it's the only one we get).
<p> We are a society who has mistaken happiness, for comfort. If you seek to be happy, do not, in the short term at least, seek to be comfortable. Because there are many battles to be fought if you are to find your truth. And I tell you, knowing, feeling and living your truth...is the ultimate state of bliss.
<p> *A feminine paradigm is characterised by a more spherical way of thinking as opposed to a linear viewpoint of the masculine paradigm which is about achievement, climax and winning.  How we think about things, our paradigm, largely governs our experience.  Where we think in terms of winning and losing, we will always be bound by this outcome. When we think in cyclical terms it means our experience is not finite 'winning/losing' journey with a start and endpoint, but something which allows a deep introspection. A journey 'into the whirlpool of our soul'. A journey within ourselves to uncover layer by layer, our innate wisdom. Polyamory is one such paradigm, but not of course, the only one.
<p> **NB. polyamorous relationships currently tend to have more stability after basic biology has been satisfied. If you are no longer looking for a partner with whom to have children then you are free to create connection without any underlying biological need. If we lived in a free thinking society where a structure supported multiple relationships those children involved this would be less of an issue.
<p> Clearly this site is all about me. But it's also about you. Anything that you've been too ashamed to speak about, may be holding you back and causing you internalized pain. Rest assured, this pain comes out one way or another; and many times in a destructive manner. I hope my honesty inspires you to face up to your shame - because you doing so, you may well get rid of it forever. Now that's what I call shameless!
