<h> Sleep A Little Less, Dream A Little More lyrics
<h> Mdc Sleep A Little Less, Dream A Little More lyrics
<p> Hey get out of your bed You're acting like a bore Everything's a mess Play it more hardcore Don't be playing dead We can hear you snore Sleep a little less and Dream a little more
<p> We're all in a bind It ain't so fucking fine Get up and start moving 'Cause now is the time. [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/mdc/s\\... ] Get it to the groove And start to bust a move Better shake your ass You've got nothing to lose Shit's running low It's all out fucking war Time to sleep a little less Dream a little more
<p> So what you gonna' do It's up to fucking you Time to make a stand And a freaking plan Backs up to the wall We are all kinda' sore Time to sleep a little less Dream a little more
