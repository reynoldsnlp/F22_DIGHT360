<h> Environmental Extremists vs. Ecological Ignorance
<p> It is interesting to note the number of aggressive presentations I have sat through recently at some agri conferences.
<p> These conferences attract a lot of people and a lot of talking. Amongst the attendees there always seem to be plenty of experienced investment bankers who have become agriculture experts in a remarkably short period of time which I find fascinating. In fact I can't tell you how fascinating my farming friends in NZ find that.
<p> Those individuals that do seem to know about agriculture at conferences largely come from the world of what might be termed 'Big Ag' or Industrial Ag. These guys tend to be very bullish, aggressive, intolerant of anything outside their view and antagonistic towards 'environmental concerns'. The latter point is almost at the frothing at the mouth level of intensity and they have developed their own little phrase to deal with such matters. The favoured phrase of the moment is 'Environmental Extremists' -- fantastic; conjures up images of Hollywood action films or people that my Herefordshire based army mates might be forced to contend with.
<p> Apparently these 'Environmental Extremists' will attempt to derail and get in the way of agricultural advancement -- which is nothing more than code for the same old failed practices and vested interests.
<p> This is all part of that 'obliterate the environment to feed the world' thing. This thinking (if it can be referred to as such) is scientifically insane, transparently self-defeating and would be laughable in its stupidity if it weren't so tragic in its consequences.
<p> The ignorance of and intolerance towards the science of ecology and its application in an agricultural context never ceases to amaze me.
<p> The irony is this is not entirely without its positive aspects -- what? I hear you say. The reality is that antagonism towards and ignorance of ecological science in agricultural management and practice will cause investments to at best underperform and certainly be over represented amongst the lists of failures. This of course provides the opportunity for those scientifically competent, aware and resilient strategies to be ever more demonstrably superior in terms of their financial and environmental performance.
<p> The financial and environmental performance are of course one in the same although that could be described as an environmentally extremist view.
<p> A potential challenge for investors is not 'Environmental Extremists' or even the Big Ag 'tough guys' but the lack of scientific knowledge, agroecological knowledge, amongst farmland investment managers. That is because such knowledge takes time, application and very specific study to achieve. Even achieving the required study is difficult as relevant and sufficiently resourced (financial and intellectual) courses/programmes are not widely available.
<p> Investors who therefore understand these issues must actively back those managers who do have the knowledge, the experience and the insight. They will be well rewarded by the inevitable movement of resource depletion, climate change and the positive outcomes generated through the application of superior agroecological knowledge and experience.
<p> The simple reality that seemingly escapes many is that ecological and environmental failure in farmland investment equates to financial failure.

<p> Fine comment Geoff. The challenge of "feeding the world" ecologically by spreading smallholder sustainable practices and then scaling up commercially remains immense, with a vast lack of knowledge all the way from investors, advisors, managers, NGOs, governments, traders, farmers.
