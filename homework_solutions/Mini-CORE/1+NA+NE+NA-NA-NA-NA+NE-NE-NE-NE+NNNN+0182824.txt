<p> Where have all the children gone? Ciudad Vadeluz led the property boom in Europe. The global economic slump has taken its toll, however, and now it comprises a landscape of deserted streets and empty spaces
<p> Boulevard of broken dreams: Ciudad Valdeluz was supposed to house 30,000 people. Barely 1000 now live there
<p> For those who find the silent buildings and empty spaces eerie, there is hope of a new, fast rail link to Madrid that will provide a link to a more populated place
<p> Between 2001 and 2007, Spain was leading the property boom in Europe with prices increasing annually at an average of around 13 per cent.
<p> Then the economic downturn hit in 2008 and much of the housing that was built to take advantage of rising demand now stands empty.
<p> The Spanish government estimates that over 780,000 houses built since 2005 have not been sold.
<p> Work halted on Ciudad Valdeluz in the summer of 2008 and as yet, no date has been set for it to resume leaving 75 per cent of the city unfinished.
<p> Ghost town: Ciudad Valdeluz is the perfect place for those wanting to live a solitary existance
<p> The Spanish government has estimated that over 780,000 houses built since 2005 have not been sold
<p> The city has become a ghost town, characterised by its deserted streets and empty spaces.
<p> Meanwhile, for the few people that live here, there are only basic services: a supermarket, a corner shop and a medical centre open two days a week.
<p> Despite this, a security patrol still watches over the uninhabited houses and unopened shops keeping them safe. A restaurant and pharmacy are due to open soon.
<p> Fenced off: The apartment blocks stand empty on barren land
<p> Ciudad Valdeluz was supposed to offer people an excellent quality of life at a reasonable price
<p> A work in progress? Building work in the city was halted in the summer of 2008 when the economy began to slow. As yet, there has been no news of when work will resume and 75 per cent of the city remains unfinished
<p> For the few people that live in Ciudad Valdeluz, there are only a few basic services including a supermarket, a corner shop and a medical centre
<p> The city is no bustling metropolis yet a 24 hour security patrol keeps the uninhabited and unopened shops safe
<p> For those who enjoy a solitary existence defined by peace and quiet, this could be the perfect place to live.
<p> For the inhabitants stuck here, however, there is hope in the form of a new, fast, rail link to Madrid where they can escape to the city.
<p> No chance of overcrowding here: A huge amount of properties are still for sale
<p> I've been to Spain before, it's a beautiful country, but all over the place is empty apartment blocks and cranes hanging over buildings frozen in construction. The Spanish Government needs to act now and stop building houses no one will buy and actually start selling these!
<p> Its all been planed by the Germans/EU to give Spain Ireland Greece England Etc Cheap Loans euro Loans & they will be forever in Debt to the Germans/EU & IMF. Spain Ireland Greece England Etc will Never get out of the Recession until Europe is FREE & Independent again from the Germans/EU & Mickey Mouse euro Money. But the Muppets (Mr Cameron & Co keep leading England into more problems grovelling to the Germans/EU & giving them Billions of Tax payers s each month. (Mr Ed Labour Lib Dems are just as Bad or Hopeless).
<p> What is not apparent from these photographs of the ghost town is the decay which the apartments are being subject to. Building regulations in Spain are sparse if non-existant,and these edifices have just the basic superstructure. One outer layer of porous brick,no dry-lining or damp courses,so within a short measure of time they will start to crumble. So to state that they are going to re-open in a few years is a bit of an over-statement. They will rot and continue to decay and the people(thank goodness not many Brits fell for the hype)will be trapped in something that the USSR of the 50's would be proud of. And this is just one example of the decay,corruption and downright stupidity of the Spanish authorities. And still they wonder why no-one wants to buy in Spain any more. The paeseta will drop one day.
