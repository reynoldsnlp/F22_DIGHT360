<p> It took one little spritz.. My breath was fresher, mintier, and the taste of cigarettes was absolutely gone. I felt like I was kissing the holy mother herself. I got this strange sensation, waving through my whole body like electricity. Colors became brighter, everything was more vivid. Anything that moved left lingering, blurred trails. And then it happened.. I saw god.. He had long hair and a beard, loose fitting clothing and resembled my hippy roomate. He said "hey man! did you see a little spray bottle full of mint? I've been looking all over for it and I really need to find it now or we'll be late for the Phish concert." I handed it to god, a little hesitantly, who just just smiled and laughed. "Thanks dude, have a nice trip!" He even knew I had a long car ride ahead of me, but of course he did.. What a nice guy!
<p> Is your voice too deep and manly to convince other men that you are indeed gay, and not just some straight guy who's playing a prank? If so, then Instant Gay Accent Breath Spray is for you!
<p> That's right guys! With just a couple quick spritzes of this super fabulous breath spray, your voice will go from Bruce Willis to Richard Simmons in less than 2 seconds! Say "good-bye" to the manly voice that attracts women, and say "heeeeey!" to a new lisp that will drive the boys absolutely wild! You'll never want to leave the house without it!
<p> Having trouble trying to convince your friends that you can decorate your house all by yourself? Just spray a little Instant Gay Accent Breath Spray in that sausage trap of yours and try explaining again! Your friends will never question your sexual preference or decorating abilities ever again!
<p> Not only does this spray make your straight mouth gay, it freshens your breath with real peppermint flavor! Mmmmm. Fabulish!
