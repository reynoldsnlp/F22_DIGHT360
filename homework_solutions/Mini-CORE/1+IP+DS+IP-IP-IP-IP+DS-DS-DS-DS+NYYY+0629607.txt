<h> Editorial Reviews
<p> Not even the staunchest music skeptic expected A Piece of My Passion, Juanita Bynum's third album, to become the gospel smash it did in 2006. The two-disc set topped Billboard's Top Gospel Albums chart for weeks, and it wasn't long until Bynum scored for herself her first gold album. It was an impressive feat no matter how you looked at it: Bynum's day job isn't music, the album was released independently, and there was no blockbuster marketing plan behind it. Instead, the flocks who bought A Piece of My Passion did so based on Bynum's multimedia appeal: she's a self-proclaimed prophetess, best-selling author, speaker, televangelist...and now bona fide contemporary gospel singer. But the thing with Passion is how little of it actually is gospel music. Opener "Break Forth Praise" reminds one of a Sunday morning shout session all right, but from there on out the album takes a dramatic turn. Unexpectedly, Bynum turns into an adult contemporary balladeer, as one song after the next consists of sumptuous, densely orchestrated pop numbers large on sentiment and zeal -- think "Wind Beneath My Wings"-era Bette Midler gone inspirational. Curiously, many of the songs come from unlikely sources, like "Above All Else," a song written by U.K. worship leaderVicky Beeching but attributed mistakenly to CCM-er Rebecca St. James in the liner notes (on a similar note, some songs penned by Hillsong Australia songwriters are credited to Hillsong, not to the songwriters themselves). This adds sloppiness to a set that, while heartfelt, it's ultimately too long and overdone to the point of exhaustion. A Piece of My Passion probably makes for a decent post-conference souvenir for those lining up to see Bynum, but in practice, it's far from being the homerun its chart positioning lets on. ~ Andree Farias, Rovi
<p> Finally, Juanita came out with a new full album. Not only is it a new album, it's a double CD album. It's a nice album for praise, worship, and prayer. It's not prophetic as the other albums but it's still a good album.
<p> This album actually reminds me of Judy Jacobs, mainly because of the two songs "Heart's Desire" and "You Are Great", which was on Judy's album No God Like Jehovah . Even if those two songs weren't on there, it still kind of has that style to it.
<p> This was no mere recording session. God was in the house that night, and Prophetess Bynum was having church. Whoever that Outer Court person was who shamefully called her voice 'mediocre' missed the entire point of the CD...that the music is not there to entertain you. It's there to usher you into the presence of the Holy Spirit, and that's exactly what it does.
<p> I remember "Heart's Desire/You are Great" from Judy Jacobs' CD. Taking nothing away from Ms. Jacobs, the Prophetess did a better rendition of the song(s). The "Wonder Medley", as I call it, was got me on my feet worshipping at 3 AM. "Any Crown" should be a theme song for all Christian artists. "Overflow" was seventeen minutes of unadulterated worship. Phenomenal.
<p> This is what worship is supposed to sound like: passionate, heartfelt, and real. The Prophetess is not about vocal acrobatic nonsense and hitting the highest note. She sings what she means and means what she sings, just like when God uses her to preach. This CD had nothing to do with elevating Juanita and everything to do with elevating the Holy Spirit. It is the best worship CD I have ever heard. And I wouldn't recommend hearing it anywhere you don't feel comfortable shouting.
<p> Juanita has outdone herself this time. This is a CD where you would want to go to that very special place with the Lord - Just you, and Him with Juanita supplying the music. This CD will really move your inner soul to new heights and get the worries of the world off of your back (great for refocusing). My favorites are "Jesus What a Wonder" and "I Don't Mind Waiting" songs. Definitely one to be played to get your worship on !!!
