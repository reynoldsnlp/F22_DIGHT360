<h> Grant: I think the Atlanta Braves would be a good fit for Josh Hamilton
<p> Evan Grant, Rangers beat writer for SportsDayDFW.com and The Dallas Morning News, answered your questions about the team in a live chat on Friday. Here are the highlights.
<p> What would it take to get an Upton or Carlos Gonzalez?
<p> Evan Grant: Putting together trades for all three has crossed my mind. Just not sure Rockies would trade Carlos Gonzalez under any circumstances and I'm not sure I'd want to get tied to Mauer through 2018 at this point. As for either Upton, I think the possibilities are more realistic.
<p> Evan Grant: I can't hit him leadoff next year. I've got to put Andrus there. Kinsler's home and road splits are too wide and he's done nothing over the course of his career to adjust them. I can't have a .230 hitter with a .300 OBP batting leadoff half the time.
<p> Where do you think Hamilton ends up next year?
<p> Evan Grant: Everybody has those concerns. I was thinking Baltimore for a while, but the Orioles really might be set in the OF when Markakis returns next year. I'd still put Atlanta up there. Would be a good fit for him.
