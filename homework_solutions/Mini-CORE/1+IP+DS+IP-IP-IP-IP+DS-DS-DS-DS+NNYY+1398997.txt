<h> And All The Colors... album Product Description
<p> And All The Colors... album by Ian Moore was released Mar 14, 2000 on the Koch International label. The Austin-based rocker's fifth album is notable not only for Moore's ability to balance searing blues guitar and melodic hard rock sensibility, but also for its downright soulfulness. "Room 229" is a smoldering, almost Portishead-like track that finds Moore displaying genuine soul vocal chops And All The Colors... songs. "Magdalena" is the kind of hard rock/soul marriage that Lenny Kravitz occasionally succeeds at, with Moore scraping the top of his vocal range with a sweet falsetto And All The Colors... album. And let's not forget the instrument on which the onetime Joe Ely sideman stakes his reputation And All The Colors... CD music.

This is an album that knows when to rock out and when to back off and plunge the listener into lush atmospherics. ~ Erik Hage

Released in 2002, SO, IT'S LIKE THAT is his second disc, and it provides hints of the heights he'd later hit. Bonamassa is at his best when stretching out, and he doesn't get to do that quite enough here. Still, THAT is good for Bonamassa fans ...
<p> And All The Colors... album This is a Hyper CD which provides a link to the artist's website with the help of an internet browser. Kicking things off with the building title track, Remy Zero makes quite the first impression on The Golden Hum. The momentum keeps up through "Glorious #1," the fast and furious second track, then slows down into a catchy U2-style rocker, "Out/In." That is probably the best point of reference for this band, as many of their songs are similar to Achtung Baby-era U2. It is that brand of moody pop/rock that ...
