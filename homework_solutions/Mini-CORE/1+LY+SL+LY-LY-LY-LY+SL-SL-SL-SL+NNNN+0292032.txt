<h> Death Cab For Cutie Different Names For The Same Thing lyrics
<p> Alone on a train aimless in wonder An outdated map crumbled in my pocket But I didn't care where I was going They're all different names for the same place. [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/death\\... ] The coast just appeared when the sea drown the sun I have no words to share with anyone The boundaries of language are quietly cursed All the different names for the same thing.
<p> There are different names for the same thing There are different names for the same thing...
