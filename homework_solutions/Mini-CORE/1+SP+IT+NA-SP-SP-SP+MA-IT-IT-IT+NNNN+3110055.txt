<p> What would you say is the most important addition that Absolution brings to Hitman?
<p> Christian Elverdam: Well, we worked really hard on this idea that the choice you have in the game was a real choice no matter what you decide. And that meant we had to build a response to everything the player could do. Which is something that's more ambitious than anything in the previous Hitman games.
<p> That means that if you choose to enter a fight, it will be a fully-fledged fight and if you decide to distract the enemy, there will be a lot of different ways that they'll respond to those distractions. Whether they hear a gunshot they will react in one way or if they hear something getting dropped on the ground, they'll react in other ways and then sometimes their guns will be out and sometimes they won't.
<p> We've built the levels so that the player has a choice to take whatever approach they want and that the game would be a whole experience no matter what.
<p> How do you balance creating something new to entice a fresh audience while also retaining the series' hallmarks?
<p> Christian Elverdam: One of the approaches we took when trying to open up the game to more people was to make sure that we were communicating -- what is going on in the game -- a lot more clearly. We felt that the old games had some good stuff in there, but what really fell short sometimes was how we communicated what actually happened.
<p> If you think about it, and when you play Absolution there is a lot of communication to the player, especially vocally from the AI about what they know, where they are going, what they are going to do. Are they getting help, did they see you, do they know who you are, do they buy your disguise?
<p> It sounds simple in a way, but it took a huge effort to make sure we had an AI that was able to express what it is actually thinking and part of that also meant the AI needed to scale. Obviously, an AI in a game always knows everything, but we needed to limit it in a way so that it could spread more organically from person to person, which also fits very well with the fact that if you have a civilian and you pull out your weapon, they will see it and run for help. You will hear them talking to an armed NPC and he'll come to your location.
<p> If you hide, they'll the talk about how they can't find you. You'll constantly be able to gauge roughly where things are headed.
<p> Is there an element of hand-holding in Hitman Absolution?
<p> Christian Elverdam: I actually don't think we have that much hand-holding. It's more in terms of communication. If you think about the Instinct mode, a lot of up-front worries were to do with too much hand-holding. And what we really we feel is that it's another way of showing a map, which means that the player is more engrossed in the environment and we aren't taking you out of the 3D world you're in.
<p> We want to keep players focused and flowing inside the game world. The point is, if you play with Instinct and you try it, you can actually see what it's doing, but on the outside it's very easy to interpret it as some external element, if you will. When you play it, you might be a little bit sceptical at first, but you'll find it's actually a cool mechanic that helps you look at the game.
<p> One of the things we're really happy with in Absolution is the fact that we never force the payer out of the world, you are always inside it and if things screw up a little bit, you're still able to navigate and try to figure out who's coming, where they are, what am I going to do, what do they know. We're constantly keeping you in the flow of the game.
<p> How hard is the hardest difficulty setting?
<p> Christian Elverdam:  In general raw terms, if you take the normal difficulty level for instance, that's much more approachable than ever before, but I also think the Purist difficulty is harder than it has been in any other Hitman. In one way we've broadened the spectrum, but on Purist it's pretty hardcore.
<p> Why not make a standard Deathmatch multiplayer?
<p> Christian Elverdam: We knew we wanted some sort of competitive and social element in the game, but we also didn't want it to feel like it was tacked-on. We took a look at what the community and fans were doing and if you go to YouTube and look at the videos, there are a lot clever ways to kill all the NPCs in the game.
<p> Then we also noticed they were challenging each other to pick other targets than the ones originally intended. They would say 'this guy; can you kill him on Silent Assassin?' Then they would informally challenge each other on the forums and we thought that was a brilliant way to think about it.
<p> Then we'd been talking about this really fundamental thing, that if anyone can be a target it changes the amount of replay value you get out of the game and that's when we knew the basic concept was really strong. But how do we do it then, because we really didn't want a level editor? As I mentioned before, we really wanted players to remain in the game all of the time and from that we worked out this Play To Create, where you create your own contracts.
<p> We thought 'why not just play the game and mark the targets in the game'? Then the game will track what you're doing and that obviously means while you're playing you're aware how fun it's going to be. It's just you showing a friend how you can kill a guy with a hatchet dressed in a chicken suit or it could be a really skilful thing where trying to perform an almost impossible kill or an accident kill or something.
<p> By doing that you're somehow vouching a little bit for the quality of what you're going to share with your friends and on the other hand they know you've already done it. We got rid of the awkwardness you get with a level editor, where you can build  a crazy challenge and not really test it yourself and that means some of the stuff you get can be not that fun. This way you know your friend just completed it so you should be able to do it as well.
<p> Have you had any requests to include some crazy gameplay moments in Absolution?
<p> Christian Elverdam: I don't think this request is actually that crazy, but sometimes we get requests for reactions from the AI. We think it's actually good inspiration, but in terms of where we are right now, some of them are science fiction. But on the other hand that's really nice because it pushes us to think a little bit differently.
<p> Typically, what we get asked to put more detail on everything, that's what the game has been all about. You get these sandboxes and where Hitman games are different to other games is that the detail level in each of these sandboxes is fairly high. Both in terms of their visual density, but also the life of the characters and how much story we can get in there.
<p> Obviously, people always want more.
<p> Have you found development of Absolution under any technical restraints due to the age of the current consoles?
<p> Christian Elverdam: I think we're building high tech entertainment products across the industry and you're always faced with the limitation of platform you're coming out on. At this point it's about squeezing every inch and every little performance out of the consoles.
<p> On the other hand, when the new consoles arrive it's about marking uncharted territory. And it's the same for every developer, we are always -- I wouldn't say fighting -- but working with the restraints of the current systems and trying to expand the restraints of what's possible.
