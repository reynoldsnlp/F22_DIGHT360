<p> Great post Sebastian. I want to add one point: spend time with people who are older and younger than yourself. This would probably constitute family for most people. I can't explain why yet (perhaps it gives us a sense of where we are coming from and going), but occasional interactions with old people and young children always leave me feeling richer. I found these interactions especially lacking when I was working away from home in the U.S.
<p> A brief comment, but I think there's lots of wisdom in that. I'm sitting and reflecting on it for a moment.
<p> I think Raunak is on to something here. You can absorb a lot of wisdom, poise, and maturity from people that have been there before you, and pick up a lot of energy, fun, and spontaneity from kids.
<p> I was in a cafe a few weeks ago and a young kid was going around with his finger like a gun going, "bang! bang!" at people. Most of the adults were ignoring him, but I ducked under the table and put up my finger to shoot back - 'bang! bang!"
<p> Anyway, we got into a little shoot-out, and everyone was laughing and having a nice time. Reflecting on that, interactions with people of different ages... yeah, it's good stuff. Cheers for the comment Raunak, that's worth thinking about.

<p> Heheh, that reminds me of the time when a kid 'shot' me, and I played along, dropping to the ground as if dead. I gave the other adults around quite a fright; apparently, they hadn't noticed the 'shooting', and they thought I'd had a heart attack or something. ;D
<p> I love San Francisco so much that every time I return here from a trip, I resolve to stay for a while and enjoy the city. That never happens. Next week I'm going to Tahoe, then Vegas the following weekend, and then to Austin for SXSW the week after that. Cabo or Hawaii follows in early March, but in late April comes the most exciting upcoming trip: a sixteen day cruise to Rome.
<p> Cruises are full of old people. As best I can tell, that's because young people haven't figured out how awesome and cheap they can be. In fact, I can easily say that of all the travel I've done, cruises probably represent the best bang for the buck.
<p> Before I tell you how to get them cheap, let me tell you why cruises, especially long duration one-way cruises are amazing.
