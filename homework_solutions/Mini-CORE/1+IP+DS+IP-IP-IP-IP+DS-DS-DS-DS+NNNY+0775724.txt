<h> About the Author
<p> Leslie Vernick, a licensed clinical social worker with a private counseling practice, has authored numerous books, including The Emotionally Destructive Relationship and Lord, I Just Want to Be Happy. She completed postgraduate work in biblical counseling and cognitive therapy. Leslie and her husband, Howard, have been married more than 30 years and have two grown children.
<p> I have just finished reading "Lord I Just Want To Be Happy" and have to say that this is well worth the read! Not only worth reading but also putting the skills Leslie Vernick teaches, into ACTION! She guides and encourages us to take the necessary steps in learning how to live a happier life in Christ, by helping us to understand our unhappiness,showing us how to move beyond our unhappiness, and then taking all we've learned and practicing it in order to lead happier lives.
<p> She uses practicle biblical applications and examples in developing these skills and focuses on the fact that true happiness is only found in living our lives for Christ. Though most Christians already know this fact the issue often is how to carry it out, especially in the midst of our hurried, chaotic, and broken lives.
<p> Lord I Just Want To Be Happy is a life changing book for anyone wanting to live a happier life. It helps us to examine our lives in light of God's word and gives a formula for lasting change.
<p> At the end of each chapter are life application questions for thought and discussion, making this book an excellent tool for personal growth or group study.
<p> By the second page of the first chapter my yellow highlighter was busy. As a personal growth book it is the one I will reread and buy more to pass on to many people that are looking for answers to true happiness. Leslie tells us how to live on purpose and not merely exist by giving us tools to fall more deeply in love with Jesus. You learn how to appreciate your life more, practice good self talk, use self discipline, not have unrealistic expectations and many more healthy life practices. Leslie points us away from what the world tries to tell us that will make us happy to the truth that happiness isn't in sinful pleasures but truthful thinking, right relationships, right choices and right living. Because we cannot correct something we cannot see this book will open your eyes to the life Jesus wants you to have and will encourage you to let Jesus transform you. Lord, I Just Want to be Happy should not be the last book you read by Leslie.
