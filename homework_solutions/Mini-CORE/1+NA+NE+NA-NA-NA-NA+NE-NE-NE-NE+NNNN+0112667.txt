<h> Opposition parties see opening to wrest Calgary Centre from Conservatives
<p> Calgary has been painted blue for so long that even Stephen Harper feels safe to skip it come campaign time. Yet NDP leader Thomas Mulcair and interim Liberal leader Bob Rae visited Calgary Centre on Tuesday, with fewer than two weeks to the Nov. 26 by-election. They were preceded by Green leader Elizabeth May, who stopped by to support her party's candidate last week. Before that, Justin Trudeau launched his Liberal leadership campaign here, and Martha Hall Findlay is set to follow suit on Wednesday. That's more federal political activity than this write-off region typically sees in an election year. Is Calgary Centre actually in play? The Post 's Jen Gerson offers four things you should know:
<p> 1. The riding has a history of supporting a redder shade of Tory than is typical in Alberta
<p> Calgary Centre sent its last Liberal to Ottawa in 1968, when it was known as Calgary South. But in 2000, then-PC leader Joe Clark managed to corral enough support to fend off a surging Canadian Alliance. For much of the last decade, Calgary Centre has been served by MP Lee Richardson, another Red Tory who recently stepped down to take a role with Premier Alison Redford's government. Mr. Rae believes that gives a candidate like Liberal Harvey Locke an opening.
<p> "If you go back and look at the history of this riding, it has always chosen someone from the progressive centre, for a long, long time and Harvey is certainly in that position," he said. "The signs are there for us. We've got a lot of positive momentum and it's going to keep coming."
<p> Mr. Rae gave a brief speech to volunteers at Mr. Locke's downtown Calgary headquarters on Tuesday. Although the most recent poll numbers still show Conservative Joan Crockatt with a clear lead, Mr. Locke was visibly giddy at what seemed to be growing support for his bid.
<p> Mr. Rae said: "People are friendly on the street. People are coming over. People are stopping us in coffee shops. People are putting buttons on. People are putting signs up on the lawns in places where, I understand, Liberal signs were not always seen."
<p> Mr. Locke appears to be running a fairly straightforward and thorough campaign in a riding that comprises both the well-to-do neighbourhoods of Mount Royal, and a young, transient, urban population that would most likely vote for a progressive party had it the sense to be situated in any city outside Alberta.
<p> Among this latter tribe, Green Party candidate Chris Turner is emerging as a favourite, clearly hoping to hop a Naheed Nenshi-like wave. As voting day draws closer, the progressive campaigns are turning snippy toward each other, and no clear consensus is emerging as to which lefty to back.
<p> Ms. Crockatt may not win the by-election with the same astonishing 50%-plus majorities that kept Mr. Richardson in power; but with at least two strong progressive campaigns vying for volunteers and support, a split vote and Conservative victory may be inevitable.
<p> 3. Then again, the right-wing is divided too
<p> Of course, even the faint prospect of a progressive win in this riding would have been impossible if the Conservatives hadn't selected such a polarizing figure in the first place. A conservative pundit and commentator, Ms. Crockatt's tacit support of the Wildrose Party in the last provincial election only exacerbated Alberta's conservative rift. Although she supports gay marriage and abortion rights, she has alienated key figures, including the influential Moore family -- traditional Conservatives who have turned to Mr. Locke. Ms. Crockatt said the premier called personally to ask for a Conservative lawn sign, but a picture of Ms. Redford posing with Mr. Locke circulated on Twitter over the weekend.
<p> 4. Never mind the buzz: The Tories will win
<p> "I don't think [the riding] is in play," said Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Mount Royal University. "People want it to be in play. They desperately want it to be in play."
<p> By-elections can be fickle things, with unexpected turnouts. Further, sometimes the electorate can use them to be mischievous, to send a message of dissatisfaction to the governing party without adopting the higher risk of voting in a general election. But Mr. Bratt said voters need to be angrier, the Conservative candidate needs to be less popular, and a consensus needs to emerge around an alternative candidate. None of these things appear to be happening.
<p> "Instead, you have the Liberals fighting the Greens, the Greens fighting the NDP, and the NDP fighting the Liberals. As much as I think people really wish it to be different, it's not," he said.
