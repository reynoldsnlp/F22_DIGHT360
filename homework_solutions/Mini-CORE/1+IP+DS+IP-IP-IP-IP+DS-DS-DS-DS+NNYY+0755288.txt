<h> I Want You To Know Me Book Series
<p> "I want them to know me. Why? They'll know who they are because they are a part of me, and even though years and years will go by, they'll never forget me and we'll always be connected."
<p> Shelly Reklaitis
<p> As cancer ravished her body, a young mother searched for a way her children could still feel connected to her when she was no longer a part of their daily lives and their little memories of her had faded. She wanted a way to connect with them because they would know the many characteristics and personal preferences they shared.
<p> With Shelly as the inspiration, the I Want You To Know Me ... Love, Mom & Dad book was written to make it possible for her and all Moms and Dads to create forever connections with their children.
<p> These unique books elicit simple responses to more than 125 questions that at first appear trivial or unimportant. What we've discovered, however, is the answers are very important when as a whole they become the essence of a loved one and the sparks to ignite cherished memories.
<p> Are you right-handed or left-handed?
<p> What's your favorite smell?
<p> Are you a morning person or a night owl?
<p> Is your second toe longer that your big toe?
<p> Can you roll your R's?
<p> If you have dimples, where are they?
<p> What is your favorite dessert?
<p> Soon requests were flooding in for a similar book for grandparents. A Grandma & Grandpa combined version was introduced along with individual books for Moms, Dads, Grandmas, or Grandpas. "Me" was added for aunts, uncles, step-parents, friends or anyone who wants to connect to someone important in their life.
<p> I Want You to Know Me ... Love, Your American Hero became our eighth and most-treasured edition after a young military wife wanted to make sure her three little boys knew everything about their dad. She wanted to share his answers while he was deployed to keep his memory alive and upon his return they would always know he was a Hero. It is our greatest hope that every U.S. serviceman or woman has the opportunity to complete one of these American Hero books to leave as a lasting legacies for their families.
