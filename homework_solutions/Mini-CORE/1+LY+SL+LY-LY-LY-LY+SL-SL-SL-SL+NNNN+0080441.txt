<h> Wrecking Ball
<p> Marking his 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball features 11 new Springsteen recordings and was produced by Ron Aniello with Bruce Springsteen and executive producer Jon Landau. Said long-time manager Landau, "Bruce has dug down as deep as he can to come up with this vision of modern life. The lyrics tell a story you can't hear anywhere else, and the music is his most innovative of recent years. The writing is some of the best of his career, and both veteran fans and those who are new to Bruce will find much to love on Wrecking Ball ."
<h> Lyrics
<p> I been knocking on the door that holds the throne I been looking for the map that leads me home I been stumbling on good hearts turned to stone The road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone We take care of our own We take care of our own Wherever this flag's flown We take care of our own
<p> From Chicago to New Orleans From the muscle to the bone From the shotgun shack to the Superdome There ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home There ain't no one hearing the bugle blowin' We take care of our own We take care of our own Wherever this flag's flown We take care of our own
<p> Where're the eyes, the eyes with the will to see Where're the hearts that run over with mercy Where's the love that has not forsaken me Where's the work that'll set my hands, my soul free Where's the spirit that'll reign over me Where's the promise from sea to shining sea Where's the promise from sea to shining sea Wherever this flag is flown Wherever this flag is flown Wherever this flag is flown
<p> We take care of our own We take care of our own Wherever this flag's flown We take care of our own
<p> We take care of our own We take care of our own Wherever this flag's flown We take care of our own
<h> Lyrics
<p> You put on your coat, I'll put on my hat You put out the dog, I'll put out the cat You put on your red dress for me tonight honey We're going on the town now Looking for easy money
<p> There's nothing to it mister You won't hear a sound When your whole world comes tumbling down And all them fat cats, they'll just think it's funny I'm goin' on the town now, lookin' for easy money
<p> I got a Smith & Wesson 38 I got a hellfire burning and I got me a date Got me a date on the far shore Where it's bright and sunny I'm goin' on the town tonight, lookin' for easy money
<p> You put on your coat, I'll put on my hat You put out the dog, I'll put out the cat You put on your red dress You're lookin' real good honey We're going on the town now Looking for easy money We're going on the town tonight Looking for easy money
<h> Lyrics
<p> I'll mow your lawn, clean the leaves out' your drain I'll mend your roof, to keep out the rain I take the work that God provides I'm a jack of all trades, honey we'll be all right
<p> I'll hammer the nails, I'll set the stone I'll harvest your crops, when they're ripe and grown I'll pull that engine apart, and patch'er up 'til she's running right I'm a jack of all trades, we'll be all right
<p> The hurricane blows, brings the hard rain When the blue sky breaks It feels like the world's gonna change And we'll start caring for each other Like Jesus said that we might I'm a jack of all trades, we'll be all right
<p> The banker man grows fat, working man grows thin It's all happened before and it'll happen again It'll happen again, yeah they'll bet your life I'm a jack of all trades, darling we'll be all right
<p> Now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood We stood the drought, now we'll stand the flood There's a new world coming, I can see the light I'm a jack of all trades, we'll be all right
<p> So you use what you've got and you learn to make do You take the old, you make it new If I had me a gun, I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight I'm a jack of all trades, we'll be all right I'm a jack of all trades, we'll be all right
<h> Lyrics
<p> Well, no cannon ball did fly, no rifles cut us down No bombs fell from the sky, no blood soaked the ground No powder flash blinded the eye No deathly thunder sounded But just as sure as the hand of God They brought death to my hometown They brought death to my hometown
<p> Now, no shells ripped the evening sky No cities burning down No army stormed the shores for which we'd die No dictators were crowned I awoke on a quiet night, I never heard a sound The marauders raided in the dark And brought death to my hometown They brought death to my hometown
<p> They destroyed our families, factories And they took our homes They left our bodies on the plains The vultures picked our bones
<p> So, listen up my sonny boy, be ready when they come For they'll be returning sure as the rising sun Now get yourself a song to sing And sing it 'til you're done Sing it hard and sing it well Send the robber barons straight to hell The greedy thieves who came around And ate the flesh of everything they found Whose crimes have gone unpunished now Who walk the streets as free men now
<p> They brought death to our hometown, boys Death to our hometown Death to our hometown, boys Death to our hometown
<h> Lyrics
<p> I was raised outta steel Here in the swamps of Jersey Some misty years ago Through the mud and the beer The blood and the cheers I've seen champions come and go So if you've got the guts mister Yeah, if you got the balls If you think it's your time Then step to the line And bring on your wrecking ball
<p> Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball C'mon and take your best shot Let me see what you got Bring on your wrecking ball
<p> Now, my home's here in these meadowlands Where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes Here where the blood is spilled The arena's filled and giants played their games
<p> Now, when all this steel and these stories Drift away to rust And all our youth and beauty Has been given to the dust When the game has been decided And we're burnin' down the clock And all our little victories and glories Have turned into parking lots When your best hopes and desires Are scattered to the wind And hard times come and hard times go and Hard times come and hard times go and Hard times come and hard times go and Hard times come and hard times go and Hard times come and hard times go Yeah, just to come again
<p> Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball C'mon and take your best shot Let me see what you got Bring on your wrecking ball
<p> Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball C'mon and take your best shot Let me see what you got Bring on your wrecking ball
<p> Tend to your flock or they will stray We'll be called for our service come judgment day Before we cross that river wide The blood on our hands will come back on us twice
<p> Rise up shepherd, rise up Your flock has roamed far from the hill The stars have faded, the sky is still Sun's in the heavens and a new day is rising
<p> You use your muscle and your mind and you pray your best That your best is good enough, the Lord will do the rest You raise your children and you teach them to walk straight and sure You pray that hard times, hard times come no more You try to sleep you toss and turn the bottom's dropping out Where you once had faith now there's only doubt You pray for guidance only silence now meets your prayers The morning breaks, you awake, but no one's there
<h> Lyrics
<p> Grab your ticket and your suitcase Thunder's rollin' down this track Well, you don't know where you're goin' now But you know you won't be back Well, darlin' if you're weary Lay your head upon my chest We'll take what we can carry Yeah, and we'll leave the rest
<p> Big wheels roll through fields Where sunlight streams Meet me in a land of hope and dreams
<p> Well, I will provide for you And I'll stand by your side You'll need a good companion now For this part of the ride Leave behind your sorrows Let this day be the last Tomorrow there'll be sunshine And all this darkness past
<p> Big wheels roll through fields Where sunlight streams Oh meet me in a land of hope and dreams
<p> This train... Carries saints and sinners This train... Carries losers and winners This train... Carries whores and gamblers This train... Carries lost souls
<p> I said this train... Dreams will not be thwarted This train... Faith will be rewarded
<h> Also Appears On
<h> Lyrics
<p> There's a cross up yonder on Calvary Hill There's a slip of blood on a silver knife There's a graveyard kid down below Where at night the dead come to life Well above the stars they crackle and fire A dead man's moon throws seven rings We'd put our ears to the cold grave stones This is the song they'd sing
<p> We are alive And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark Our spirits rise To carry the fire and light the spark To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart A voice cried I was killed in Maryland in 1877 When the railroad workers made their stand I was killed in 1963 One Sunday morning in Birmingham I died last year crossing the southern desert My children left behind in San Pablo Well they've left our bodies here to rot Oh please let them know
<p> We are alive And though we lie alone here in the dark Our souls will rise To carry the fire and light the spark To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
<p> Let your mind rest easy Sleep well my friend It's only our bodies that betray us in the end
<p> Well I awoke last night in the dark and dreamy deep From my head to my feet my body'd gone stone cold There were worms crawling all around me My fingers scratchin' at an earth black and six foot low
<p> Alone in the blackness of my grave Alone I'd been left to die Then I heard voices calling all 'round me The earth rose above me My eyes filled with sky
<p> We are alive And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark Our souls and spirits rise To carry the fire and light the spark To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart We are alive
<h> Lyrics
<p> I fell asleep on a dark and starlit sea With nothing but the cloak of God's mercy over me I come upon strange earth and a great black cave I dreamt I awoke as if buried in my grave
<p> We've been swallowed up We've been swallowed up Disappeared from this world We've been swallowed up
<p> The bones of sailors from the north and sailors from the east Lay high in a pyre in the belly of a beast A beast should you wander in its path upon your ship and your flesh he'll sup You'll disappear from this world until you've been swallowed up
<p> We've been swallowed up We've been swallowed up Disappeared from this world We've been swallowed up
<p> We trusted our skills and our good sails Our faith that with God the righteous in this world prevail
<p> But we've been swallowed up We've been swallowed up Disappeared from this world We've been swallowed up
<p> We've been swallowed up We've been swallowed up Disappeared from this world We've been swallowed up
<h> Lyrics
<p> What is this land America so many travel there I'm going now while I'm still young my darling meet me there Wish me luck my lovely I'll send for you when I can And we'll make our home in the American land
<p> Over there all the woman wear silk and satin to their knees And children dear, the sweets, I hear, are growing on the trees Gold comes rushing out the rivers straight into your hands When you make your home in the American Land
<p> There's diamonds in the sidewalk the's gutters lined in song Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man Who will make his home in the American Land
<p> I docked at Ellis Island in a city of light and spires She met me in the valley of red-hot steel and fire We made the steel that built the cities with our sweat and two hands And we made our home in the American Land
<p> There's diamonds in the sidewalk the's gutters lined in song Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man Who will make his home in the American Land
<p> The McNicholas, the Posalski's, the Smiths, Zerillis, too The Blacks, the Irish, Italians, the Germans and the Jews Come across the water a thousand miles from home With nothin in their bellies but the fire down below
<p> They died building the railroads worked to bones and skin They died in the fields and factories names scattered in the wind They died to get here a hundred years ago they're still dyin now The hands that built the country were always trying to keep down
<p> There's diamonds in the sidewalk the gutters lined in song Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man Who will make his home in the American Land Who will make his home in the American Land Who will make his home in the American Land
