<h> Book Description
<p> Publication Date: June 2000
<p> On the Korean peninsula one of the greatest success stories of the post- war era confronts a famine-ridden and possibly nuclear- armed totalitarian state. The stakes are extraordinarily high for both North and South Korea, and for countries such as the United States that have a direct stake in these affairs. This study (*), the most comprehensive volume to date on the subject, examines the current situation in the two Koreas in terms of three major crises: the nuclear confrontation between the United States and North Korea, the North Korean famine, and the South Korean financial crisis. Out of these, the future of the peninsula is then explored under three alternative scenarios: successful reform in North Korea, collapse and absorption (as happened in Germany), and muddling through in which North Korea, supported by foreign powers, makes ad hoc, regime-preserving reforms that fall short of fundamental transformation. June 2000. 300 pages (approx.). ISBN: paper 0-88132-278-4. $22.00.

<h> Editorial Reviews
<h> Review
<p> " . . . (This) encyclopedic coverage of the two Korean economies . . . will be widely read and cited." -- Il SaKong, Chairman and CEO of the Institute for Global Economics and former Minister of Finance of the Republic of South Korea
<p> "Avoiding the Apocalypse is unique in its breadth and rigor...essential reading for anyone interested in the future of Korea." -- Joe Stiglitz, Former Senior Vice President of Development Economics and Chief Economist of the World Bank
<p> "Noland has digested everything that can be relied upon to understand North Korea and made it widely accessible." -- Journal of Asian Studies; Lawrence B. Krause, UC San Diego
<h> More About the Author
<p> I am an economist working at the interstice of economics, political science, and international relations. My book, "Avoiding the Apocalypse: the Future of the Two Koreas," won the prestigious Ohira Memorial Prize. My recent books are "Witness to Transformation: Refugee Insights into North Korea" (co-authored with Stephan Haggard), and "Arab Economies in a Changing World" (co-authored with Howard Pack).
<p> In addition to these (and other) books I have written many scholarly articles on isues such as international economics, US trade policy, and the economies of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as op-eds for publications such as Newsweek International, the International Herald Tribune, the Financial Times, and the Washington Post. I have served as an occasional consultant to organizations such the National Intelligence Council and have testified before the US Congress on numerous occasions.
<p> By drawing on other-country parallels such as German unification, or the experiences of China and Vietnam as they re-engaged with the world community, "Avoiding the Apocalypse" provides interesting insights about N. Korea's future and the possible implications for the South. This book is unique among other N. Korea titles in that it is underpinned by rigorous economic analysis while, at the same time, exhibiting a sound understanding of geopolitical dynamics of the peninsula and of the interests of key player countries (S. Korea, Japan, US, China). The book presents a comprehensive analysis of N. Korea's economy and policies (past and present), and an assessment of future prospects for the Korea peninsula in light of several plausible alternative scenarios of policy developments in the North.
<p> "Avoiding the Apocalypse" contains a wealth and depth of information Mr. Noland has obviously acquired through his research and interactions with key economic, political and military personalities in North and South Korea, Japan, the US and China. I found this book to be very well written, and in a style accessible to a general educated readership. Unusually for such a weighty book, the text includes cross-cultural sayings (i.e. proverbs) and metaphors, in addition to insider quotes, that make the book an interesting read indeed.
<p> I recommend the book highly for anyone interested in a thorough review of N. Korea and in knowing what the current state of play is as regards N. Korea's integration into the world community of nations. If you're interested in a fresh and intellectually stimulating perspective on the events unfolding on the Korean peninsula, this is also the book for you.
<p> Winston Churchill described the Soviet Union as "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma," but then again, unlike Marcus Noland, Churchill never visited North Korea.
<p> South Korea has risen from the ashes of the war to become a modern country. North Korea faces a famine. (My church and many others are involved in famine relief there.) If the North Koreans opened up their system they could catch up with South Korea -- afterall, they are all Koreans. As it is, they rely on selling missiles to countries like Pakistan, worsening the Pakistani confrontation with India, and creating headaches for the US and other countries.
<p> This book examines this geopolitical hot spot. It analyzes the missile and nuclear issue, the famine, and the financial crisis in South Korea. It then considers three scenarios for the future of the Korean peninsula. The economics can get a bit heavy going, but it is not difficult to follow the thread of the argument. This book is particularly good on the issue of how developments in the North could affect political and economic developments in the South. It would behoove President Bush and his advisors to read this book.
<p> This book is a delight - the author combines serious economic and political analysis with rich knowledge of institutions and history on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, he knows how to write. He makes sophisticated arguments seem easy. For readers concerned with the future of South and North Korea, this is essential reading.
<p> The book consists of a thorough overview of the current situation on the peninsula with a brief but insightful review of the historical processes that have brought us to this point. It distills in a accessible manner the vital insights from the author's formal models of the Korean economy. Most importantly, it weaves all of these different viewpoints into a coherent and persuasive story.
