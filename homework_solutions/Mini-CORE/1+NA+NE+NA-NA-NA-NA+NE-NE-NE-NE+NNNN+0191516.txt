<p> "Mothers have to stop their cars, get out, try and unbuckle two kids, then get them to the shelter," director of the Sderot Media Cente,  Noam Bedein, told News Ltd.
<p> "What the mothers are discovering is it's impossible to stop the car, get out and get seatbelts off two kids .... they are being forced to choose: which child do I save?"
<p> Speaking at the Sderot police station Mr Bedein says it's hard to lead your life constantly looking out for missile shelters just in case your 15 second race for life starts.
<p> In the past week, more than 100 Hamas missiles have hit this working-class city of more than 20,000 people.
<p> Bedein says the town is now preparing for the fallout of a possible Israeli ground troop invasion into Gaza for the first time since 2009, to force peace on the region
<p> "This can't continue," he tells us. "It has to stop.
<p> The city is on the frontline, sitting just 3km from Gaza. From the ridge on the city's fringe, the mosques and tightly packed apartment blocks of Gaza - home to 1.5 million Palestinians - are clearly visible.

<p> Sderot is so close that Israel's new iron dome anti-missile system doesn't even have time to shoot them down.
<p> In the past week, rockets have crashed into schools and homes.
<p> Within an hour of our interview, the Israeli defence force had launched a decapitation airstrike into Gaza, killing Hamas leader Ahmed Khalil al-Jabari - dubbed by Israel as the Osama of Hamas - and others. Within minutes, Bedein was bunkered down in his shelter with the rest of the terrified inhabitants.
<p> Bedein, who has lived in Sderot for six years, said Israeli air strikes were continuing into the early evening and that residents were preparing for a full-scale retaliation from Hamas factions in Gaza.
<p> "It's crazy, there are explosions everywhere," he said.

<p> He said the town's 20,000 residents had been ordered into shelters and schools had been closed indefinitely.
<p> The rocket attacks typically begin as children walk to school in the morning.
<p> "It's very intense at the moment. We are preparing for a full attack," he said.
<p> "It's crazy, there are explosions everywhere."
<p> The Australian-born Israeli Government spokesman Mark Regev defended the strikes claiming that Israel was defending itself after days of rocket attacks on its civilians.
<p> "No-one should have to live this way," he said.
<p> "We have acted as any responsible government would do to protect them."

<p> He said Jabari had been responsible for hundreds of rocket attacks on Israeli towns including the Beersheva, where the Australian Light Horse Brigade are remembered for their heroic feats in 1918.
<p> Hamas says the air strike is a declaration of war. But for Sderot, they have been locked in a war for years.
<p> Some 2000 rockets have been fired into it by Hamas and other jihadist groups since 2009.
<p> "This is our rocket reality," Bedein says.
<p> Just an hour before the fresh barrage of rockets hit, Sivan Ahnukayev couldn't control her emotions any longer.
<p> The 23-year-old Sderot student told the Herald Sun and Daily Telegraph: "When the rockets come in I wish they were all dead and Gaza was erased. But when the rockets stop, I change my mind. I know not all the people of Gaza are responsible and after the rockets I don't want me dead. We don't blame all of them."
<p> As she vents, Ahnukayev cradles the twisted remains of a Hamas rocket.
<p> We are at the Sderot police station, which houses a gruesome collection of hundreds of rockets ... or at least what remains of them.
<p> Most appear to be crude, backyard rockets, packed with nails, bolts and anything else that will make deadly shrapnel.
<p> "You know, in Sderot, there is no post traumatic stress ... because the terror is not over. We are living it every day," she says.
<p> "It's like playing Russian roulette every day: You never know when the alarm is going to sound, and your 15 seconds starts."
<p> That alarm is called tzeva adom - translated it means colour red - and starts off with a screech, before a woman's calm voice starts repeating "tzeva adom" over the city's speaker system.
