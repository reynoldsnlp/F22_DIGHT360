<p> I thought of a metaphor recently that put me at peace with my position in the world, and more importantly, everyone else's too. This is how I learned to stop hating and start loving the human race.
<p> Humans are a herding species. The center of the herd is the safest place to be, but invariably some are bound to find themselves on the edge looking out into the abyss. Some people are born on the outside, some naturally migrate there from the inside, and others are forced out due to just being different. A person can decide to dig their way back into the herd (sometimes only to be rejected again), or instead consider a new role on the outskirts. The outskirts are where the herdsman are; the scouts, the discoverers, the inventors, the entertainers, the risk takers, the leaders. While the herd remains buffered from nature, they rightly recognize those who survive the wild to discover interesting and safe new places for the herd to go, with nothing short of adoration. Thus there is a symbiotic relationship formed between those who lead and those who follow.
<p> I've always felt parts of the above my whole life, and only within the last couple of years have I been able to refine it to the above paragraph. I never truly fit in the center of the crowd, and I looked to the edge with apprehension...now that I understand and have accepted where I am I can act without fear, because I've realized that I essentially have no alternative. There is still great risk in what I do, but great reward also should I survive it intact and bring back something cool. I will always be, however, a member of the herd myself.
<p> This message is to give heart to those who find themselves on the edge, unable to see it for the opportunity it is -- you know who you are.
