<p> An unbylined Charlotte Observer Q&A with Jim Nantz (tied to Sunday's Panthers game) includes some fun stuff about revisiting his childhood home, fans saying "Hello Friends" to him (so original!), recording voiceovers for Tiger Woods' EA video game (Hello Friends!) and his move to Pebble Beach this year.
<p> Q. Is it true you live at Pebble Beach Golf Links?
<p> I moved to Pebble Beach full time this year. I'm looking at the seventh green right now. It's all beautiful. We got married June 9 and we moved in that very night.
<p> Q. You got married in June on the famous seventh hole there. Why did you pick that spot?
<p> In the book I wrote, "Always By My Side," I wrote a couple of pages about how the seventh hole was such a spiritual setting to me and I always felt my father's presence there. Every day during the years we covered the Pebble Beach golf tournament, I would march out there before the sun was up and sit on the rail fence there in prayerful introspection and think about all the blessings in my life.
<p> Nantz's telecasts are tolerable - barely, but what are not tolerable are the Titleist commercials that pack every cheesy thing he does into one 30 second spot. They make me want to NOT buy their golf balls.
<p> Nantz is primarily an American Football announcer (which I don;t watch any longer). He is cultivated to be just smarmy enough to rope in as many sports fans of all types as possible to enhance the Nielsen numbers.
<p> Give me the BBC guys who go silent for 5-20 minutes at a time during the Open Championship.
<p> Golf telebroadcasts have far too much time spent on greens and far too much commentary that anyone who is actually a fan of Golf rather than Sports will find somewhere on the scale from relatively a waste of time to a glorious waste of silence.
<p> As for his speaking in person at the banquets I've attended - whilst he speaks I fall into gloriously deep sleep.
<p> The book about his father his relationship with his father and their family dealing with his father's memory loss is excellent. I think since he's moved forward with his personal life his broadcasts have re-emerged as peerless. He doesn't need to dominate a broadcast ala Bob Costas. He feels he's inviting you into the booth with him and presenting the broad stories for the day.
<p> I feel him and Faldo are the best at majors and significant tournaments while NBC is better for run of the mill tour events.
