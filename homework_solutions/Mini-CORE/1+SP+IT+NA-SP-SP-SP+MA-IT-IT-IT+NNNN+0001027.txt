<h> The Wanted interview: 'We're excited to work with Chris Brown'
<p> What with the hectic Christmas album release schedule now in full swing, we'll admit that we breathed a sigh of relief when The Wanted announced their decision to put back their third studio set until next year.
<p> With their current single 'I Found You' on course for another impressive chart position this Sunday, we met up with the guys to talk about their US takeover and what we can expect from the next LP.
<p> Your new single is out this week; do you all still find that sort of thing exciting? Jay McGuiness: "Definitely! Do you like it?"
<p> We certainly do. It's sang in quite a high key; is it quite hard to perform if you're tired or hungover? Jay [sings] "I found youuuuuu! " Tom Parker: "To be honest, the chorus is the easiest part to sing. Most of us could sing like that all the time if we had to." Jay: "It's actually much harder to sing in your normal range when you're hungover as it requires more lung power." Nathan Sykes: "I just don't bother. I have to save myself for that difficult middle eight."
<p> It's doing quite well in the charts, but it's not number one. Is there any part of you that's secretly a bit disappointed? Jay: "It might climb to number two, which we'd obviously be very happy with." Tom: "It's number 18 on US iTunes at the moment, which we're also very happy about! It's taken a lot less time to take off then 'Glad You Came'." Max George: "In all honesty, we've been saying we want a number one with this song ever since we recorded it. We're up against Robbie and Labrinth who both have brilliant songs, and Adele is sniffing around the top five. We can't complain with where it is."
<p> The song is called 'I Found You'; what's the most important thing you've lost? Tom: "My grandma." Jay: "How are any of us supposed to top that?! I've lost 21 phones and five bank cards in three years." Max: "My dog Pele." Siva: "My beauty sleep." Nathan: "My dignity!"
<p> You've delayed your new album until next year because it isn't ready. Is there a part of you that's glad to be avoiding the hectic Christmas release schedule? Jay: "Kind of, although we've never had a number one album so we haven't pushed it back for any chart position reason. Our record label were really keen for us to release the album in the fourth quarter because sales are at their highest. We accepted that, but we're going to have to live with this album, it's our first worldwide album and we want to get it right. It's no fun performing or promoting if you don't believe in the music."
<p> It felt like the singles run from your last album ended very abruptly because you had to be in America... Tom: "Honestly, we didn't think our last album was as strong as our first." Max: "It was different - too different." Nathan: "With this next album I think we're going to take the darkness from our last record but add in the feeling of our first. This album will be bigger and more uplifting and optimistic."
<p> There have been a lot of stories about who you're going to work with on it. Is the Chris Brown duet still on the cards? Tom: "It's hopefully still happening, which is another reason why we don't want to rush anything out. We don't want to disappoint ourselves or our fans." Jay: "The Justin Bieber collab is just because of [manager] Scooter's connection - it's just gossip really. There aren't any gears in motion to do it. Chris Brown is different, he came to our rehearsal studio and approached us again at an awards show and is really keen to do it. We're not sure what's happening with LMFAO, now they've disbanded."
<p> RedFoo writes surprisingly good pop songs for artists like Carly Rae Jepsen. Jay: "Maybe we'll just work with him then." Nathan: "We've written with SkyBlu too and he's pretty good!"
<p> Seriously though, what's it like to have Chris Brown roll up to one of your rehearsals? Max: "We were rehearsing for American Idol and he literally just came in and said hello and was very complimentary about our music. We're in LA next week so hopefully we can get a song down with him. I'm really excited about it actually, I can't wait to see what we come up with."
<p> Have you been watching X Factor this year? Tom: "I think the talent on this year's show is quite average. There are two or three good acts and that's about it." Max: "To be fair though, we all say this every year. When you look back you realise most of the contestants are crap. James is pretty good - he's quite awkward to watch - but he's a great singer. Union J are brilliant as well."
<p> There's been quite a lot of criticism about the judging lineup. Who do you think should go? Jay: "Louis will never go, he did Westlife, didn't he?"
<p> That's what we hear. Jay: "Not like that!" Max: "I think Gary should go. I like him, but I prefer seeing him in Take That. I'd like to see a new Gary or Simon in the lineup, because they're the most influential person on the panel. I'd like to see Simon come back for one series, that would change everything again."
<p> The Wanted's new single 'I Found You' is out now. Their new album follows in March 2013.
