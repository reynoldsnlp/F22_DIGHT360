<h> Ad Industry's Q2 May Not Be as Good as Expected
<p> The ad industry's second quarter may not be turning out as well as expected. That's the view of at least one financial observer: Brian Wieser , senior research analyst, Pivotal Research Group, says he is revising his organic revenue growth estimates downward, which he believes have been above consensus.
<p> While he says that Pivotal's new expectations for full-year result levels remain within previous corporate guidance, Wieser voices concerns particularly about a short-term misalignment between agency growth trends and the broader media economy which he thinks will correct itself over subsequent quarters. But Wieser warns: "The 'fiscal cliff' and ongoing risks associated with the European economy could make the likelihood of this correction somewhat more challenging."
<p> The revision also includes diminished longer-term growth expectations in many of the world's fastest-growing ad markets like China and India.
<p> Nonetheless, Wieser said he remains "very positive" about the mid-term and long-term prospects for agency holding companies.
<p> Wieser, who at one point in his career was evp, global director of forecasting at Interpublic's MagnaGlobal, has recently been in the news . He warned his clients about not buying Facebook shares during the social network's initial public offering, saying the stock was overpriced when it began trading.
