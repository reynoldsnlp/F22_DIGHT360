<h> Download eBook: How to Find a Job Now (...and never have to look again!)
<h> Did you know that you are overlooking thousands (if not millions) of job opportunities everyday?
<p> I wrote an ebook on job / career hunting called "How To Find a Job Now (and never have to look for a job again)." I have already produced several videos on job hunting strategies, spoken at career ministries and job seeker event s, written articles on how to find hidden jobs, contributed to a few books , participated in podcasts and achieved some notoriety in the recruiting world but, I do not have a book of my own. It has been suggested to me on several occasions that I should do so and I feel that now is the right time.
<h> I was quoted in: Globe and Mail, US News and World Report, Wall Street Journal and The Atlanta Journal and Constitution.  Monster.com, Entrepreneur Magazine, Black Enterprise and The HR Examiner have all cited my contribution to job seekers.
<p> I have been involved in the recruiting industry for over a decade and have worked for such companies as Google, Microsoft, Siemens, MCI and a host of startup companies. I have produced award winning blogs, been featured in several leading publications and have been cited several times for my digital influence. Check out my LinkedIn profile to learn more about me and to network.
