<h> Just The Guy To Do It Lyrics
<h> Toby Keith
<p> Do blondes really have more fun Or they just easier to spot in the dark? Girl, I'm just tryin' to cheer you up I saw you sittin' over here all alone, with a broken heart It's hurtin' you real bad, wish there was somethin' that I had I'd hook you up, get you through it You might need a man to hold you 'til it don't I'm just the guy to do it Is that your pretty boy standin' There at the end of the bar, he's got some nerve Talkin' loud and drinkin' with a red head Ridin' shotgun on his arm, he's such a jerk I think he's a knucklehead All those ugly things he said were out of line, man, he blew it Ah, he might need someone to put him in his place I'm just the guy to do it Baby, I can't mend your broken heart I can't take away your pain I can't promise you the sun is gonna shine When you're walkin' in the rain If you need a hero for tonight I can be the one, let me prove it Yeah, you just say the magic words and we'll be gone I'm just the guy to do it Baby, I can't mend your broken heart I can't take away your pain I can't promise you the sun is gonna shine When you're walkin' in the rain If you need a hero for tonight I can be the one, let me prove it Yeah, you just say the magic words and we'll be gone I'm just the guy to do it Do blondes really have more fun Or are they just easier to spot in the dark?
