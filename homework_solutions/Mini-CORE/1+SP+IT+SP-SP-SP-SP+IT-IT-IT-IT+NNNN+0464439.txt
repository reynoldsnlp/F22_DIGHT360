<h> GQ&A: Jamie Bell
<p> We begin with a slight Californian drawl and end with a broad Yorkshire brogue. Over the course of our time with the star of Steven Spielberg 's new version of Tintin , Jamie Bell's accent slowly crosses the Atlantic. Forever linked with his role as an unlikely ballerina in Billy Elliot , Bell has since played a huge variety of roles from a teleporter in Jumper to a clergyman in Jane Eyre . Here he talks to GQ.com about his love of milkshakes, how to please a woman and his fondness for Greggs...
<p> GQ.com: What's small talk with Steven Spielberg like? Jamie Bell: I was so nervous to reveal how much of a fanboy I am in case he started thinking, "Oh my God, we've cast a maniac." So it's only been recently, hanging out with Steven and doing all the press that I've been able to go, "Dude, that decision in Hook when he does this thing..." But I held my tongue for the longest time.
<p> You've described Tintin as " Hitchcockian ". Which of his films does it resemble most? Strangers On A Train or The 39 Steps . Lots of people looking over their shoulders in very low lighting, revealing bits of information and ending up dead.
<p> What's the strangest gift you've ever got from a fan? I've got lots of weird illustrations of me from Japanese fans. I also got a dead moth. [ Pause ] Which actually might be more of a threat than a present.
<p> What's your top style tip for autumn? For me, I'm a small chap and I like jackets to fit real tight. If you're taller you can go for looser stuff. When I wear jackets I like to pop the collar up on them - I think more guys should do that. It changes it from a very formal [look] to more of a sports thing.
<p> Having screen-tested for Spider-man , what superhero role would you like to have a crack at next? Considering I failed at the first one, I don't know. I've never felt particularly connected to Peter Parker, [so] I felt like they made the right decision. I actually can't wait to see the movie - I think it's going to be great. My favourite superhero is obviously Batman because he's the sexiest. But I can't imagine myself as Batman ...
<p> What's the first thing you do when you get back from LA? I miss my friends and stuff, doing the things we used to do. But it's really important that I'm over there. I just flew into Newcastle the other day, and the first thing I said was, "I'm getting Greggs. I don't even care, man - I want a Cornish pasty and I want it now."
<p> What's the best way to impress a woman? Buy her flowers? Take her home on the weekend to meet your mother? No. Let's cut to the primal - be good in the sack. [ Slaps thighs ] Have an understanding of what's going on down there and have fun, awesome sex.
<p> What's the question you hate being asked? If I hear "What was it like working with Steven Spielberg ?" one more time, I might jump out of that window. "Do you miss England?" is really annoying. The third one is "How did you avoid the pitfalls of being a child actor?" I don't even know what that means. Do child stars hit pitfalls? That's such a stereotypical thing to say. I know lot of actors who have started off as kids and I feel it's really unfair.
<p> What should no man have in his wardrobe? Crocs. It's just not on.
<p> What do people still get wrong about you? They think I'm a nice guy. [ grins ]
<p> Who, in your opinion, is overrated? There's a really funny joke there but I don't know what it is. Probably me, actually.
<p> What film do you consider particularly stylish? Definitely Drive . Even just the promotion and marketing on that movie is awesome. [ Mimics the pitch ] "It's a cool stunt-guy action movie and let's make the font look like Dirty Dancing ." You're going to get women through the door. Well, I mean, you're going to get women through the door anyway with Gosling...
<p> What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? What's the best penis I've ever seen?
<p> No! Actually, what is the best penis you've ever seen? [ Collapses into laughter ] That is a good question. The best piece of advice I ever received was "Don't f*** your publicist." Russell Crowe told me that. It's probably a smart move. [ Both of his publicists are now in the room, attempting to bring the interview to a close ] No! It's GQ !
<p> What skill should every man have? Skill? You know what I'm going to say. A man should have a good understanding of a vagina. He should be good at oral sex. On a woman.
<p> You do realise you've got another publicist standing right behind you? I don't care. A skill a man should have? Making fires and pleasing a woman. In the vaginal area.
<p> What's the strangest thing you've ever bought? Bought? [ hesitates, deliberates, looks concerned ] This is going to end up on Google. God... [ desperately tries to think of an alternative ] Er, no, that's lame. No, I can't, no way, no, seriously, because then the Google alert: "Bell buys..." I don't know, I buy crazy s*** all the time. I wish I had all these amazingly cool answers. Do you think actors sometimes just make it up to sound awesome?
<p> Probably. I wish I was good at that.
<p> The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn is out on 26 October.
