<h> A big picture idea that still looks a bit fuzzy
<p> Labor went to the polls under Kevin Rudd five years ago promising a national broadband network that would deliver high-speed internet to all Australians. It was a big picture idea that captured the imagination of a nation excited by the prospect of a new world of technology
<p> Originally expected to cost about $15 billion, including government funding of $4.7 billion, that model was scrapped two years later in favour of a much bolder and more expensive plan after an aborted tender process in which Telstra was controversially excluded.
<p> The NBN became a key political debate during the 2010 federal election campaign, helping Labor scrape back in for a second term, albeit as a minority government. Yet project delays and rising costs mean it is less likely to be a vote winner next time around.
<p> Although the project to build a national broadband network has become one of Labor's most high-profile policies, thanks in no small part to its now $37.4 billion price tag, the concept of widely available high-speed broadband existed before it. In January 2003, the Howard government's Broadband Advisory Group submitted a report calling for a national strategy that would make broadband available to all Australians at fair and reasonable prices.
<p> Then, as now, education and health were cited as examples of where broadband technology could help make Australia a world leader in what has come to be known as the digital economy.
<p> A series of false starts over the next six years gave some early indication of the complexities that would be associated with delivering on this ambitious goal.
<p> Telstra announced plans for a fibre to the node network (FTTN) in November 2005 but scrapped them just nine months later after failing to gain support from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. A consortium of nine telcos known as G9 -- AAPT, Internode, iiNet, Macquarie Telecom, Optus, PowerTel, Primus, Soul and TransACT -- proposed another FTTN network in 2007 but those plans also fell foul of the ACCC.
<p> In June 2007 Opel Networks -- a joint venture between Optus and Elders -- was awarded a contract to improve rural and regional access to broadband only to have its contract ripped up by Communications Minister Stephen Conroy less than a year later.
<p> Instead, Labor announced it would build its own FTTN broadband network. It went to market and received six proposals from Acacia, Axia NetMedia, Optus, Telstra, TransACT and the Tasmanian government.
<p> In what will long be remembered as a low point in Telstra's often troubled relationship with government, Conroy spectacularly barred the telco from the bidding process in December 2008, saying it lacked sufficient detail. Four months later, the whole process was abandoned with none of the bids deemed suitable. While this was a surprise, it would be nothing in comparison to what came next.
<p> Instead of FTTN that would deliver high-speed fibre to street corners, Conroy announced plans in April 2009 for a much more ambitious fibre to the premises (FTTP) network. To be built by the newly created NBN Co, headed by former Alcatel executive Mike Quigley, it would deliver fibre directly into 93 per cent of Australian homes and businesses with the remainder to be services by wireless and satellite technologies.
<p> Now one of the largest infrastructure projects in the country, price quickly became the main focus of most NBN debate. The Coalition and other detractors in the telco industry called for a cost benefit analysis to justify the hefty levels of taxpayer investment but those demands fell on deaf ears. Labor did spend $25 million on a detailed implementation study, carried out by KPMG and McKinsey & Company, which the government said confirmed its vision was both achievable and affordable.
<p> To keep costs down where possible, it was vital NBN Co strike a deal with Telstra for the telco to decommission its copper network. The two sides eventually came to an $11 billion agreement in June 2010, meaning the network builder can use much of the telco's existing ducts and pipes while also migrating its customers across as the fibre is switched on. It struck a deal with Optus earlier this year that will see its 500,000 cable customers moved across to the NBN.
<p> In a Sydney media briefing yesterday afternoon that outlined NBN Co's corporate plan for the next three years, Conroy said progress had been slower than hoped, largely as a result of these regulatory hurdles. He said the number of new premises passed was lower than expected because construction of those homes had been slower than expected.
<p> NBN Co has added $1.5 billion to its capital expenditure estimates ($37.4 billion) and six months to the network's completion date (June 2021) in its latest corporate plan. It expects network construction to be under way or complete for 758,000 homes by the end of this year and 3.5 million by June 2015.
