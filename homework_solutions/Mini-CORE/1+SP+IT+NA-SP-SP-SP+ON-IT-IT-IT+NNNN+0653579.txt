<h> 'Luxury doesn't have to be expensive'
<p> Francis Kurkdjian, 40, has been named 'Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres', one of France's highest honours, for his cutting edge take on perfume. Le Male, created for Jean-Paul Gaultier, is the world's top-selling fragrance for men. Kurkdjian has recently opened a Paris boutique and lives in the city.
<p> You're French of Armenian descent. Did you grow up in Paris? I grew up in Gournay-sur-Marne, a very small town in the eastern suburbs of Paris. We were a very close family and my grandparents played a big part in my life. My grandfather was a tailor and the tiny house was filled with music, art, the odours of sewing machine oil, tailor's chalk and the fragrant scent of spices coming from the larder.
<p> Why did you decide to live in the 10th arrondissement? I knew the neighbourhood. I rented here in 1999 when I moved back from New York. It's a great location, a couple of miles from the centre of Paris, not too far from Opra Garnier, the Bastille and the Comdie Franaise. I've lived here for five years and what I like about the neighbourhood is the mix of Indian, African and Middle Eastern cultures. It's a sunny apartment. The building is huge, the former offices of The Globe newspaper. The faade is landmarked as a fine example of art deco style. It was also home to Jean Jaurs, the charismatic leader of the French Socialist party. There are three interior courtyards and secret passages that lead to the other side of the building.
<h> IN House & Home
<p> How many homes do you have? Just this Paris apartment, which I'm very proud of. I'm not very good at holidays but some years I rent a house on Formentera [the Balearic island] or stay with friends in the Ronda, Spain.
<p> How would you describe the decor and did you have professional help? The decor is simple, a blend of technology and classicism. The wall of light with neon tubes and LEDs [light-emitting diodes] is the inspiration of designer Vincent Thiesson, a great friend. I like white-painted walls, which offset the furniture, paintings and my nostalgic objects: family photos, an 18th-century Vietnamese screen, an India Mahdavi light bought at auction, a few flea market finds. When I moved into the apartment I worked closely with RMDM, a group of young architects. Recently I spray painted all the ceiling chandeliers white and made a wall of mirrors in the entry hall with oval glass panels from a very cheap builder's merchant. The effect is stunning. Luxury doesn't have to be expensive.
<p> How much time do you spend here? Not as much as I'd like. Since I became "a brand" I travel a great deal in America and Asia. I'm a perfume maker but I have to say I really enjoy the entrepreneurial and diverse sides of Maison Francis Kurkdjian. One of my lines is Apom, an acronym for A Piece of Myself, another is a posh detergent and softener.
<p> What do you look forward to when you return? I love my bed. It's nothing special. I stay in luxurious hotels and homes all over the world but the feeling of my head sinking into my own pillow is bliss. I always have books on the bedside table and recently burnt the midnight oil reading Bad Boy, a biography of Yves Saint Laurent by Marie-Dominique Lelivre.
<p> Do you have a garden or any pets? I rescued a stray canary, christened Hippolyte, from the street. He had a great voice and we used to sing together. He lived in a magnificent pagoda-style wooden cage built by my grandfather. He died a couple of years ago and I was so sad I decided no more pets; the cage sits empty now. There's no garden. To compensate I splash out on orchids and fresh mimosa -- the perfume reminds me of my grandmother.
<p> Do you entertain? I gather my friends together and design a meal around ptissier Christian Tholoniat's semifreddo, a delicate chilled concoction of whipped cream and nougat sandwiched between layers of light sponge cake, the surface caramelised Spanish style with a red-hot iron. When I'm not drinking water I love to drink champagne -- for my dinners I build a faux wall in the kitchen using my favourite Claude Carr champagne. By the end of dinner all the bottles are empty and the wall falls down. The craziest bash was when I was named Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French ministry of culture. I hired a DJ and we partied all night.
<p> Which is your favourite room and do you perfume the spaces? The kitchen. I work there all the time and watch television, even though I have a giant movie screen in the living space. I use the candles I'm working on to judge my works in progress. I'm the first customer to test my products. I have a custom steamer trunk that goes everywhere with me. Inside there's more than 200 scent samples. I'll sit quietly in the kitchen composing new perfumes, mulling over ideas. It's almost a meditation for me.
<p> Does music play a big part in your life? The movie screen, hidden in the ceiling, has a sound system, which is a wonderful luxury. I studied piano and music from the age of seven and was devastated when I failed the exam to study at the school of dance at the Paris Opera. I picked myself up and discovered the world of fashion, not at the centre but at the edge of couture and luxury, with my perfumes. The rejection didn't put me off and I still play Chopin, Mozart and Bach on the 1920 Pleyel baby grand which has pride of place in the living space.
