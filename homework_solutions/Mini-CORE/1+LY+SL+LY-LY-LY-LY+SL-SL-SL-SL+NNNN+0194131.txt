<h> Falling All Over The World Lyrics - Jason Mraz
<p> Said I'm fallin all over the world Said I'm fallin This love affair, It isn't all there but it's everywhere Said I'm fallin all over, fallin over and over But the blue shy, oh blue soul And love with the tole its taken A true crime is the perfect role I love every more that I take in So much that I'd do it again, I'd do it again Said I'm fallin all over the world It's a breath of air, so rare Thick as thunder Said im fallin all over, Every wonder so, full of wonder, so beautiful There's magic up above Every cliche I learn to love But as long as these birds have wings Then I'll have songs, and I'll have words to sing Sing of fallin over, I'm fallin over the whole damn thing said im fallin all over the world said im fallin
