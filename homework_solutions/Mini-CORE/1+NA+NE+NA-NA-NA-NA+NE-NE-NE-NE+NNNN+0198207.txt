<h> Facebook users have a lot to say on debates
<p> POLITICO has joined forces with Facebook to offer readers an exclusive look at the conversation taking place on the social networking site about the Republican presidential candidates ahead of South Carolina's crucial primary on Jan. 21.
<p> Facebook users have strong opinions about presidential debates, according to a Facebook survey of its U.S. users. And they don't always mirror those of voters.

<p> On Dec. 16, for instance, Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman shot to the top of the GOP pack in terms of positive "sentiment" -- roughly 70 percent of the postings and comments on Facebook about them were positive -- according to a monthlong survey done exclusively by Facebook and provided to POLITICO.
<p> That was the day after the Sioux City, Iowa, Fox News debate, the last before the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses. While the Facebook chatter presaged Santorum's surge, users of the social network were more inclined to be supportive of Huntsman than Iowa voters, who gave him just 1 percent in the caucuses.
<p> It was also a day when most of the mainstream media covered the debate and judged who won and lost, and could have been when most Facebook users shared and commented on articles, or even watched the late-night debate, or clips of it, for the first time.
<p> This is the first time that Facebook has undertaken such a survey of its users about presidential candidates. And the results do not always accurately reflect what happens in the early states. The survey, for instance, is not of registered or likely voters, and includes people from all political parties. It also examines Facebook users nationally, not just those in early states such as Iowa. (See Also: Romney, Paul lead Facebook primary )
<p> But the survey of how popular the GOP contenders are on Facebook is nonetheless revealing. Facebook uses a software tool called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to search for positive words like "love" or "nice," and negative words like "hate" and "nasty." Facebook surveys its users automatically and does not read any of the posts itself.
<p> On Jan. 3, the date of the Iowa caucuses, positive sentiment for all the candidates was actually tanking, reaching a low on Jan. 4, the day after Mitt Romney won, trailed closely by Santorum. Facebook did not measure "neutral" chatter about the candidates.
<p> On Jan. 8, the night after the ABC-WMUR debate, Facebook users had nice things to say about Huntsman, Romney and Newt Gingrich. After the Jan. 9 NBC-Facebook morning debate that followed it, Rick Perry seemed to be the one who spiked.
<p> But any of that data could have been influenced by the Jan. 10 New Hampshire primary, in which users were feeling good about Gingrich and Romney on primary day. Romney won, but Gingrich placed fourth.
<p> Facebook uses an automated process to identify and analyze all Facebook posts and comments that are made by U.S. users and mention any of the presidential candidates. The analysis of sentiment is done using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count [http://www.liwc.net/], a well-validated software tool used frequently in social psychological research to identify positive and negative emotion in text. No employees at Facebook or POLITICO read the posts and all measures are aggregated by candidate and by day. Facebook provided POLITICO with total post volumes and average sentiment levels for each candidate from Dec. 12 through Jan. 10.
<p> You are correct! Because of uninformed, leftwing nuts like you, who believe any and all the trash being tossed out by the Obama machine and the leftwing media. Party of nowhere? Please. We are fighting for the very life of a free, competitive, fair country...not a country where nearly 50% do not pay income or state taxes and a good portion get checks back from the Earned Income Credit which is nothing more than welfare. A country where the top 3% pay near 70% of the current taxes. A country that has had its educational system destroyed by progressive, hatemongering unions and liberals. A country that is hated but so depended on by the world that our Fed Chief poured trillions to help bail out the EU as did our treasury secretary. A country that picks winners and losers (like GM or Solyndra) by partisan fiat and then uses hatemongers like Wasserman-Schultz to lie and use hate to promote this administration. Why even Michael Moore proved my point when he complained about the "hold" Fox and radio talk shows have...never once mentioning that 98% if the rest of the media is so biased you cannot hear any other side...THANK GOD FOR THE INTERNET...and no wonder Big sis is spying on us!!
<p> This is news? Of course the protesters are the ones talking, the rest of us are listening! The rest of us know our country is in big trouble! We literally can't afford more of Obama. Whoever the GOP nominee is gets my vote. The leftist media doesn't admit this, but the national debt has accelerated at an unprecendented rate under Obama, and it wasn't pretty to start with. It now EQUALS our entire ECONOMY. Reported in the UK, because the media here isn't honest enough to do so. This debt doesn't even count the fact that things like Obamacare won't add into the total debt until all parts of the law go into effect, and you can count on the fact that it will be much more expensive than projected, just like any other government program. To top off the horrible debt, all branches of the federal government get an automatic 10% increase in budget each year, based upon spending of the previous year. This is since the 70's. It doesn't take a mathematician to realize this is unsustainable growth and will quickly turn us into the EU if we aren't already. And don't count on Congress ever balancing the budget with so many politicians - on both sides- guilty of crony-capitalism with large campaign contributions from tax-exempt corporations.
<p> Contrary to the understanding of those 'standing with the 99%,' Washington has no intention of fixing any problems within Wall Street - they've been in bed with them (on both sides) for generations, and have rigged things in the personal favor of their insider trading and political donors in the forms of tax exemption and government money. According to the recent book, "Throw them all out," a strong majority of the corruption is on the Democrat side. Obama himself has more campaign cash from Wall Street than all the GOP contenders combined. We absolutely need to look for politicians - on both sides- who recognize the culture of corruption in Washington bringing us headlong into financial crisis, and who have the character to withstand Washington's corruption and change things for the citizens of the country. We shouldn't be distracted by the partisan bickering in Washington and be partisan ourselves, that will hardly help the problem.
<p> It never ceases to amaze me how some Democrats will just shout the same talking points over and over without looking at facts, and especially without looking at both sides of an argument. There is plenty of flip-flopping and corruption with Democrats too. Partisanship causes blindness on both sides. You've got to read both sides anymore to get a good idea of what's really going on, because both sides leave stuff out. The liberal media does count on its followers being mind-numbed enough to not think for themselves, however.... It is your duty to be a well-informed voter, not a brainwashed and partisan voter. I'll go even further: to really understand the conservative movement, you've got to listen to (or read) Rush Limbaugh for at least a couple weeks. The 'conservative' media isn't always.
