<p> This edition of Barratts' Blogger of the Week features our first ever Irish site as we chat to Jennie McGinn. Having launched, alongside her two sisters, the incredibly popular What Will I Wear Today she is here to discuss her latest project Prowlster -- a humorous yet insightful on-line magazine which may also alter the way you shop in the future!
<p> How would you describe your blog to Barratts' readers? Prowlster is new type of online magazine and shopping experience. It's an evolution of our fashion blog What Will I Wear Today. We started WWIWT as a group of sisters having a very light-hearted conversation around fashion. We very much positioned ourselves as 'insider-outsiders'; none of us worked in fashion, but we really, really liked fashion. So the tone was very down-to-earth, witty, irreverent and warm. We're going to continue this tone throughout Prowlster -- this is a magazine that is personal, warm and witty. Prowlster is a dynamic fashion magazine, that allows the reader to trend-hunt, style, mood-board and read across a range of fashion topics -- share all this with friends -- and then, shop if you want to. We're basically profiling and platforming all sorts of fashion talent and allowing readers to shop stuff they might not come across otherwise. It's a very social experience; it's important to us that readers feel part of the magazine -- offer tips, make comments, get involved! We're really excited about some of the content we have; we're going to be following a Fashion PR from River Island, we'll be having Roving Reporters doing guerrilla styling in shops around Ireland, we have a Diary from a Parisian Fashion Designer, we have 'Shop The Street Style' -- loads of stuff!
<p> What made you take up blogging? Being able to unleash our ranting on an unsuspecting public! That, and to feel part of a community. It's a very creative experience and a blog really offers an outlet for your various interests. We've had an incredible journey through What Will I Wear Today; writing, styling, doing interviews, going to Fashion Week, acting as spokespeople...and all that as a part-time endeavour. We've enjoyed it so much, we decided to quit our jobs and set up a fashion magazine and shop as an actual business. Are there any tips you would give to someone looking to start their own blog? Reach out to people as much as you can. Ask for help -- if you don't ask, you don't get! Maybe try and assemble a team around you -- it's a very time-consuming process...even as three sisters, we find it incredible demanding. You have to be all things to all people -- a writer, stylist, editor, manager, photographer, spokesperson. Collaborate wherever and whenever possible. Submit your content to as many platforms as you can -- don't be precious! It will help you establish a name for yourself. Come submit to Prowlster -- we don't bite!
<p> How would you describe your style? My personal style is generally a clash of tailoring and edginess. I like to wear at least one statement piece a day if I can -- a Joanne Hynes Collar, a Galibardy knuckleduster, a hint of neon, a little bit of (fake) fur. I wear shorts a lot, because they're handy for cycling and I absolutely love a bit of hot pink. However, I can also be very, very lazy and slouch around in hoodies and checked shirts.
<p> Who are your fashion heroes? The Olsen twins are great for lazy drama, Kate Bosworth manages to hoover up all the high-end edgy stuff. At home here, I love Celestine Cooney for her urban-meets-catwalk look.
<p> Are there any particular trends we should be keeping our eyes open? I hear leather harnesses are going to be big for Spring next year which I'm totally up for -- a bit of pseudo-goth always ramps up the drama. Particularly if you clash the harness with some nice, floaty, chiffon.
<p> Which is your favourite item currently available at Barratts? I am LOVING the Ravel Suede Glitter Block Heel -- it's just the perfect height and the perfect amount of sedate glitter to wear to work!
