<h> All The Way From America Lyrics
<h> Joan Armatrading
<p> You called all the way from America And said hang on to love girl But the weeks and the months and the tears Passed by And my eyes couldn't stand the strain Of that promised love All the way from America You called all the way from America And said I'll soon be home girl But the years and the tears and the fears Passed by And my heart couldn't stand the pain Of that promised love All the way from America All the way from America [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/all-the-way-f\\... ] I stayed all alone and I waited 'round For you to knock at my door But the knock never came and no ring At all And now I sit and wonder why You made that first call All the way from America I don't believe I'll stay here I don't think I wanna wait here any more And if you search for me baby Better bring some more love than you declared All the way from America
