<p> Refugees arriving in Australia by boat will be sent to the Pacific island of Nauru or to Papua New Guinea's Manus Island for processing, confirms Julia Gillard Link to this video
<p> Asylum seekers who try to arrive by boat in Australia will be deported to remote islands in the Pacific under tough new proposals to deter refugees from reaching the country by sea.
<p> In a significant U-turn for the ruling Labor party, Julia Gillard said her government had accepted the recommendations of a panel of experts to reopen processing camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea 's Manus Island.
<p> Legislation to enable the deportation of asylum seekers would be introduced when parliament resumes on Tuesday, the prime minister said. The decision came after months of political wrangling which came to a head in June when two boats carrying refugees capsized north of Christmas Island within a week of each other, killing at least 90 people.
<p> Gillard, like the centre-right opposition Liberal party, argued that refugees should be processed offshore, but the two main parties disagreed about the location. The Labor party wanted to send asylum seekers to Malaysia as part of a swap deal in which Australia would resettle bona fide refugees. But without a majority in parliament -- and lacking the support of the Greens (who hold the balance of power and oppose offshore processing), Gillard was unable to get the required legislation through parliament.
<p> On Monday Gillard said her government had accepted the recommendations of the expert panel convened six weeks ago to find a political solution. "What this report is calling on parliamentarians to do is to compromise and to act. This report is telling us not to stay in our fixed positions but to act and get things done," she said. "When our nation looks at what is happening at sea, too many lives have been lost."
<p> The announcement drew immediate condemnation from human rights groups. Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as "a comprehensive package of harm".
<p> "People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us," she said.
<p> More than 600 refugees have drowned in the past three years. The panel recommended refugees be sent to Nauru and Manus Island for processing to deter others considering undertaking the dangerous voyage to Australia. "We recommend a policy approach that is hard-headed but not hard-hearted. That is realistic not idealistic. That is driven by a sense of humanity as well as fairness," said the panel's chair, Angus Houston, a former air chief marshal.
<p> The panel recommended that the changes to asylum policy should be part of a comprehensive regional framework that could later include Malaysia, provided safeguards and accountability measures governing the agreement with Kuala Lumpur could be strengthened.
<p> It said that the government should apply the principle of "no advantage" to ensure that no benefit was gained through "circumventing regular migration arrangements". Gillard said: "You need to equalise treatment for asylum seekers so you don't get a better deal if you get on a boat."
<p> The panel also recommended increasing Australia's humanitarian intake from 13,750 a year to 20,000, rising to 27,000 over five years, as an incentive for refugees to apply through regular immigration channels. Turning back asylum boats to where they came from was not a safe option at the moment, it said.
<p> Human rights groups said the recommendations were in breach of Australia's international legal obligations.
<p> "Penalising people based on their mode of arrival is clearly in breach of [Australia's] obligations," Graham Thom, of Amnesty International, told ABC television. "We are only talking about people who come by boat, we're not talking about the thousands of people who come by plane and seek asylum in this country. What we are doing is penalising one particular group and actually taking them to a very remote place where we know they've been damaged in the past and holding them hostage to stop other people from coming."
<p> Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as "a comprehensive package of harm".
<p> "People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us," she said.
<p> The UNHCR said it would need to study in more detail the proposals for offshore processing in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. "The efficacy and integrity of such proposals will need to be assessed against their ability to deliver effective protection outcomes to refugees identified as needing protection under international law, not least through the 1951 refugee convention to which Australia is a party," it said in a statement.
<p> The Liberal opposition spokesman on immigration, Scott Morrison, said the panel's findings amounted to an endorsement of his party's policies and gave the government "the opportunity to fix the mess they've made" by resuming the previous Conservative government's policy of offshore processing.
<p> Former Liberal prime minister John Howard set up detention centres on Manus Island and in Nauru. Manus Island was closed in 2004, while former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd shut down the Nauru detention centre soon after he won power in late 2007.
<p> The Greens welcomed the recommendation of increasing the number of humanitarian places, but condemned offshore processing. "This is about a policy that strips out legal protections in Australian law," said the party's leader, Christine Milne. The Greens would not be party to something that was "cruel to people" and "sets up a chain of detention centres right across the Pacific", she said.
<p> This month 650 refugees have been picked up trying to reach Australia by boat. The annual number of arrivals by boat represents about 2% of Australia's total migration.

<p> ==============
<p> They should be forcibly returned and Australia should free itself of any obligation to take these people.
<p> They say it is not safe to return these people but they have often travelled through multiple safe countries and put themselves in jeopardy in sailing the boat, they dont get my sympathy I am afraid.
<p> Send them to that last place they left.
<p> Harsh I know but Australia should not be obliged to take these people.
<p> Offshore processing is inhumane, and was a resounding failure of policy, process and basic human compassion the last time around. Gillard's capitulated to the lowest common denominator in Australian society yet again - the insidous fear of refugees, the mistaken belief that people fleeing persecution have some kind of ordely queue to join to bide their time until their asylum applications have been processed. It's fuelled by ignorance, an inflammtory right-wing media and a political set who'll play on people's worst instincts for votes.
<p> Couldn't agree more, and while they are at it the Australian government should vote to repatriate themselves to whichever land their families came by boat from too. Of course, I will lobby UK parliament to process any returning families of criminals to these shores by opening up a special centres for the propose.No worries
<p> surely this is a mistake, not a government actually doing what the electorate wants, god forbid. What Australia needs is a ruling Liberal elite that don't use public services or know any immigrants telling them (the Australians) that they should have their living standards destroyed through mass immigration because it is enriching. The ruling elite can only suppress wages whilst increasing rents if they entourage/allow/legislate for unfettered immigration and asylum is part of that process.
<p> If we processed asylum seekers off shore the numbers coming here under this pretence would be negligible. The only people who would have a legtimate right to claim asylum here would be those fleeing the republic of Ireland as the UK is the next closest safe country. Everyone else is an economic migrant. This country has long had a history of being the first port of call for those fleeing war or persecution. Gauls fleeing Caesar's armies, Huguenots, Various governments in exile during WWII. It is heartwarming that some want to re-locate here as they feel it safe and liberal enough. But after 40 years + of such immigration it is time to pull up the drawbridge unless there is to be unrest and blood on the streets. Surely the most liberal amongst you can see this???
<p> I'm wondering if perhaps the Australians wanting this policy have seen a program on or visited Luton and seen what mass immigration is all about. Most people seeking asylum in Australia are not being persecuted but economic migrants wanting a better life.
<p> Australia, which is certainly under particular pressure due to its proximity to peninsular Asia, continues to deal poorly with this issue -- a legacy, many say, of white Australia's dreadful record with its aboriginal population. One might imagine that with a population of just over 22 million, a vast country such as Australia might be able to accommodate refugees while their claims were being processed (and offer them asylum), its own resource issues (water) notwithstanding.
<p> The question of how rich countries handle refugees is one that will become ever more pressing as populations increase and as climate change wreaks havoc all over the world, particularly (and most obviously) in the poorest, most populous countries. Those who naively anticipate a Britain more like Madeira once climate change takes hold (as BBC Radio 4's Costing the Earth is promising: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01lsyrk\\... will get a sharp shock from skyrocketing food prices (or lack of some foods) and increased refugee numbers (from within Europe too). Our humanity in dealing justly with people less fortunate than ourselves will be increasingly under the spotlight.
<p> That is, excuse my language, an absolute load of bullshit. Most boat arrivals in Australia are not 'economic migrants.' Have a read, educate yourself, and don't mouth off about a situation you have no knowledge or understanding of.
<p> Regardless if these asylum seekers are political or economic refugees, In my mind the fact that they've shown the courage and grit it takes to undertake such a perilous journey to a country like Australia marks them out as determined high-achievers with excellent problem-solving skills, just the kind of people the country should want as immigrants.
<p> Off-shore processing is a solution unworthy of Australians. We should aim for a better and more humane outcome.
<p> Then lets just give it back to the aboriginal peoples who are entitled to it.
<p> What's your point?
<p> If Aboriginies had the technology to repel the white invader 200 years they would have used it. Aboriginal people fought to protect their land and expel the white fella from it , for which I don't criticise them one bit.
<p> Past injustices cannot be used as some sort of hand wringing justification for stupid present day policy. Germany is not expected to be hidebound by its past...there is no reason Australia should be.
<p> Look at Australia. Now look at Britain. Tell me who has the best immigration system? Would you rather like in Bradford or Brisbane?
<p> Britain has a long history of admitting people to work. People were brought here to work in textile mills. More recently, I think people are arriving to do jobs that the indigenous population consider beneath them, or jobs that pay worse than being on benefits. We should be raising the wages and getting the indigenous population off their arses to do these jobs, instead of importing cheap labour. Globalisation of the labour market has been a capitalists dream, along with subsidisation of wages by benefits, which enables business owners to pay wages that are insufficient to live on.
<p> Reading an interview of an Afgan refugee that now has the privelidge. Yes priviliedge of Australian PR - does not give much deterant to others.
<p> There is no right for anyold person to come waltzing into Austrralia and presume they have the right to stay there. I know people that did everything in their powre to get an aussie visa but were declined. They should of just jumped on a boat and come the easy way.
<p> The greens, another bunch of mad cap loonies want even more immigrants(illegal) to come to Australia by upping the amount to 'refugees' that are allowed in. Refugees that have travelled fhrough India, thaland, indoneseia and a few other countries to withan eye on Australian - streets paved in gold and a free handout.
<p> Now the soft UK may love attracting illegal immigrants from afar but i think the australian government should get tough. When I say tough I mean really tough - this is the only way to tackly this proble,
<p> Failure to get tough will result australia becooming similarly overun with illegals as the UK.
<p> Keeping asylum seekers out until/unless their case is heard and they are deemed to be in genuine danger in their home country, and therefore justified in claiming asylum, is absolutely fair. Why even have a system if people can just land illegally and be allowed to remain?
<p> We need some more Australian grit in our immigration policy. Say no to economic migration! (Unless you have a labour shortage, when it is useful; for example the US should permit more legal immigration because it has quite a big demand for casual labour.)
<p> Have a read, educate yourself, and don't mouth off about a situation you have no knowledge or understanding of.
<p> Which countries are these asylum seekers fleeing persecution from? Like many asylum seekers arriving in the UK, they stop off in a number of other countries along the way (Indonesia and Malaysia in particular). Why do they not seek asylum at their first port of call? They are not persecuted in Indonesia or Malaysia, so why head for Australia?
<p> Stick all the Australian economic migrants on Burrow Island near Portsmouth (also known as Rat Island) and process them there before deporting them. Listen for the howls of protest from the Australian government. Good idea Ms Gillard?
<p> Membership of a nation is by and large based upon birthplace. If you are born in a nation, you are generally granted citzenship. If you are born outside you might be let in and given membership. In the case of Australia, birth grants privilege. It is all down to chance in the world birth lottery that for most of us is the most important lottery we are ever to participate (if that is the word) in.
<p> So in many ways the Australians are merely protecting a birthright or lottery win depending on your view.
<p> The counter-argument is that they should share it. They do - by allowing thousands of immigrants to gain citizenship by legimiate means. This raises the question: is the plight of someone arriving in a boat escaping tyrany and oppression not legitimate? The answer for most Australians (judging from press and forum) is yes. They are not heartless, but they do insist on truth and they are pragmatic. So many ask (and you can read them asking aloud in daily columns and blogs) if someone travels across half the world to get to Aussie and passes through many other nations where they could have stopped and where the oppression (if they were so escaping it) would have ended, then why did they push onto Australia?
<p> Offshore processing is inhumane, and was a resounding failure of policy, process and basic human compassion the last time around.

<p> Today, I'm ashamed to be Australian.
<p> =======================
<p> Get real man. Australia takes in its fair share of migrants from ALL OVER the world.
<p> Why should we be obliged to take in boat loads of chancers that have no intention of doing thingt he proper way.
<p> You can't put the genie back in the bottle, so I guess letting it out slowly maybe isn't such a bad thing? There's more than one Australian politician who has looked at various European countries and been able to see what not to do.
<p> I know a few British tradesmen who wished Britain had been a bit more careful with border control, as they're now struggling to compete with eastern european competition who operate with much lower overheads (by sharing accomodation youth hostel style etc) and less 'clarity' when it comes to paying tax etc, and whilst there are a lot of those who have come from E.Europe who work, pay tax etc, there seem to be quite a few provincial high streets where something less productive could be seen to be going on.
<p> Unfortunately John Howard's medieval pratices did decrease the numbers of boats arriving on Aussie shores... or at least a lot of people in Australia certainly perceive it that way, which will always have it's supporters as opposed to allowing any and all boats to be processed at great cost to the Australian taxpayer.
<p> However, there was a similar outcry regarding the arrival of Vietnamese asylum seekers in the '70s, and now there's a lot of goodwill shown towards the hardworking communities that they developed in places like Marickville.
<p> Rather than high unemployment and a double-dip recession, Australia's got a higher skills shortage, lower unemployment, and a growing economy, leading to higher wages and living costs: every country has to deal with problems, some seem better than others.
<p> if someone travels across half the world to get to Aussie and passes through many other nations where they could have stopped and where the oppression (if they were so escaping it) would have ended, then why did they push onto Australia?
<p> ----------------------
<p> They push on because they either think that the streets are paved with gold or have been told that they will get free handouts and benifits or going there to live in a 'free society'. Maybe they are mis-informed who knows.
<p> "Regardless if these asylum seekers are political or economic refugees, In my mind the fact that they've shown the courage and grit it takes to undertake such a perilous journey to a country like Australia marks them out as determined high-achievers with excellent problem-solving skills, just the kind of people the country should want as immigrants. "
<p> Of course many countries do want a number of such people with those attributes, but they expect them to apply legally.
<p> Perhaps the illegal immigrants should apply their courage and grit in their own countries, or one of the many countries they have passed through.
<p> Stick all the Australian economic migrants on Burrow Island near Portsmouth (also known as Rat Island) and process them there before deporting them. Listen for the howls of protest from the Australian government. Good idea Ms Gillard?
<p> I wasn't aware that any of them entered the UK illegally or tried to overstay. Still, don't let the facts get in the way of your rant.
<p> remove ourselves from international obligation to take these people towing back the boats to where they came from increase jail time on smugglers. send the migrants to some remote island to be detained until they go home. Deny international aid to countries that are sending these people punish any business that employs illegals,(taking the business off them - so serious that people will really think twice about empoloying) ensure renting can only be done with the proper papers etc..
<p> provide incentive to illegals staying to come forward and be reptriated etc...
