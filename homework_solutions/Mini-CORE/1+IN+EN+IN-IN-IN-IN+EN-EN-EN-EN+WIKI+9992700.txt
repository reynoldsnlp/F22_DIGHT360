<p> Umi Matsuzaki is a 16-year-old student at Isogo High School living in Coquelicot Manor , a boarding house overlooking the Port of Yokohama in Japan. Her mother Ryoko is a medical professor studying abroad in the United States. Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings Sora and Riku and her grandmother, Hana. College student Sachiko Hirokouji and doctor-in-training Miki Hokuto also live there. Each morning, Umi raises a set of signal flags with the message "I pray for safe voyages".
<p> One day, a poem about the flags being raised by a local girl is published in the school newspaper. Shun Kazama, the poem's author and a member of the journalism club, witnesses the flags from sea as he rides a tugboat to school. At school, Umi meets Shun when he participates in a daredevil stunt for the newspaper, leaving Umi with a negative first impression. Umi later accompanies Sora to obtain Shun's autograph at the Quartier Latin , an old and dilapidated building housing the high school's clubs. Umi learns that Shun publishes the school newspaper, along with Shir? Mizunuma, the school's student government president . She ends up helping on the newspaper. Later, Shun convinces the other students to renovate the building after a debate on the future of the Quartier Latin , which may be demolished. At Umi's suggestion, the female student body cooperates with the other students.
<p> Back at Coquelicot Manor , Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men. One of these men is her deceased father Y?ichir? Sawamura, who was killed in the Korean War . Shun is stunned to see the photograph. At home that night, he opens a notebook to reveal he has a duplicate of Umi's photograph. He questions his father, who reveals that Y?ichir? arrived at their house one evening with a young Shun, shortly after the end of World War II . The Kazamas had recently lost their infant, so they adopted Shun. Upon discovering that he is avoiding her, Umi eventually confronts Shun, who reveals they may be siblings. Having checked the city records, Shun discovers that both their names are in the Sawamura family registry. Umi is able to hide her feelings from Shun, and they continue as friends.
<p> When the renovation of the Quartier Latin is complete, the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education decides to proceed with the building's demolition. The students nominate Shun, Umi, and Shir? to visit Tokyo and meet with Tokumaru, a businessman and the school board's chairman. The trio travels through the city, which is in preparation for the 1964 Summer Olympics , and successfully convince Tokumaru to visit the Quartier Latin . As Shir? leaves the group, Umi professes her love to Shun, and he reciprocates her feelings in spite of their situation.
<p> After she returns home, Umi discovers that her mother has returned. Ryoko reveals that Shun's father was Hiroshi Tachibana - the second man in the photograph. In 1945, Tachibana was killed in an accident on a repatriation ship. Shun's mother died in childbirth, and his other relatives were killed in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki . However, Ryoko was unable to raise Shun, as she was pregnant with Umi during her time as a medical student. Y?ichir? registered the child as his own to avoid leaving Shun as an orphan in the confused postwar years , but Shun was eventually given to a local couple, the Kazamas. Umi, however, still has concerns.
<p> Tokumaru later visits the Quartier Latin and, impressed by the students' efforts in renovating the building, he decides to abandon the demolition. Umi and Shun are soon summoned to the harbor. They meet Yoshio Onodera, now a ship's captain, who was the third man in the photograph, and the sole survivor of the three. Confirming that Umi and Shun are not related by blood, Onodera tells the full story of the three naval men in the previous era. With everything resolved, Umi returns to Coquelicot Manor and resumes her daily routine of raising the flags, but without the answering flag.

<p> In the film, Umi's father was killed when his supply ship was sunk by mines in the Korean War, and Shun's biological father died aboard a repatriation vessel after the end of the Second World War.
<p> Following Japan's defeat in the Second World War, the Supreme Commander Allied Powers (SCAP) assumed control over the Japanese merchant marine to return repatriates to their homelands. At the start of the Korean War, those ships, together with their Japanese crews, were pressed into service by the US military to carry forces and supplies to Korea. Japanese vessels played a significant role at the Incheon and Wonsan landings. The shipping firm Tozai Kisen was among the most prominent firms involved, concluding "an agreement with the US militarys Japan Logistical Command (JLC) to provide 122 small vessels and around 1,300 crew for transport and landing work." [ 12 ]
<p> "Japanese workers were being recruited both via the Japanese governments official procurements program and through companies like Tozai Kisen to unload supplies, repair equipment and carry out other military support duties for UN/US bases in Korea during the War. These workers were confined either within the bases or on Japanese cargo vessels which had been specially modified for use as floating barracks and were moored in Korean ports. An article published by the Asahi Shimbun in January 1953 reported that there were thought to be about 1000 Japanese labour recruits still engaged in this work in Korea at that time. According to an estimate by Japans Special Procurement Agency, 56 Japanese sailors and labourers were killed in the Korean War zone in the first six months of the war alone; 23 of the deaths occurred when Japanese-crewed ships were sunk by mines. No official estimate of the total number of Japanese killed in the Korean War has ever been published, indeed, there has never been official recognition by the US or Japanese governments of the role of Japanese in the war zone."

<p> Gor? Miyazaki initially researched Yokohama, intending to be faithful to the city's historical details. However, after realizing that "simply re-enacting something of the time may seem real enough but may not necessarily be beautiful." Miyazaki decided to show the location as "shimmering and bustling with life" from the viewpoint of the characters. [ 20 ] In designing the Quartier Latin , Miyazaki worked with the art directors who added ideas about the "amalgamation of clutter in the houses many rooms" and attempted to "look at the architecture of the building, but to also remember back to my college years and the clutter and filthiness that [Miyazaki] lived through."

[ 40 ] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the film "a time-machine dream of a not-so-distant past, a sweet and honestly sentimental story that also represents a collaboration between the greatest of Japanese animators and his up-and-coming son."

On the characterizations, Turan stated, "the respect and politeness with which all the characters, even the teenage protagonists, treat one another is a far cry from what can go on in this day and age."
