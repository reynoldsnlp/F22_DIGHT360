<p> I've seen a lot of political "attack ads" this last few weeks. If you've turned on the TV, checked your mail, or answered your phone, you've probably seen them too.
<p> I'm sick of them at this point, but I stopped the other day to think about why I'm sick of them. What bothers me about them?
<p> The way I see it, there are two major problems with them -- and I think there's one relatively simple solution to both problems.
<h> The First Problem -- Caricaturization
<p> We've talked about this before, but suffice it to say that if you think that the poor are lazy, or that the rich are greedy, those are caricatures.
<p> Politicians deal primarily with caricatures for a couple of reasons. The first is because it's just easier than dealing with the nuances of reality. People like things wrapped up in neat little packages, and caricatures do that. The second is that common enemies unite people almost as well as a common goal. If all poor people are lazy, or all rich people are greedy, it's easier for the other side to hate them.
<p> The problem is that caricatures aren't reality. Sure, there are lazy poor people. Yes, there are greedy rich people. But there are also hard-working poor people, and extremely generous rich people. While we're at it, there are greedy poor people and lazy rich people too.
<p> The problem with these political caricatures is that they're polarizing. The real world isn't the hard-working poor vs. the greedy rich, or the lazy poor vs. the hard-working upper classes -- it's somewhere in the middle. But if we never actually go meet the people who are part of our personal villified groups, our perceptions are never going to change.
<p> Trust me, it's a heck of a lot harder to caricaturize somebody when you're looking them in the eye.
<h> The Second Problem -- Exclusively Vote-Based Solutions
<p> Let me be clear on this -- I don't mean that government can't be a part of solving some of our problems. There are definitely things that government is in a good position to do, and some things that government is almost uniquely qualified to do. Because of that, we should vote for elected officials whose values are in line with our own.
<p> But it's really easy to cast a vote and believe you've done something, when you haven't. You've voted, which is a good thing to do -- but a vote by itself doesn't change anything. The vote needs to be accompanied by action.
<p> And whose actions can we control? If you're a long-time reader of this blog, you know my answer to that question -- each of us can only control our own actions. So it's up to us!
<h> A Couple Easy Ways You Can Help
<p> Giving money is relatively easy for most people, so I'm going to list it first. There are two organizations I would urge you to consider, depending on your political leanings.
<p> If you're the sort of person who has no problem making an outright donation to those less fortunate, Charity: Water (link to my friend Amanda 's Charity: Water campaign) is an organization that's working to make sure people around the world have access to clean, safe drinking water. If you're a Christian and would prefer to donate to a faith-based organization, The Last Well is very similar to Charity: Water.
<p> Both organizations are doing awesome things.
<p> If you're the sort of person who believes people need to seize opportunity and work hard to pay their own way, check out Kiva . Kiva allows you to lend small amounts of money (as little as $25) to various people all around the world that are looking to start or expand a business. When the money is repaid, it shows up back in your Kiva account. You can then withdraw it, donate it to Kiva, or re-lend it.
<p> You aren't paid interest when you make a loan through Kiva, and there's always a small risk that you'll lose your money -- but their repayment rate is almost 99%, so your risk is negligible. There are even "guaranteed repayment" loans if you're a stickler for that sort of thing -- check their site for more details.
<p> Of course the list above isn't even close to complete, and it doesn't really matter what you do.
<p> What matters is that we take the "we" out of our statements, and swap it with an "I". If I say that we need to do something about poverty, I should be the one going and doing something about it.
<h> The Ultimate Solution
<p> Solutions to problems are almost always "both/and", not "either/or". We need public policy to reflect what we want, but we also need to be   doing something about the problem ourselves.
<p> It's not "either we help the unemployed family next door, or we vote for a politician who promises to increase employment". It's both. Cast the vote, then invite that family next door over for dinner. Or give them a ride to the store. Or watch their kid while they look for a job.
<p> The "what" doesn't matter nearly as much -- taking action is the big thing.
<p> And if you have any good ideas for things people can do to make the world a little better place, (particularly things that are easy, but just need to be done!), I'd love to hear them in the comments!

<p> Consider signing up to be a blood donor, an organ donor, or a marrow donor. If your young and healthy, particularly.
<p> Kiva's a great site -- with $250 of seed money (payed in over the course of a year) I've made more than 50 loans over time! When I'm employed again, I intend to grow that seed money pool further.
<p> Be there for your friends when they need you. It sounds obvious, but friendship is more than hanging out during good times; it's also being supportive when it's hard and offering time, money, or assistance to the best of your means. A real friend will do the same for you, and a toxic friend will quickly become apparent in such an environment of mutual assistance.
<p> I used to keep a few cans of pop-top soup in the car, to give to the homeless who touched my heart. There's a lot of complication in giving money at street corners, and no certainty that they need it. With a gift of healthy food, you can be sure you're giving them a meal. Money can often be used better (and with more certainty of helping those with actual need) by organizations, but even those without dire need can use a meal. You also quickly learned which street-corner dwellers didn't want anything that wasn't cash, and could avoid them for the hucksters they were.)
<p> Smile in public.
<p> Be patient with service workers! Waiters, check-out staff, and so many others come across your path every day. Your frustration can ruin their day, as well. Don't let it! Smile even when you're in a hurry, and don't fly off the handle at honest mistakes. Shadlyn Wolfe recently posted.. Excerpt: Fragile Reality
