<h> lyrics
<p> Like the things we don't have names for you're the dirt that makes the ground Like a broken vacuum cleaner you just push the dirt around Oh let's not fight we don't have all night You're right, you be the bait, I'll be the bite
<p> You'll be the dictator I'll be the oppressed You'll be the third world and I'll be the West You'll be the last giant panda bear I'll be the last giant panda bear sperm You'll be the baby bird and I'll be the regurgitated worms
<p> You'll be the shooter girl and I'll be the bar You'll be the frat boy I'll be the guitar You'll be the lost kid at the zoo I'll be the ice cream on your chin You'll be the newborn baby looking for a way back in
<p> Thank God that I've got the things that I've got But a lot of things I've got are things I never knew I needed til I met you and you taught me a thing or two about things Things like love and buildings, things like death and happy birthday cake Things like how to give and never take Things like the things that people make
<p> You'll be construction and I'll be destruction You'll be the worker I'll be the means of production You'll be the leftist student punk I'll be the accountant you'll become You'll be the minivan I'll be the jeans you think make you look young
<p> Thank God that I've got the things that I've got But a lot of things I've got are things I never knew I needed til I met you and you taught me a thing or two about things Things like love and buildings, things like death and happy birthday cake Things like how to give and never take Things like the things that people make

<h> about
<p> The Burning Hell is the alter-ego of ukulele player and all-purpose nerd Mathias Kom. While the band can occasionally bloom into a multi-instrumental monster with members all across Canada and Europe, The Burning Hell is now happily based in St. John's, Newfoundland. The essence of The Burning Hell is music to dance to while laughing about death and smiling out of the side of your mouth. ... more
