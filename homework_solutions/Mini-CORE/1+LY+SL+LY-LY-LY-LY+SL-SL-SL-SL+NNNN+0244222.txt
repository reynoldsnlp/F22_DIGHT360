<h> Avant Seems To Be lyrics
<p> I was sixteen with a mind of my own You were Seventeen and you thought you was grown I found a thrill when we went up a hill And you ues to feel me, my body would get chills I picked you up in my 89 Chevy I brought you candy and popcorn at the movies I had it made when I, got paid And we, go roller skate, but every thing has changed, Wait Seems to be to me, something wrong with this household Seems to be to me, you're always trying to take control Seems to be to me, something wrong with the kissing Seems to be to me, something is missing Seems to be to me, something wrong with the making love Seems to be to me, you forgot what love was Seemsto be to me something wrong kissing Seems to be to me, something is missing [Avant] We had fun that year that you turned 21 You were my world cause you brought me my baby girl She so fine and she's all mine AndI promised to love you until the end of time [Olivia] That's ok cause I felt the same way But you're running game and that's when everything changed The phone calls and your two ways and your attitude You wated too many pimp tapes After all of the things that we been througth I'm still willing to take care of you Girl we been together for so long And I just want to know, What's going on? Seems to be to me, something wrong with this household Seems to be to me, you're always trying to take contrl Seems to be to me, something wrong with the kissing Seems to be to me, you forgot what love was Seems to be to me, something wroong with the kissing Seems to be tome, something is missing What happen to kissing and hugging? Insteadof all that cussingand fussing, I wanna know right now, what you got to say, What happen to respecting me? Instead of spending time in the street I don't need to know; in fact I got to go Wait baby let me plead my case I got a faw more things to say Shit is making me made, girl what I do so bad? What about that girl you sending money to down the way? What about, you been cheating on me she had your baby? What about, the lies and deceit I face day to day? What about, I don't feel the way I used to I lost my faith in you? Seemd to be to me, something wrong with this household Seems to be to me, you're always trying to take control Seems to be to me, something wrong with kissing Seems to be to me, something missing Seems to be to me, something wrong with the making love Seems to be to me, you forgot what love was Seems to be to me, something wrong with the kissing Seems to be to me, something is missing Back to Avant lyrics
