<p> When the lights go down in the city, getting real low Settling in my room, I'm unnoticed When the still comes in through my window letting me go I feel calm, come over me, on the floor
<p> On the floor Where the rats all come away clean There on the floor Where the children all stomp and scream straight out the door Well, I find myself on my knees, begging please
<p> When the lights go down in the city and everyone goes, to their room [| From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/b/brandon-fl\\... |] Walking their trail to dreamland When the lights go down in the city, something is roaring I find myself waiting to believe
<p> On the floor Where the mice call shots in the corner, that's where I'll be When the crickets come home and sing their symphony 'Til I find myself on my knees, begging please
<p> On the floor Facing the things I've done here on the floor Where the years have gathered and run that's where I'll be And I find myself on my knees, begging please
