<h> Early life and beginnings
<p> Gary Barlow was born on 20 January 1971 in Frodsham , Cheshire , the second son of Colin and Marjorie Barlow. [ 16 ] In Barlow's autobiography, he relates that his love of music began at an early age.
<p> "I was one of those kids that's forever dancing in front of the TV looking at my reflection." [ 17 ]
<p> He cites watching a performance of " Just Can't Get Enough " by Depeche Mode on Top of the Pops when he was ten years old as a main influence of his love of music, describing it as 'mesmerising'. Barlow subsequently asked for a keyboard for Christmas. He spent most of his spare time teaching himself to play his favourite songs. [ 18 ]
<p> He has credited Elton John with inspiring him to play the piano. [ 19 ]
<p> In 1986, when Barlow was fifteen years old, he entered a BBC Pebble Mill at One Christmas song competition with "Let's Pray For Christmas". After reaching the semi-finals, he was invited to London's West Heath Studios to record his song. This inspired Barlow to perform on the northern club circuit, singing cover versions and his own songs. Barlow's first performance was at the Connah's Quay Labour Club in the late '80s and he was paid 18 per performance on Saturday evenings. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
<p> In 1989, he appointed Wigan show business agent Barry Woolley to be his manager and recorded a single ("Love Is in the Air") which was never released commercially. Barlow was eventually put in touch with casting agent Nigel Martin-Smith , by renowned celebrity photographer Michael Braham, who took Barlow's first professional head-shots. Nigel is a friend of Michael's, and introduced Barlow to Nigel who was interested in starting a boyband. Martin-Smith decided to use Barlow as the lead-singer after being impressed by his self written material including an early demo tape of Barlow's " A Million Love Songs " concluding that the band will be built around Barlow's vocals and songwriting skills.
<p> Barlow received an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song in 1994 for the number 1 hit song " Pray " included on the album. [ 25 ] In 1994, alongside Rick Astley , Barlow did backing vocals for Elton John 's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King . Their third album Nobody Else , again based on Barlow's own material, went straight to number 1 and was to be their last studio album of the 90s. The album had three number 1 singles, including Barlow's " Back for Good " which peaked at number 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 [ 26 ] and was brought forward an unprecedented 6 weeks before its official release such was the demand for the single. [ 27 ] A Greatest Hits collection followed again reaching number 1. The album featured the band's eighth number 1 single " How Deep Is Your Love ". This was to be the first single released by Take That as a four piece (without Robbie Williams) and it was their last single until they reformed in 2005.
<h> 2005-present: Reunion
<p> Barlow returned to the limelight in a successful TV documentary, Take That: For the Record in 2005. Following this success and renewed interest, Take That experienced a career renaissance in 2005 when the post-Williams line-up reformed for a sell-out stadium tour. The band released their comeback single "Patience" which went to number 1 for four weeks while also topping the charts across Europe. Patience was also voted The Record of the Year in 2006 and won a Brit for single of the year. [ 28 ] This was followed with " Shine " which became the band's tenth number 1 single.

The band also announced a stadium tour entitled Progress Live which took place in 2011. [ 33 ] The tickets for the tour went on sale on 29 October 2010. Due to unprecedented high public demand for tickets, ticketmaster websites across the UK and Ireland crashed and all initial tour dates sold out in under 15 minutes. [ 34 ] It was reported that a record breaking one million tickets were snapped up on the first day of sale, resulting in Take That smashing the previous box office record of tickets sold which was set in 2008 by Take That Present: The Circus Live . [ 35 ] Due to unprecedented demand Take That added more dates to their tour, finishing in the UK with a record breaking 8 consecutive nights at Wembley Stadium after which the tour will then commence throughout Europe with an estimated 1.75million people expected to attend the shows.

<p> In October 2013, Barlow traveled directly from the X Factor live results shows to Afghanistan to meet the Armed Forces and experience their day-to-day lives in Camp Bastion . Barlow listened to the soldiers' stories, went for a five-kilometre run with the troops and played a morale-boosting concert for them as a thank you for their incredible hard work. [ 112 ]
<p> On 12 November 2013, Barlow sang with Agnetha Faltskog who was singing live on stage for the first time in 25 years. It was at the BBC Children In Need Rocks concert in London which Barlow organised. [ 113 ]
<h> Personal life
<p> In 2000 Barlow married Dawn Andrews, who was a dancer on their 1995 Nobody Else Tour. They have three children, Daniel (born 2000), Emily (born 2002) and Daisy (born 2009). On 19 February 2012, Barlow announced that he and his wife Dawn were expecting their fourth child. [ 114 ] On August 4, 2012 Barlow stated that their daughter, named Poppy, had been delivered stillborn. [ 115 ]
<p> Barlow released a short statement reading "Dawn and I are devastated to announce that we've lost our baby. Our focus now is giving [Poppy] a beautiful funeral and loving our three children with all our hearts. We'd ask at this painful time that our privacy be respected". Despite the loss of his daughter one week previously, Barlow performed at the London 2012 Olympic Games Closing Ceremony singing the hit " Rule the World " which drew praise internationally for the strength and determination of Barlow to take to the stage so soon after his tragedy. [ 116 ] Owing to the bereavement, it was announced that Barlow would not attend the X Factor press launch. [ 117 ] And also Barlow decided to stay in London rather than fly to anywhere else in the world for X factor judges houses to be close to his family .
<p> In 2009, Barlow named " Don't Give Up ", the 1986 duet between Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush , as the song that had most inspired him. He said: "I don't think you can listen to this song without feeling inspired, it could save anybody. The lyrics are so inspirational. Specifically I was having a very low moment in the 1990s and the song came on the radio. There have only been a very few times when I've had to pull the car over to listen to a song - this was one of them." [ 118 ]
<p> Barlow's father Colin died aged 71 on 15 October 2009. [ 119 ] The singer rushed back to his parents' home in Frodsham , Cheshire, and cancelled an engagement to launch his celebrity-packed Children in Need show, [ 120 ] while also postponing the launch of the Take That edition of Singstar.
<p> During the 2010 General Election campaign , the Conservative Party announced their intention to encourage musical achievement amongst young people in schools with a competition called School Stars . Barlow appeared at a school staged campaign event to endorse the introduction of the programme by David Cameron . Barlow also sang Greatest Day at the event. When asked if he supported the Conservatives at the election, Barlow responded: "I would not be here if I was not." [ 121 ]
<p> In June 2012, it was revealed that along with Take That band-mates Howard Donald, Mark Owen and over 1,100 other people; Barlow had invested 26 million in music industry investment schemes. [ 122 ] The news attracted controversy when it was understood that the schemes could serve as tax shelters for wealthy people. Barlow was accused of tax avoidance rather than tax evasion , as the scheme itself is not illegal. Barlow's lawyer responded to the claims, stating he "paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises". On 10 May 2014 a judge ruled that the scheme was setup for the purpose of avoiding tax, with the scheme generating losses of 336 million to enable Barlow and others to offset these losses against the taxes they were liable to pay from their other earnings. HMRC indicated that they would be pursuing Barlow for repayment of the taxes that he and others had sought to avoid paying. [ 123 ]
