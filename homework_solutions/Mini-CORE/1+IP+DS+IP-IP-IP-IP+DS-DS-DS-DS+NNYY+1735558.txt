<h> How to choose and use eye-catching photographs for your marketing
<h> Did you know that using the wrong photographs (or not using any photos at all) could be costing you sales?
<p> Have you ever struggled to find decent photos for your marketing materials -- and decided it was so hard, you wouldn't bother? Or perhaps you took your own photo with your digital camera?
<h> Is the impact of your marketing suffering because the photos you're using aren't quite right?
<p> Like it or not, in business we all get judged on appearances. So if your prospect is looking at your marketing materials but has never met you, they'll be judging your business based on what they see in front of them, be it online or in print. That means that every little detail takes on a huge significance: the design, the spelling, punctuation and grammar... and also the visual imagery.
<p> That's where the photographs come in; they provide visual imagery. It's a tricky area though, because if you choose the wrong photograph it can:
<p> Alienate your prospects if you've used unappealing images.
<p> Make your service or product look cheap if you've taken your own photographs (and you're not a trained photographer).
<p> Attract the wrong kind of prospects (which then fail to convert, because they're not your target market).
<h> Think you can get round this by not using any photos at all?
<p> Well, marketing materials with just words and no photos are boring. Lots of words (without pictures) are visually daunting, so many prospects won't even begin to read your marketing materials. Photos have a vital role to play in attracting attention.
<p> In short: choosing the right kind of photograph is very, very important.
<h> But trying to figure out what kind of photographs you should use in your marketing can be so baffling!
<p> What makes the task of selecting photographs so baffling is that the job is not straightforward: what should the photograph be of? Where can you find such a photo? Can you even afford such a photograph? And once you have it, how do you place it in your layout so that you project the right kind of image?
<p> Visual imagery is such an important part of marketing, yet it's something that many small business owners struggle with. So unless you want to engage a graphic designer to do this task for you, most small business owners will either (a) give up on trying to find a suitable photograph, or (b) make do with something that isn't quite right.
<p> If you think that your visual imagery is letting you down -- or you're confused as to what you should be using the first place, then this ebook is for you.
<p> This ebook will give you confidence in how to select photographs for your marketing.
<h> How to choose and use eye-catching photographs for your marketing
<p> This is a book that'll show you what kind of photographs are good for marketing... because what makes an attractive photograph, isn't necessarily a photograph that'll bring in sales. There are some very specific things that a marketing photograph needs to have, and in this book you'll discover what to look for.
<h> But where do you find these ideal photographs?
<p> There are numerous places where you can find good marketing photographs: and these sources range from free, to low cost, to high priced. So whether you've got a tiny budget or are keen to spend good money on some unique photography, this book will point you in the right direction.
<h> Sourcing a photograph is only the start of it...
<p> Once you've got the photograph, knowing how to use it in your layout can make all the difference. The book will give you plenty of simple, workable ideas that you can incorporate onto your web page, brochure, newsletter, blog post, or whatever it is you're working on.
<p> How do you know if the photograph you've chosen is a good marketing photo or not?
<p> Which qualities make a good marketing photograph?
<p> And how should you lay out that photograph?
<p> With this book, you will have confidence in choosing and using photographs for your marketing:
<p> Reason 1 : it gives you specific things to look for when choosing a photograph.
<p> Reason 2: there's even a checklist of these things, so you can refer to a summary every time you're sourcing images.
<p> Reason 3: it contains some little-known research on marketing photography that most people don't know about, allowing you to keep a step ahead of your competitors.
<h> So what's in the photography book? And how can it help you?
<p> Here's just a tiny preview of what's in 'How to choose and use eye-catching photographs for your marketing'...
<p> The Mona Lisa Effect: in most advertising and marketing photography the model is looking right at you. While this is a powerful technique for magazine covers, you'll learn why such photographs are a poor choice for most other products and services.
<p> Tapping into emotions: if you want your marketing piece to get noticed, it should have some kind of emotional connection with the view. But should the photograph draw on negative, harrowing emotions -- or should they appeal to the reader's hopes and aspirations? Find out which is better and why.
<p> Photograph captions: most people don't bother writing captions for photographs on their website, blog, newsletter or brochure. Find out why this is a HUGE wasted opportunity. And you'll also discover some inventive ways of adding words to your images.
<p> File formats: finally, a non-technical but very helpful explanation as to what JPEG, GIF and PNG files are all about! And find out why the requirements for printed photographs are different to online photographs. And should you need to edit your files, the book points you towards some very powerful but cost-effective (and free) image editing software.
<p> Sourcing photos when you're on a tight budget: having a zero (or close-to-zero) budget is no excuse for not using photographs. You'll find out where you can find free photographs (legally), as well as low-cost sources of stock photographs. Then, if you choose your photographs wisely, you can make your images go a very long way indeed.
<p> Portrait photo longevity: most business owners need a portrait shot of themselves. Instead of dreading this experience, you'll learn some hints and tips on getting great results. Most importantly, you'll discover how to give your portrait photograph longevity: after all, you don't really want to get a new one every year or two. So find out how to make your portrait shot as long-lasting as possible.
<p> How to add drama to your layouts: a photograph is only as good as the way its laid out in your marketing piece. There are some easy tricks to help your photo stand out, be it through size, borders or angling. You'll discover how you can apply these techniques yourself, and there's a swipe file of layout ideas you can refer to.
<p> Idea swipe file: the book is packed with examples and layouts. So whether you do your own layout work, or want to show your graphic designer what you have in mind, there are oodles of ideas to get you inspired.
<h> "I wasn't sure if the book would teach me things I did not already know"
<p> "I was able to use some tips immediately on my website." - Neal Battaglia
<p> "Before I got Cornelia's book, I thought I knew the basics of imagery, especially digital because of my work experiences and time using images online, wasn't quite sure if the book would teach me things I did not already know.
<p> Cornelia reminds us of what we knew when we were three years old, that pictures can capture interest far better than printed words many times.  She goes the finer details of using imagery and making images more effective.  I was able to use some tips immediately on my website.
<p> The thoroughness of the topics was my favorite part of the book.  While I do know some basics, the book gets into details I might have forgotten or tend to overlook.
<p> The resources given in the book and how to use the resources were very helpful.  Showing how to use a single image in several ways was interesting and I think will be useful.  Seeing examples of problems and thinking to where I might have made mistakes she mentions made me take action on some of my own projects.
<p> I would highly recommend this book for anyone who communicates on the web or print since images capture attention and connect with people with a different sense than our interpretation of printed words.  It will help you think about when to use images and how to use them in order to communicate more effectively and reach people in a deeper way."
<p> 1. Structured explanations: each chapter builds on the knowledge you've gained in previous chapters. The book takes you on a journey in a logical order. That's why you'll learn about choosing photographs first of all, before you go on to discover how you can use them.
<p> 2. Example photographs: there are dozens and dozens of photographs all through the book, used to explain the points. A picture really does tell a thousand words!
<p> 3. Example layouts: seeing individual photographs is great, but seeing photographs being used is even more powerful. That's when you'll really get inspired and enthused about using photographs in your marketing!
<p> 4. Summary checklist: all the most important points are summarised at the end of the book in a checklist format. That way, you can easily work through the checklist whenever you're sourcing photographs for your marketing, or working on a layout.
<h> What's different about 'How to choose and use eye-catching photographs for your marketing'?
<p> Most other books on photography are aimed at amateur photographers who want to improve their photography skills, or at graphic designers who already have some technical knowledge. There are few books available that are specifically written for small business owners -- and with a marketing/sales angle. This book is especially for those with zero knowledge of photography or graphic design. (And even if you do have some knowledge in these areas, there are lots of extra secrets to choosing and using photographs for your marketing.)
<p> It's not just about eye-catching photographs, but about effective photographs. That means photographs that will get noticed and remembered, so that your message is retained, recalled and acted upon. It's not just about pretty pictures, it's about making a difference to how your company is perceived by your customers and prospects.
<h> "I assumed that an occasional picture or image was all I needed on my websites"
<p> "As a small business owner, I often think about making more sales and "doing the work" of the business. Before I read Cornelia's book, I assumed that an occasional picture or image was all I needed to show on my websites. When I started creating websites, I was very cheap and stark about how I used photographs. I didn't realize what options I could use to increase the attention of my visitors by using photographs. Yes, photographs. And especially why photographs compared to other types of images.
<p> Photographs are real slices of life. Magazines use photographs. Catalogs use photographs. Newspapers use photographs. Why? Why photographs?
<p> I think the reason is that people love looking at photographs. People look at photographs and imagine themselves in the picture. Photographs engage our emotions and make us aspire to something better. People buy products and inquire about services by looking at a photograph. A good, interesting, compelling photograph that is. And Cornelia shows you what a good, compelling, and interesting photograph is. How to choose that photograph. How to use that photograph. For marketing -- to get orders and sales and to increase your business.
<p> There are a number of things I like about this book. First of all, Cornelia uses real life photographs -- good photographs and poor photographs to show -- and contrast -- the differences. She explains where to source photographs, what to look for when planning a web site or marketing literature, and how to use that photograph for maximum effect. Her illustration of the Non-Mona Lisa Effect was enlightening, especially when she combines it with the role of the photograph to look into the center of the page.
<p> I took dozens of notes and highlighted key sections in the PDF version of this book. For example, knowing how to search for the availability of copy space and white backgrounds are tips that will help me establish criteria for choosing photos more wisely. There is much, much more practical and easy to understand advice and wisdom that Cornelia gives you in this book.
<p> I learned some things about Cornelia that I did not know. I knew that Cornelia was a marketing consultant, with the appropriate education and real-life experience. But I did not know that she was a City and Guilds qualified photographer. I did not know that she has such a discerning eye to distinguish between the correct choice and use of photos. She walks the marketing talk and has the credibility to offer you the information in this book. And, she makes it very easy to understand. If I can "get" it, you can too.
<p> I recommend this book to those starting off in marketing products or services, or those who would like to make their visual appeal more effective. Photographs are like a mint, one coin at a time. One coin, one investment in your marketing. One investment in your products and service can enrich the lives of your customers. Buy this book today!"
<h> Do you really need a book on marketing photography?
<p> With digital cameras and the internet providing such a ready supply of photographs, do you really need to buy a book on marketing photography?
<p> Well, yes, actually... if you want your marketing photographs to get noticed (for the right reasons) and to make more sales.
<p> As you'll see from the Testimonials on this page, the book is full of little-known techniques that are super easy to use. Even other marketing professionals and photographers don't know all of these techniques. Which is exactly why I wrote this book, so that you, the small business owner, have all the resources at your fingertips.
<p> Let's see what Juliet Fay, a copywriter in Wales (UK) has to say about the book...
<h> "As I don't have a design background I wasn't sure how much one book could really help me"
<p> "It's clear the author is deeply knowledgeable on her subject but also completely understands the realities of running a small business." - Juliet Fay
<p> "As a copywriter, I'm very focused on the words that create sales messages for my clients. I generally leave graphics to professional designers but in common with all small businesses I need to make my own marketing materials as attractive as possible. As I don't have a design background I wasn't sure how much one book could really help me. Would it be the right level for me, or assume either too much or too little prior knowledge?
<p> When I read it, I felt as if Cornelia wrote the book especially for me and every other solo entrepreneur who doesn't have an in house art and design department. It is packed with so many practical tips and sound advice on everything from sourcing photographs to simple photo editing.
<p> The book takes you through the whole process of using photos in marketing materials, starting with how they can add impact to your copy. If you're like me, you'll find it fills all the gaps in your knowledge (including gaps you didn't know were there!).
<p> This is the kind of book you will keep handy on your e-book reader because you'll want to check back on the detailed advice on every aspect of photo use. The book is easy to read and that's because the author knows how to present ideas and make them stick. You'll never forget the Mona Lisa Effect (it's not what you think)!
<p> The book is crammed full of examples showing you exactly what works (and what doesn't). It also has detailed explanations of why these techniques work.
<p> It's clear the author is deeply knowledgeable on her subject but also completely understands the realities of running a small business. The advice is spot on for time pressed small business owners. The sound, impartial advice on when it's worth bringing in the professionals is invaluable for stretched budgets.
<p> If you've avoided using images in your marketing material, either because you're more of a 'words' person, or don't really think images matter or because you're unsure how to make images look professional, then this will be the best $$ you ever spent.
<p> I have an excellent and well thumbed copy of 'The Non Designers Design Book',  near my desk which I reference often. 'How to choose and use eye catching photographs for your marketing'  by Cornelia Luethi is going to be another 'must have' for non design people in business."
<h> Important reasons why you shouldn't delay
<h> #1: Perception in the marketplace
<p> Like it or not, we get judged on appearance. Likewise, your marketing materials and website will be judged on its appearance. If the website looks well-designed, attractive, and is easy to use, most users will perceive your company to be professional. On the other hand, if your website is not so attractive, full of spelling mistakes and crashes a lot, most users will perceive your company to be lacking in professionalism.
<p> It therefore makes sense that if you want to be perceived as professional, the imagery you use on your marketing materials and website looks the part!
<h> #2: Customer conversion
<p> The photographs you use in your marketing have an influence on how many readers will take action, be it an enquiry or a purchase. So if you're keen to make as many sales as possible, you should be using all the tricks in this book!
<h> #3: The knowledge will give you confidence
<p> Choosing and using photographs for your marketing can give many small business owners a headache. Selecting photographs is perceived as a time-consuming, unpleasant chore. Why? Because the choice of photographs is overwhelming when you don't know what you're looking for. But this book will show you what to look for, and even gives you a handy checklist. Easy!
<h> #4: There's no risk
<p> This ebook is 100% guaranteed for 60 days. So take your time to read through the information. And if it isn't right for you, just send me an email and I'll happily refund your money in full.
<h> #5: It's relevant to all small businesses
<p> The techniques in the book are relevant to all small businesses. Whether you're selling products or services, or you're Business-to-Business (B2B) or Business-to-Consumer (B2C), it makes no difference... the same techniques still apply! And the examples in the book apply to choosing and using photographs for the marketing of both products and services.
<h> "I thought that I knew enough about choosing photographs for my marketing materials"
<p> "What I liked most about the book was the 'before and after' example photographs that are used to illustrate every single concept." - Marina Brito
<p> "I thought that I knew enough about choosing photographs for my marketing materials. But after reading this book I found that, while I knew a fair bit already, there were several elements that I didn't know about or that I had forgotten. Learning about those key elements took my skills to the next level.
<p> What I liked most about the book was the 'before and after' example photographs that are used to illustrate every single concept. It made the concepts really easy to understand.
<p> It was also helpful to learn about free photo editing tools, and simple ways to spruce up my photographs, in particular using catch-lights and the rule-of-thirds grid for image cropping. I also learned that the Mona Lisa Effect could be costing me sales.
<p> I'd absolutely recommend this book to every business owner and/or marketer who needs to make decisions about using photography in their marketing. Even when hiring a professional firm, it is important to understand the basics and ensure that the results will be as effective as possible.
<p> Thanks for a wonderful book which will empower me to have the most effective marketing materials for my business!"
