<h> Pressure
<p> It's been a while since we last touched bases, Ever since 'State of the Art' rushed playlists, Been around the globe a couple of times, Sang in a thousand homes but none of them mine, Played a thousand shows under the lights, And walked on mountain roads touching the sky, Rocked foreign shores where I swore I had no name, That meant more than the awards and accolades, Like I can't believe we made our calling, We've barely stopped to breathe and take it all in, It's got a hold on me the day I fold and leave, It's gonna seem like I'm falling, And I buried two friends, lost touch with some others, Split with my girl, found love with another, For every road the world I know gets smaller, Came home to find my son had grown a head taller
<h> Suffa Verse 1
<p> I lay down my music ten feet from where I lay down, Immersed in them beats, short breaks turned to breakdowns, 'Cause when you work where you sleep, you don't sleep, 'Cause you work on them beats till it hurts then you creep, Into bed and wake her from her sleep, and she's hurt, Cos she worked through the week and hasn't heard not a word nor a peep, From the jerk that she keeps in her heart, That she forgives when he nurse her to sleep, word it's deep, But yo when I peel them lids back and emerge from my sleep, I feel so big that I could make a shirt from my sheet, A crown from a church steeple, two jeeps for my sneaks, So people worship this creep as I surf down the street, I'm the surgeon of beats, your girl purrs when I speak, We rehearse in a church to a circus of freaks, We the last ones to lay down, first on our feet, So stay down or get hurt by what lurks in the deep, Free the perps from the police, we disturbing the peace, We flood the streets like a water main burst and released, A merciless beast with a thirst for the feast, Man we treat every meal like it's our first in a week, We dispersing the weak, I'm the person to beat, Man I'm unbeatable; I can beat a person for weeks, We disturbed, we the freaks, we the ones you don't listen to, Drinking from the sun, now son we're the ones dissing you
<h> Chorus
<p> And we don't, we won't, We don't, and we won't let the vultures at the counter-culture, Now we don't, and we won't, We move mountains and drink from the sun
<h> Pressure Verse 2
<p> We're timeless like riders on the storm, Survivors like the light that rises in the dawn, If crisis makes fighters of the pawns, We rise up through the night as lifeless and we're born, Fight in my heart, suicide with my art, Till I depart I'm a write until I light up the dark, These are battle songs that lift you from your catatonic fixture, And I can walk on water but I stagger on the liquor, This ain't a Saturday sport or matinee talk, With throw away sentences like the magistrates' court, Scratch that, now hear me out, attacks don't give me doubt, I drop a powerhouse track black the city out, And when we lose it let the mood of music reach us, Coming through the tunes that free us, revolution through your speakers, The third rock never stops the world turns, Eyes glued to the clock as we watch the world burn
<h> Chorus
<p> And we don't, we won't, We don't, and we won't let the vultures at the counter-culture, Now we don't, and we won't, We move mountains and drink from the sun
<h> Pressure Verse 3
<p> Renegades whenever on centre stage, That's my sweat upon the letters I bled on the pen and page, C'mon, so what's your rhyming worth? Better get a lawyer 'cause, I could crucify your verse just to get a point across, We've been refining and grinding till late night, Why? 'Cause even stars lose their shine in the day light, Linked as one just think what we'll become, It's begun and won't stop till we're drinking from the sun
<h> Suffa Verse 1
<p> I'm wondering where the day went, The clouds have me shrouded in grey but, I'm still out pounding the pavement, word, Drowning the hurt by pounding rounds in brown paper, Founded a label now I'm drowning paperwork, But now the crew I'm down with found an escape from work, And I love it 'cause that what your hard work gets you, My heart bursts through my chest I'm rescued, So forget what the rest do, I'm blessed to do it with two of who are the best to do it, Do I love it?
<h> Pressure Verse 2
<p> Look at our goals, If we never stood in the cold we wouldn't evolve, Used to put my crooked foot in what I couldn't resolve, But took control now, hard work is good for my soul, And I love it, growing through life and stress, Knowing the fight is just half of self-imposing our righteousness, Contract owners and licenses, showbiz in lights we're just, Searching for that moment of pricelessness
<h> Sia Chorus
<p> B-Boys, I met you at the bus stop, We had nothing but the tuck shop, We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops, Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop I love it, I love it
<h> Suffa Verse 3
<p> Five days deep in the booth, and spent Friday leaping through loops, Then spent the weekend sideways, seeking the truth, And I won't lie they keep me on my toes these days, But I won't lie; hey I beat 'em with the flow for days, 'Cause I love it, a pen and pads like a red rag to a bull, I see red like Leningrad, Raising a crowd from a vacant lot's like, like how? Raising a brow on the face of god right? Right now,
<h> Pressure Verse 4
<p> And I love it a life with no regret, No success without a price that owes a debt, I roll the dice and despite the road ahead, Hope that in a crisis I might just know the ledge, But I love it like take away beer, And a sunset to lay away our day-to-day fears, See haters under rates us but this status takes years, And it ain't where we're at; it's how we made our way here
<h> Sia Chorus
<p> B-Boys, I met you at the bus stop, We had nothing but the tuck shop, We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops, Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop I love it, I love it
<h> Suffa Verse 5
<p> And we can be in a hotel, worst part of town and, Support act, we ain't half as loud but, Twice as nice you can ask the crowd then, We passing out in a departure lounge and, I love it; I hug the road like an old friend, Like the world won't revolve unless we're rolling on it, It holds them on it, it's soul melodic, And oh they want it and I love it,
<h> Pressure Verse 6
<p> Been chasing the dream Everyday a new place, new faces and scene, Living out a suitcase few breaks in between, There's been very few days I'd loose faith in my team, Got love far from home through the winter and summer, No matter how hard the road or the distance I cover, Even bitter when I'm missing my significant other, I wouldn't trade it for the world given another, 'Cause I love it...
<h> Sia Chorus
<p> B-Boys... B-Boys, I met you at the bus stop, I love it, I love it, We had nothing but the tuck shop, I love it, I love it, We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops, I love it, I love it, Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop I love it, I love it
<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> This whole world's in a rush to be living plush, but never rich enough, Till that mirrors such a stranger we're asking is it us? Losing your vision, make one stupid decision, You've become the newest victim of the human condition It's a crying shame; honestly it's a survival game, While we die in vein making somebody rich, Like we scared of taking that step, Every days just another that escaped us if we don't make an affect, Back seat revolutionaries ain't lions at heart, Even the slightest of sparks can light up the dark, And everybody wants a piece of the action, Like peace and relaxing became a niche for the deceased or the lacking, Success, pleasures of the flesh and beheld, Treasures and endless excess in which we measure ourselves, I've faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans, Hope they understand how grateful I am
<h> Chorus
<p> We do it right here, right now, With my peers, my house, And fight here till the day we're gone and rest in white clouds, Life here, life out, If I'm a die here with my doubts, Then as night nears we're gonna do it till they turn the lights out
<h> Pressure Verse 2
<p> And it starts with us, seeking an everlasting rush, Pharmaceutical market drugs, liquor and grass and dust, Murder, lust, self-worth, hurt and trust, Burden us like a curse till we return to dust, Keeping us on like we're marching to the beat of a gong, Freedom is from our own hearts and those we leave the upon, Lingering on through the words that we sing in our songs, Even a strong foundation we could blink and it's gone, So we carve out our marks and master our own path, In a castle of glass our heart where our homes are, Wars in our vein, that's why we walk in the rain, Of course if the name burns brighter it was forged in the flame, You'll never get a break until your dead or make fifty, And a pension ain't a pay you resonate with me? I've faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans, I hope they understand how grateful I am
<h> Chorus
<p> We do it right here, right now, With my peers, my house, And fight here till the day we're gone and rest in white clouds, Life here, life out, If I'm a die here with my doubts, Then as night nears we're gonna do it till they turn the lights out We won't go, no we won't go, we won't go, no we won't go, We won't go, no we won't go, we won't go, no we won't go, We won't go, no we won't go, we won't go, no we won't go, We won't go, no we won't go, we won't go, no we won't go
<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> When I came, I started like an arsonist to set a flame, Mastering this art, I'm everlasting when I pen my name, Darker like my letters stained markers on the head of Cain, Sharper than a marksmen with a target in my centre frame, A father, so my red I vein's harboured by my said in name, Or rather with my other forefathers and genetic strain, If we ain't asking for respect or fame, With words as dope as marijuana, though it's hard to take what's said in vein, A splinter faction so we're carving up against the grain, Laughing at them grasping over stardom and a sense of claim, Hard to hang your head in shame rather than accept the blame, Own your hardships, we're only master when we shed the chains, Affect the game, 'cause and effect, check the change, Forget your name, and not the part of it from where you came, Dangerous tracks like a scar where you inject the vein, Murdering your martyrs, I'm the harbinger to end the pain
<h> Lotek Chorus
<p> Unforgiven staying hidden like we're living in bunkers, Whether you're in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto, Dominican or Indian we're living like hunters, Whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda, What we doing Tek? Staying hidden like we're living in bunkers, Whether you're in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto, Dominican or Indian we're living like hunters, Whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda
<h> Suffa Verse 2
<p> I've got a cache of beats to make 'em get on the floor, Ranging from better than yours, to way better than yours, The heavy metal supporter leaving competitors floored, The most malevolent devil to ever tread on the shore, I'm a composer with a grudge ready to settle the score, And you supposedly the one to wreck like never before? Please, you a stooge like you're standing with Iggy, So please, bear with me like I'm standing with grizzlies, I'm a dark moon rising, bred in the 'burbs, I'm far beyond the horizon, ahead of the curve, And now your head is on swerve like you're Linda Blair and, Painted eyes on my eyelids so they think I'm staring, Even when I'm sleeping, eye the angles, I sleep with demons, dine with angels, Screaming 'I'm the last one that you wanna start on, I'm sicker than lighting the next one off the last one
<h> Lotek Chorus
<p> Unforgiven staying hidden like we're living in bunkers, Whether you're in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto, Dominican or Indian we're living like hunters, Whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda, What we doing Tek? Staying hidden like we're living in bunkers, If you living in Tonga, or you living in Russia, Sydney city to Nigeria they're living like hunters, Whether you're in the Gaza or live in Casablanca
<h> Black Thought Verse 3
<p> Kick it up a little notch let the heat knock For the number one soul brother next to Pete Rock I'm from the gutter, came out my mother Tariq Trot Doctor told me I was only human like the beatbox I been sicker than dope fiends in detox And been around plenty time like a G-Shock I ain't doing the kind of my dimes my brother Keith got It's Mr. Big Stuff taking Heavy D's spot, The same Rik Geezy, my man speak easy Old soul, so ice cold, they can't unfreeze me... listen Streets need me so, I represent my town Two one pound, where they keep enough shots to go around Watch the crown, most underrated, none above it You gotta love it, folks wanna hate it, In a P.A.N.A. mera Porsche four door Heading downtown riding 'round town, bumping Wurx shit
<h> Lotek Chorus
<p> Unforgiven staying hidden like we're living in bunkers, Whether you're in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto, Dominican or Indian we're living like hunters, Whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda, What we doing Tek? Staying hidden like we're living in bunkers, If you living in Tonga, or you living in Russia, Sydney city to Nigeria they're living like hunters, Whether you're in the Gaza or live in Casablanca We're staying hidden like we're living in bunkers, If you living in Tonga, or you living in Russia, Sydney city to Nigeria they're living like hunters, Whether you're in the Gaza or live in Casablanca
<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> Another war another martyr revered, Passed the fear from their fathers then it's lasting for years, Bullets don't discriminate the skin colour they pierce, We speak the same language brother; love, laughter and tears, Refugees trading death for a prison, While some base a set of opinions on race, sex or religion, C'mon, enough day to day stress of just living, Without giving a fuck if they're hated just cause you're different, Let's do it under the name of the love that became lost, Dress it up how you want, we're cut from the same cloth, Scars of hate, frowns stitched to our faces, Can't escape the cage we forge, we've got bars to break, For those living every bit of the struggle, Given to hustle trying to figure how they fit in the puzzle, Cause right now we're in pieces and peace is the people as one, Till then we're treated like we're speaking in tongues so here we come
<h> Chorus
<p> I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum, I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
<h> Chali 2na Verse 2
<p> Media is teaching the young, debate about belief in the one, Can make an eight-year soldier fall asleep with a gun, While tax mans hands deep in your funds, raping your ones, Money tight like we tweaking the drums it's like we speaking in tongues, But no book burnings or church sermons, I surf currents, my words burn like a dirt furnace, Confusion leads and anguish sells, But this music succeeds where even language fails, To convey free honest expression, It's a problem trying to get people to acknowledge progression, My goal is to leave a lasting iconic impression, Controlling crowds like demonic possession and ain't no time to invest in, Biting the hand that created the platform, Attaching pseudo patriotic crap to a rap song, Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one, And yet we're treated like we're speaking in tongues so here we come,
<h> Chorus
<p> I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum, I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
<h> Suffa Verse 3
<p> I would never, Hate someone for the way they display love for someone else, (And if you do) The blame comes from the weight of the way that you see yourself, Take some of the weight off your plate by taking the hate away, And then maybe you'll make your way to start loving yourself Fear's a cancer logic is a countermeasure, A property that you can't count or measure, I got a problem with people who got a problem with, The way that other people wanna live -- that's their prerogative, They're mad at how you love, where your prayers are going, Their anger's like a drug, they're mad at where you from, But fuck a redneck checking if your visa's valid, They act like pigs and chickens I'm sick of Ceaser salad, So we seize the mallet, and we swing on the ignorant, Can't speak our language? Then we'll see if you can sing in it, Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one, And yet we're treated like we're speaking in tongues so here we come
<h> Chorus
<p> I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum, I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
<h> Bridge
<p> They pick me up just to pull me down, March to different drums, come from all around, It's like we're speaking in tongues, It's like we're speaking in tongues, They pick me up just to pull me down, March to different drums, come from all around, It's like we're speaking in tongues, It's like we're speaking in tongues
<h> Chorus
<p> I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum, I am, you are, we are one, We're two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun, We be the left hand, right hand, right man? But sometimes it seems like we're speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> Now you're gone life moves on without you, You always wanted me to write a song about you, Where to begin? I caught her in fling, They've been asking where you've been so I thought I'd fill them in, See there's nothing that I wouldn't put past you, When she got a lot of men that's the harsh truth, You find the truth hard to swallow, gotta ask you? Kind regards I've been doing well these past few, She's a master with plans and a terrible feud, Leaving scars on a man if she's ever pursued, Even after you're damned and aware of the wound, Your beating hearts in her hand like the 'Temple of Doom', She's a beast in disguise of a sweet song siren, That feasts on admirers so keep on driving, Unleashed like the virus Calici we're blinded, And weak so she think she can keep on lying? Enough is enough its just counter productive, When trust is inductive to being so fucked with, And love is a high you can buy in a substance, Know what? Fuck this it was always destructive, I'm a let you know I've yet you go, You'll never affect my mode get dressed and go, You better test the road so step and know, Your left alone to be another stepping stone it goes
<h> Suffa Verse 2
<p> She slept on the couch for about four days or so, Then left like a southpaw, bout four days ago, I'm blessed with a mouth than can outtalk ASIO, But from this fallout my poor mouth couldn't save me so, Now I spend my days alone, playing me some Maseo, Telephone messages; I doubt she ever plays 'em though, CD in the stereo, TV on the radio, I was a lover, but the love it couldn't save me though, Baby don't play me, don't break me yo save me, Don't make me go crazy like saying don't taze me bro, Maybe you're right, and it's all for the best, And maybe you're right, but I'm all you'll have left, When the best friends head for the S bend, Less than zero, you'll need me like a western hero, You used to use my chest as a pillow, paro, Now my heart is just a target for an arrow
<h> Suffa Verse 3
<p> Every breath you take is filling the,?Lungs that hug the heart that's killing me, Feelings Suffa foster for her, Lost her, not my lover, Billy Jean, So pretty please, to a girl so pretty, please, You really need to not make me crawl like a millipede, Feeling the fool? Maybe you're not fulfilling me, But silly me, I'm feeling this Philly's all I really need like
<h> GOOD FOR NOTHING
<h> Chorus
<p> I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing
<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> Problematic child from a god abandoned isle, Where Hip Hop is like a convict on a standing trial, Dropping havoc I'll rock the planet wild, Till they shoot me in a movie Hong Kong combatant style, Plastic rapping and disposable culture, Poet or solider, falter and get thrown to the vultures, We wear our scars like a badge of honour sewn in the shoulder, Cross the unknown, rock alone like the coast of Gibraltar, Looking over my shoulder, radio and payola, Keep us alien on air like being flown by Travolta, Flow with a vocal assault of the microphone and controller, Harder to handle than a loaded revolver coated with sulphur, You in a house made of glass throwing a boulder, But never see the light of day car like car motors on solar, Going for broke don't mean you're going broke for the culture, We'd hang ourselves given rope and pergola
<h> Chorus
<p> I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like, I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like,
<h> Suffa Verse 2
<p> Beast of burden, carry the weight, I got divorced from reality to marry the break, In a bally and cape, I get carried away, Like a cadaver on a battlefield, make barriers break, Man my chariot waits; I can't stay for the gala, Music is dead, fames alive Lady Gaga, They complain about the drama go, Play the martyr role better than Mohammed Atta, Suffa, grimy as Calcutta, Beat you single-handed like Def Leppard's drummer, I'm about to blow like meth on the cooker, Leaving me with mic's like leaving pets with the butcher, Don't put a foot wrong, think for a good long minute, Shut your mouth, put a foot-long in it, You're dealing with one of the best to bust so, Tyler Durden, don't beat yourself up bro
<h> Chorus
<p> I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like, I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like,
<h> Chorus
<p> We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa, They claiming they want to, they really don't want to, You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers, Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you, We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa, They claiming they want to, they really don't want to, You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers, Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you
<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> When I start breathing heavily, I scar the beat the beat and melody, They said that we dreaming we'll keep reaching till leaving heavenly, The key to freedoms said to be, release and leave the memory, Think you offended me? Please, with critics like these who needs an enemy? Indeed a breed of pedigree beast unleashing speech telepathy, Here to bleed the industry of its diseased and evil effigy, Demons, thieving, greed and revelry, we're in need and seeking remedy, But it seems to stay ten feet ahead of me like a centipede, I'm a train upon a track; I'm a flame upon a match, Ain't straying from my place I want my face upon the map, I'm the weight upon your back, I'm a razor your lap, We came to conquer, stage and opera, fade it onto black, Now hush, hear the voice, so addicted to the, Rush to fill the void, missing everything we, Love to feel joy, build it up then we, Crush, kill, destroy
<h> Chorus
<p> We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa, They claiming they want to, they really don't want to, You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers, Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you, We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa, They claiming they want to, they really don't want to, You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers, Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you
<h> Suffa Verse 2
<p> I go bananas every time, mind blown Nirvana, Nevermind, They need some ketamine to calm us, harness the darkness every line, Till I been enlightened I'm leaving 'em terrified, Like Bin Laden been hiding under their bed every night they go beddy-bye, Fat as the fattest Federline, fat as that cat post Brittney, Madness that is a friend of mine, rappers get mashed so quickly, War comes, hear the roar from the raw drums, beat your poor son just from the boredom, Jump up, but you're stunned, dumb struck, you're done like Young Buck post Fifty, We claw at the morons, and pour on the soothing hooks on heaters, Like them pouring the Boron on core on the shore of Fukushima, They adore the recordings and we lording it over them, Think we're joking? Then we're going door to door with some Dobermans, No DMX, they thinking they got me pegged like BMX, But ain't seeing T or X, Briggs, Hons, Debris or Vents, We the best, no Khaled, We the best like Ali, Muhammad
<h> Chorus x 2
<p> We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa, They claiming they want to, they really don't want to, You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers, Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you, We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa, They claiming they want to, they really don't want to, You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers, Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

<h> Verse 1 -- Suffa
<p> We went from spitting jams to fifty fans in a little cramped room, A shoebox you couldn't fit a shoe in to touring, Switzerland with my man in a mini-van, Being the man of the minute can happen in a minute man, And it's funny, I've seen buddies that I trust turn away, 'Cause money can't buy you love but It can earn you hate, And none of you gave a fuck till the movement went large, Now every crew is making music, every dude has got bars, Now every half-ass bar fly up in the bar rhymes, We sit about, spitting 'bout the dark and the hard times, But got perspective on the fighting for the crowns and the such, When we encountered and old pal who had been down on his luck, In some Volleys pushing trolleys eating soup from a tin, My girls like golly, man these pollie's aren't improving a thing, Well swap your worries for some Bolly, swap your suit for some wings, And fly with us, we light it up and it's a beautiful thing
<h> Classified Verse 2
<p> That's where I started at, the days of Walkmans and Starter hats, The open mic nights mastering the art of rap, We man-made, underground like an artefact, We don't need to worry when the market crash, I'm from the bottom, bottom of New Scotland, Planted all my seeds watered them then watched it blossom, Then they try to tell me over time we'd be forgotten, rotten, Thinking that you'regonna keep me boxed in? Nonsense, Hilltop and Class rock till your noggin's nodding, You can walk in my shoes but never fit in my jeans, I do this with no option till my body's old and rotten and exhausted, Keep it going cause I'm living my dream, Till the grave we'll spit the pain and, when it comes to picture painting, We might be the illest rated with the visuals illustrated, That's ill communication, therapy for life without the rehabilitation, Keep waiting I'm about to blow up
<h> Pressure Verse 3
<p> We about to blow it up, but we all started this as amateur, Carving out a path was a hardship for the traveller, It said that raps a facade, you'll never manage it, In these parts, I guess it's our scars that give us character, We misfits and slackers, at risks kids or hackers, With a wish list, sick of doing six shifts at Macca's, From listeners to rappers, prestigious to hapless, I don't need a gift to know that this shit is backwards, When we're done officially another visionary, Will lights the flame, write their name in their sweat, blood and infamy, It's gutter symphony fuck the industry, Let them come we're the ones carving history, So we rhyme for the hurting, poor hard working for, International heard applaud to local suburban tour, Y'all gave a purpose for the roar when the curtains draw, Furthermore ask yourself what you're searching for?
<h> Solo Verse 4
<p> Follow me to a place I like to go, Liner notes are signposts to find that which lies below, Born in eighty eight so I came in late, To find for the first time in life I felt right at home, Through the growing pains and hostile takeovers, People trying to put us down like Beethoven, We stayed strong and remained focused, Until they had no other choice but to stand up and take notice, Never thought what I wrote on a page back in the day, Would ever have me catching a plane, Or rapping up on a stage, Staring out at the crowd in amazement, Thinking back on the days when, We were confined to the limitations of the basement, The subterranean kids became the main event, I pay respect to those who spent days laying foundations, Countdown to detonation
<h> SHREDDING THE BALLOON
<h> Suffa Verse 1
<p> Like we always do about this time, ink lines for the sick rhyme inclined, It's grimy shit but naught that can't be fixed with a little bit of spitshine, Big time like Frankie in Vegas, inspiring like Ali and Frazier, Spit it out till we spilling out on to the street start a party up with our neighbours, I'd rather be part of your playlist, than ever be part of the A-list, Harness the energy, heart of a pedigree with the scars of a sadist, I go so hard on the pavement; I go so far with my statements, That I don't know where they end and where I start it's all part of game it's, The farthest I've came since I started to play it, I spar with these artists, the heartless and brainless, We're harnessed by chains that are hard to escape and you change then they label us bastards or traitors, They're charlatans, they're haters, they start on us but they're fake as, Our parliament, but don't be disheartened by them pardon their failures, If we don't forgive our enemies, we'll crawl the walls like centipedes, Burn our energy like fossil fuels and fuel our own damn effigy, And we'll all burn like Hennessey, so keep on then and step with me, John Lennon let it be, dead the beef like abattoirs, before these scavengers tear at me
<h> Chorus
<p> I've been waiting to come back, Like where the hell is the show? Like a balloon on a thumbtack, Getting ready to blow, I've been waiting to come back, Like where the hell is the show? Like a balloon on a thumbtack, Getting ready to blow
<h> Suffa Verse 2
<p> And it might blow up but it won't go pop, And it might blow up but it won't burst, She said she might grow old but she won't grow up, Well she might, but only if I go first, She wears her heart on her sleeve like; she's wearing a patch on her shoulder, It's not a matter of whether I can catch her, more a matter of whether I can hold her, She thinks out loud she's got me; she laughs with her whole body, I think about how she got it all figured out and wonder why she'd even want me? Each night I find it's the same ole, when I crawl inside in the evening, I lie down next to an angel; fall asleep and fly with my demons, They say don't live in the past and live each day like it was your last but, I'd rather live each moment like it was my first, take it slow and sip from the glass, Savour the moment, spit vicious bars then pray for opponents, Sounds so serious don't it? But I'm not concerned with a thing, This is book three, Tolkien, Return of the King, The kings have arrived; we drink from the sky, We fall from all 'cause we think we can fly, But our wings have been tied, and the winging and lies, Have me I'm wishing that I could bridge the divide, You living the life? In the blink of an eye The shine of the bling and the rims that you ride, Can all disappear so live for the rhyme, Not material things your gift can provide
<h> Chorus
<p> I've been waiting to come back, Like where the hell is the show? Like a balloon on a thumbtack, We're getting ready to blow, I've been waiting to come back, Like where the hell is the show? Like a balloon on a thumbtack, I'm getting ready right now I'm getting ready
<h> Suffa Verse 3
<p> Since 'State of the Art' we've stayed in the yard just waiting to start this shit all over, Laying in bars for a day and a half, had to switch from gin to soda, And by like mid October, record was six months over, Due, and I'm like dude what you expect? I'm only three months sober, Coming up turning tree trunks over, running up burning divas, posers, Run amok till the sun is up or till one of us # live la vidaloca, I'm going ta roll until I fold, like I got a hold of Propafol, So beautiful to know you all but for now peace I'm over and out
<h> Suffa
<p> We were gone so long, Spreading our wings they'd thought we'd broken up, Thought I only closed my eyes for a second, next thing I've woken up, They said we thought we'd let you sleep in, you looked at peace and, I was like you should have spoken up, All this time trying to sober up, Swore a crowd not a crown would be the next thing I opened up, Saw I was so corrupt, I wasn't coping but, Seeing friends going down, had me choking up, Plus a drunk nearly killed Debris in a car that crashed, Left us a DJ who had to start from scratch, So I arched my back, stretched my shoulders, Said let's shed this wretched coldness, Drink from the sun and swallow the heat, Just to spit it out, and have 'em follow the beat, What we gotta give this crowd's something of another class, March till the sun is down and we're walking under stars
<h> GOOD FOR NOTHING -- K21 REMIX
<h> Chorus
<p> I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing
<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> Problematic child from a god abandoned isle, Where Hip Hop is like a convict on a standing trial, Dropping havoc I'll rock the planet wild, Till they shoot me in a movie Hong Kong combatant style, Plastic rapping and disposable culture, Poet or solider, falter and get thrown to the vultures, We wear our scars like a badge of honour sewn in the shoulder, Cross the unknown, rock alone like the coast of Gibraltar, Looking over my shoulder, radio and payola, Keep us alien on air like being flown by Travolta, Flow with a vocal assault of the microphone and controller, Harder to handle than a loaded revolver coated with sulphur, You in a house made of glass throwing a boulder, But never see the light of day car like car motors on solar, Going for broke don't mean you're going broke for the culture, We'd hang ourselves given rope and pergola
<h> Chorus
<p> I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like, I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like,
<h> Suffa Verse 2
<p> Beast of burden, carry the weight, I got divorced from reality to marry the break, In a bally and cape, I get carried away, Like a cadaver on a battlefield, make barriers break, Man my chariot waits; I can't stay for the gala, Music is dead, fames alive Lady Gaga, They complain about the drama go, Play the martyr role better than Mohammed Atta, Suffa, grimy as Calcutta, Beat you single-handed like Def Leppard's drummer, I'm about to blow like meth on the cooker, Leaving me with mic's like leaving pets with the butcher, Don't put a foot wrong, think for a good long minute, Shut your mouth, put a foot-long in it, You're dealing with one of the best to bust so, Tyler Durden, don't beat yourself up bro
<h> Chorus
<p> I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like, I'm no good; yes I'm no good, Let me tell you no good, girl I'm no good, I'm no good for nothing, And I might be no good but when I seize the mic, I can spit it like, like, I'm no good, Yes I'm no good, I'm no good, Yes I'm no good, I'm no good
<h> NOW YOU'RE GONE -- SUFFA REMIX
<h> Pressure Verse 1
<p> Now you're gone life moves on without you, You always wanted me to write a song about you, Where to begin? I caught her in fling, They've been asking where you've been so I thought I'd fill them in, See there's nothing that I wouldn't put past you, When she got a lot of men that's the harsh truth, You find the truth hard to swallow, gotta ask you? Kind regards I've been doing well these past few, She's a master with plans and a terrible feud, Leaving scars on a man if she's ever pursued, Even after you're damned and aware of the wound, Your beating hearts in her hand like the 'Temple of Doom', She's a beast in disguise of a sweet song siren, That feasts on admirers so keep on driving, Unleashed like the virus Calici we're blinded, And weak so she think she can keep on lying? Enough is enough its just counter productive, When trust is inductive to being so fucked with, And love is a high you can buy in a substance, Know what? Fuck this it was always destructive, I'm a let you know I've yet you go, You'll never affect my mode get dressed and go, You better test the road so step and know, Your left alone to be another stepping stone it goes
<h> Suffa Verse 2
<p> She slept on the couch for about four days or so, Then left like a southpaw, bout four days ago, I'm blessed with a mouth than can outtalk ASIO, But from this fallout my poor mouth couldn't save me so, Now I spend my days alone, playing me some Maseo, Telephone messages; I doubt she ever plays 'em though, CD in the stereo, TV on the radio, I was a lover, but the love it couldn't save me though, Baby don't play me, don't break me yo save me, Don't make me go crazy like saying don't taze me bro, Maybe you're right, and it's all for the best, And maybe you're right, but I'm all you'll have left, When the best friends head for the S bend, Less than zero, you'll need me like a western hero, You used to use my chest as a pillow, paro, Now my heart is just a target for an arrow
<h> Suffa Verse 3
<p> Every breath you take is filling the,?Lungs that hug the heart that's killing me, Feelings Suffa foster for her, Lost her, not my lover, Billy Jean, So pretty please, to a girl so pretty, please, You really need to not make me crawl like a millipede, Feeling the fool? Maybe you're not fulfilling me, But silly me, I'm feeling this Philly's all I really need like
