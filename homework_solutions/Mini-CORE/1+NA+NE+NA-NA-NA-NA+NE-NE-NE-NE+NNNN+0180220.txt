<p> 'About 20,000 are followed by a coma of three weeks or longer. Some of them die, others regain health.
<p> 'But an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 people a year remain trapped in an intermediate stage - they go on living without ever coming back again.'
<p> Supporters of euthanasia and assisted suicide argue that people who have lain in persistent vegetative states for years should be given the opportunity to have crucial medical support withdrawn because of the 'indignity' of their condition.
<p> But there have been several cases in which people judged to be in vegetative states or deep comas have recovered.
<p> Twenty years ago, Carrie Coons, an 86-year-old from New York, regained consciousness after a year, took small amounts of food by mouth and engaged in conversation.
<p> Only days before her recovery, a judge had granted her family's request for the removal of the feeding tube which had been keeping her alive.
<p> In the UK in 1993, doctors switched off the life support system keeping alive Tony Bland, a 22-year- old who had been in a coma for three years following the Hillsborough disaster.
<p> Dr Laureys was not available for comment yesterday and it is not clear why he thought Mr Houben should have the hi-tech screening when so many years had passed.

<p> Other news sources provide more details than this article. Apparently, he was able to communicate simple "yes/no" answers by moving his foot. The use of "Facilitated Communication" does cloud the debate somewhat, though. There is no valid comparison to the Terry Schiavo case; she was in a true, persistent vegetative state and her brain had significantly atrophied. I suspect that the most cretinous comments are from those who were directed to this story by the Drudge Report or World Net Daily. Somebody has been selling computers and Internet access to the left half of the bell curve here in the US. I believe it started with AOL. Unfortunately, we allow them to vote, too.
<p> I've been there, done that. How dare you dismiss normal brain waves when these people could be screaming inside with boredom in their own personal hell unless allowed computer access to read. There are methods to use the eyes to work a computer and several methods now out there although some of them are expensive. I at least can move. Now I have recovered and am walking after being denied care from Nursing Home Without Walls in Hawaii and left to die just BECAUSE I walked once. It would have taken walking every day with ever lessening care to live but since I had been healed to live by God in order to write down music heard on the other side in a miracle album, I guess God figured he could fix it so I could walk in order to survive the loss of care. If you are interested in a miracle album, free lyrics, the free miracle story or free samples of the music, contact me at spacepoet@gmail.com
<p> I agree that the facilitated communication part looked REALLY questionable on the news footage. I would like to see whether it can be replicated with a different person helping him. As I read elsewhere, it is similar to a Ouija board. Sometimes the helper isn't even aware that he/she is creating the sentences.
<p> I am glad people are pointing out that this is hoax. The real question is how can media be so easily duped? All you have to do is watch a video and you can see the helper is really the one doing the typing. How can we force the media produces to think a little before they publish or broadcast nonsense? In the States this is going to be used against health care reform.
<p> I have seen a whole room full of profoundly Austistic people apparently using facilitated communication to spout advanced poetry. These people were not even looking at the keyboards they were 'using'. Carers were directing the hand (whether knowingly or not) to type out complicated messages to the outside world. This is sick and a terrible abuse of the persons human rights. How dare they put words in someone's mouth. In some cases it may be a totally appropriate tool ( I know people with cerebral palsy who have physical disabilities only and benefit greatly from similar ideas - but with much less facilitation! - if the hand needs total guiding we should be very suspicious of who the message is coming from.
<p> This IS a hoax. Please stop. It's called "facilitated communication" and was debunked YEARS ago. Many other have beaten me to it but I am repeating to make sure these terrible false hope stories of him communicating keep spreading through the media. It's not true. There IS brain activity similar to a fully conscious person but there ISN'T communication via a keyboard.
<p> I doubt this can be accurate. Forced mental inactivity for this length of time would have serious consequences on a totally healthy brain/mind. Coherent and just a bit ticked by the experience doesn't ring true. I'll check it out and comment on chrisnorthern.blogspot.com
<p> This is a sham. 1. As mentioned before, the facilitated communication method is fake. It brings in another person's bias and works essentially the same as a ouija board. 2. The "hi-tech scans" don't mean anything. Just because you could make some brain cells fire doesn't mean that the person is aware of it. People get fooled pretty easily, especially with emotionally-charged things like this. I'm disappointed that the doctors would promote this sham.
