<h> NEVER SHOUT NEVER - OVER THE YEARS lyrics
<p> I'm sorry for the nights I let you down Now all that's left to say is that I turned around Back to the boy you fell in love with Not this plague that brings you down Remind your mom to call me I still care Cause her approval meant the world And I will not dare to disagree With the life you arranged Just remember only God knows if I've changed I'll sing along to every song I'll tag along for the ride Cause in my head, I'm right there too, Through the good times The bad ones too I'm here for you Cause in my dreams You're the one who keeps me asleep On the nights where I could care less If I ever woke up again
