<h> Pretend That This Is Fiction Lyrics
<h> Pink Spiders
<p> Oh brother, now we're going undercover 'Cause she's more than just a lover to me Can't you see that there's a reason for this heresy and treason? It's the season for instability Good lovin', two and one more in the oven This is way above a discovery Supersede your jurisdiction, let's pretend that this is fiction Make a story out of all that we see So can we agree enough is enough? Madeline sees the magazines for the trees so she tells me that Everything needs some time in the sun Everyone breathes their oxygen quietly, carefully carrying along Hey neighbor, can I ask you for a favor? See I'm sketching up the neighborhood's dreams 'Cause I need to hit the walls of coffee bars and shopping malls And show the world a side that they've never seen So what do you think about teaming up? Gravity sleeps when we see that all we are is not all we will be 'Cause everything needs some time in the sun Everyone breathes their oxygen quietly, carefully carrying along So can we agree enough is enough? Madeline sees the magazines for the trees so she tells me that Everything needs some time in the sun Everyone breathes their oxygen quietly, carefully carrying along Can we agree enough is enough? Madeline sees the magazines for the trees So she tells me that everything needs some time in the sun Everyone breathes their oxygen quietly, carefully carrying along So can we agree enough is enough? Can we agree enough is enough? Can we agree enough is enough? Can we agree enough is enough?
