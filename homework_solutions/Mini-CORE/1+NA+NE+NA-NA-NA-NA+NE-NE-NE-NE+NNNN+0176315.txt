<h> Fox News Bureau Chief: I Thought It Was 'Far-Fetched' When I Speculated Obama Is A Socialist
<p> In 2009, current Fox News DC Bureau Chief Bill Sammon admitted that he didn't really believe charges that Obama was a "socialist" when he encouraged Fox News staff to use the term. But, he claims, he soon realized it was true.
<p> In February, Media Matters obtained a 2008 e-mail by Sammon, encouraging Fox News employees to push the idea that Obama is a socialist ahead of the election.
<p> But in new audio obtained by Media Matters , Sammon tells an audience on a high-priced Mediterranean cruise sponsored by the conservative Hillsdale College that he didn't think it was true:
<p> Last year, candidate Barack Obama stood on a sidewalk in Toledo, Ohio, and first let it slip to Joe the Plumber that he wanted to quote, 'spread the wealth around. At that time, I have to admit, that I went on TV on Fox News and publicly engaged in what I guess was some rather mischievous speculation about whether Barack Obama really advocated socialism, a premise that privately I found rather far-fetched.
<p> Sammon's argument was that he realized after the 2009 auto industry bailout that the idea was not so crazy after all: "All of a sudden, the debate over whether America was heading for socialism seemed anything but far-fetched."
<p> "The debate over whether America is headed for socialism seems all too real," he said, "especially to those who still believe in capitalism."
<p> Here's the audio:
<p> In an interview today with Howard Kurtz of The Daily Beast , Sammon said that in 2008 "I considered it kind of a remarkable notion that we would even be having the conversation" about whether Obama is a socialist, but describing it as "mischievous speculation" was "my probably inartful way of saying, 'Can you believe how far this thing has come?'"
<p> Kurtz writes that Sammon also said "he doesn't regret repeatedly raising it on the air because, Sammon says, 'it was a main point of discussion on all the channels, in all the media' -- and by 2009 he was 'astonished by how the needle had moved.'"
<p> Sammon has also been caught telling staff to question the existence of climate change.
