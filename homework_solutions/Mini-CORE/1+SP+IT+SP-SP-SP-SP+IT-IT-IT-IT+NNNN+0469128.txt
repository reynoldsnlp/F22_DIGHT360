<h> Enthusiastic Mongrels Go AMUC
<p> Our hunt for Captains of teams heading for the 2012 Australian Mixed Ultimate Championships has proved very fruitful these last few weeks.  Now we bring down one of the most dangerous beasts of all ? Kelli Brown of Hybrid Vigour.
<p> afda.com: Let?s get straight to the point Kelli, because time is short.  Force Sideline have described you as ?pretty stacked?.  How did this come together?
<p> Kelli: We formed in large part in one night down at League.  Basically Juan and I who were on Pal last year inveigled some young blood from Melb Uni and then invited a couple of riff raff from the Goldie and then mighty Min from WA.
<p> afda.com: So it?s the League itself in Melbourne that?s stacked?
<p> Kelli: Stack is what Tom Rogacki does?. We were not that planned?we just said yes welcome to anyone pretty much that night at league that was interested in playing. Were not stacked were a fun diverse bunch ?a mix of experience and youthful vigour.
<p> afda.com: Aside from the scoring lots of points thing, how will people recognise you at AMUC this year?
<p> Kelli: We will be wearing cool black and silver 2XU shirts - free due to generous sponsorship by Andrews Burgers - best in Victoria.  Actualy a bunch of hybrids just ate some free burgers just recently after being filmed playing Frisbee on for Channel Ten News.
<p> afda.com: Fame! And aha ? conveniently located near Albert Park we understand.  It feels like we should insert a hyperlink there.  Perhaps we at afda.com shall have to visit during the Hat this year.  And the team name?
<p> Kelli: Hybrid vigour, or outbreeding enhancement, is defined as the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring.  The physiological vigour of an organism as manifested in its rapidity of growth, strength, its height and general robustness.......hyperlink for Andrews is andrewshamburgers.com.au
<p> afda.com: So it?s a science thing
<p> Kelli: Well, Pal won Mixed Nats last year.  So a few of us were on Pal Pedigrees but Hybrids (basically mongrels) are simply stronger than purebreds.  Hence the name.  Suits us we are a diverse scruffy bunch.
<p> afda.com: And being scruffy, I?m guessing the preparation has been shambolic?
<p> Kelli: Well, we played a punching bags game to 3 and we won.....Woooo Hoooo!
<p> afda. com:  So tell us more about the team.
<p> Kelli: Cron ... he should be pretty entertaining.  Patso is always good for a laugh too.  Very suggestible ... so no yelling huck it to him or hammer it from the sideline please.
<p> Annie and Chris Choo Choo are super sneaky goal takers.  And its beauty in motion watching the snail glide across the field.  Marcenator is funny too ... never likes to catch with two hands. But seriously Declan is a former soccer goalie ... watch him spring sideways in D ... he thinks he's in front of the net!
<p> afda.com: There?s a certain, somewhat party-oriented gentleman, that you?ve yet to mention on the team.
<p> Kelli: Well you don't have to look out for Mr Rappazzo he's too hard to miss.  Our team costume theme is off course Hybrids ...so I am guessing Patz should go as half bear half something else that?s really hairy.  He says he?s simply going topless as a gorilla
<p> afda.com: Half-animals?
<p> Kelli: We've been briefed to turn up as something like an animal and we have to then give half of our outfit to another team member...should be pretty funny.
<p> I?d also recommend looking out for Juan... always looks cute in a costume (always looks cute actually)....should have seen him at Halibut last year in leggings!.  I am planning on making him wear my leopard leggings.
<p> afda.com: We?re drifting into too much information territory there.  Is anyone backing up from AUGs (the lucky buggers)?  Is anyone backing up from Worlds?  How are they doing?
<p> Kelli: We have three of our top players suffering!  We are crossing our fingers!  The question should be anyone still recovering from Halibut Olympics?  Answer Patso, Tao and myself.
<p> afda.com: Your line is looking very solid ? who?s going to be carrying the weight?
<p> Kelli: Mike's pretty experienced.  I'm a spring chook and I am dieting (despite the Andrews burgers with the  lot).  Patso said he'd carry me if needed.
<p> afda.com: Many successful mixed teams have some couples to provide some solidity ? how does Hybrid Vigour stand up?
<p> Kelli: Mich and Mikey - so cute....they area always all over each other.  nauseating.  I reckon a few of the others on our team should hook up together ... there's a few that'd look really good together.  History tells me that I will seriously have to protect the good looking young talent on our team from some of the northern riff raff (Bienz and Rappazzo!) Georgia, Mich, Annie, Marce - may all be currently single????... be warned.  With so many good looking eligible players on our team I?ll be spending my time dragging them and others away from them.  I'm used to playing with teams of couples so this will be interesting.  I can live vicariously.
<p> afda.com: So which half of your team do you feel are stronger relative to your opponents - your women or your men?
<p> Kelli: Hmmm can?t say.  Pretty even.  We have great chicks, we have great guys.  I am expecting some good connections .... Mich Phillips - Lochy Wise connection...Juan and Chris ChooCHoo and I know each other inside-out.....Lover passes between Rogers and Baker....I hope to make Bienz, Cron, and Declan look good by throwing dodgy long throws and making them layout...hee hee.  Brendan never has to layout....have you seen him run?  I reckon we have the fastest guy in Victoria?hes the dark horse!
<p> afda.com: Speaking of Victoria, how do you think the state will perform this year?
<p> Kelli: We have some great teams, it will be very interesting to see.
<p> What I do know is that we plan to have a lot of fun and in my experience the winners are the grinners and we have some of the best grinners in the state.  Have you seen Cron's grin?  With that grin for inspiration I reckon we do have a pretty good chance of taking out the title.
