<p> Liberal MP Malcolm Turnbull has voiced his support for a conscience vote on gay marriage. Cade Mooney
<p> A CONSCIENCE vote on gay marriage does not look likely in Federal Parliament leaving Opposition frontbencher and civil unions supporter Malcolm Turnbull with no choice but to follow his party line.
<p> Speaking at the Southern Cross University Michael Kirby Lecture Series on the Gold Coast on Friday, Mr Turnbull, who has voiced his support for a conscience vote on the controversial topic, said it did not look likely his leader would change his mind.
<p> "I don't think Mr (Tony) Abbott is likely to change his mind; he has made a decision on that and he has the support of the party room," he said.
<p> Two bills on civil unions recently went through the parliamentary committee process but are not expected to go before Federal Parliament until the end of the year.
<p> Despite the delay, Mr Turnbull is confident federally-recognised civil unions will become a reality.
<p> "While I am very doubtful the numbers are there to legislate for gay marriage in the Federal Parliament I think they are certainly there to legislate for civil unions," he said. "I think it would be a great pity if marriage is not able to be passed in the parliament and that opportunity to pass civil unions should be taken up.
<p> "I think it will be between now and when the parliament is dissolved before the time of the election."
<p> His remarks follow the Queensland Parliament's controversial move to repeal civil union laws and make surrogacy for same-sex couple illegal.
<p> Mr Turnbull would not comment on the moves.
<p> The coalition MP was scheduled to give a speech on gay marriage and human rights at the annual lecture last night but was not giving anything away to reporters beforehand.
<p> He will be joined by former High Court Justice Michael Kirby, who has been a staunch advocate for gay rights throughout his very accomplished legal career.
