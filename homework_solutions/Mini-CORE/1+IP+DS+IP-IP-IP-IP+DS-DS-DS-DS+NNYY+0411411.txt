<p> Originally developed as a savvy basic cable alternative to the WWF's more flashy (and pricy) WrestleMania event, the WCW's Clash of the Champions quickly found its own gonzo identity, pitting its marquee superstars against each other in a series of matches that steadily upped the ante. (When you kick things off with a cage match between Ric Flair and Sting, you're setting a high bar.) This multi-disc collection provides a fantastic look at the greatest hits (and kicks, and jabs, and so forth) of this long-running event. Featuring over 30 matches, this set chronicles the state of the WCW from 1988 to 1997, ranging from the rise of homegrown titans such as Flair and Lex Luger to the later inclusion of WWF icons Hulk Hogan and the late, great Randy "Macho Man" Savage. (Those familiar with Stone Cold Steve Austin as only a chrome-domed good guy might be surprised to see his earlier incarnation as a follically blessed villain.) Improbable athleticism and hijinks of the individual matches aside--how exactly did that referee fail to spot that smuggled-in pair of nunchaku, anyway?--it's fascinating to watch the presentation evolve from relatively lo-fi affairs to full-on theatrical extravaganzas, to the point where the drama outside the ring often exceeds what's going on within the turnbuckles. By the time Sting shows up in the rafters dressed like The Crow with a bird of prey on his arm, the WCW engine has hit full glorious speed. Viewers not up on their grappling history may be confounded by the unexplained squabbles and hero-to-heel transformations that run throughout this compilation (the between-match segments featuring wrestling legend Dusty Rhodes are priceless in many different ways, but comprehensive isn't exactly one of them). Even without prior knowledge, however, the adrenaline rush presented by this set is tough to resist. Party discs don't come much finer. --Andrew Wright
<h> Product Description
<p> For close to a decade, professional wrestling fans loved Clash of the Champions, a series of supercards that aired on TBS, featuring the biggest stars of first NWA and the WCW. Over the course of 35 events from 1988 through 1997, fans were treated to championship contests, grudge matches, and spectacular moments. Many of these matches have never been released on home video until now. The Best of the Clash of the Champions, hosted by 3-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion and WWE Hall of Famer, The American Dream Dusty Rhodes, will highlight some of the greatest matches in the event s ten-year history and features fan favorites Ric Flair, Sting, The Road Warriors, Lex Luger, the Four Horsemen, the nWo, and so many more.
<p> No real complaints except maybe wish there was a documentary and a few different matches but all in all I highly recommend it to any WCW fan. I'm just happy Vince has decided to release this set wish he would do full releases with WCW PPV's like with Wrestlemania,Royal Rumble,Summer Slam etc..but still nice that he isn't forgetting the WCW fans. Also a side note Best Buy has 2 bonus matches:Hollywood Hogan vs. Rick Flair 1996 and The Midnight Express vs. The Fanatics 1988.
<p> Before the era of "WCW Monday Nitro", there was one event available on cable television where you had the matches after match featuring the superstars of the National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling against each other. WWE has "Saturday Night's Main Event" while NWA/WCW had theirs in "The Clash Of The Champions." Dusty Rhodes host this DVD set while it should also be noted that Jesse Ventura's commentary has been removed from the matches he was involved in.
<p> NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Sting - This was the match that made Sting a household name overnight as James J. Dillion was suspended over the ring in the cage to prevent interference in what has gone down as a classic encounter that has stood the test of time today. They went to a time limit draw & had a split decision with judges (which defeats the purpose of the judges in the first place but whatever). When Flair said on the Horsemen DVD that "we made a career making guys...", this was the best example possible that fits that statement. Mar. '88 [Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection]
<p> NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Lex Luger & Barry Windham - The team also known as the "Twin Towers" dominated the first half of this match to the point where Luger he got the Torture Rack on Tully in the first minute & Barry had a sleeperhold so tight on Tully that he was able to keep it on when they both rolled out of the ring. The Horsemen later caught up & did what they did best in tag team wrestling by cutting the ring in half & making their quick tags having this match go back & forth between both teams with the crowd hot the entire time. James J. Dillion got involved in the end as this match didn't go long but it was non-stop action from start to finish. Mar. '88 [Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen; Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]
<p> NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - This was a classic "faces vs. heels" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upperhand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the receiving end of a DDT on the floor. This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the "Great American Bash" PPV the next month. June '88 [The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]
<p> Russian Chain Match: Ricky Morton vs. Ivan Koloff - This chain match was held under the rules that you had to touch all four corners to win. Both men used the chain as a weapon throughout the match from choking, using it to give a low blow, and whip each other while also telling the story of Morton being lighter in weight, he had more trouble pulling Koloff. The quality is what you usually expect in this type of match but the biggest story came afterwords due to Paul Jones making it clear that this was "make it or break it" for the weak link in Koloff. Sept. '88
<p> "I Quit" Match: Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - Despite Flair being the World Champion, this was a non-title match has it evolved past the championship into a fight about pride to the point where both men agreed that the loser would shake the winners hand. Flair was very physical here with his chops from the start to the point where Funk was knocked down & outside numerous times. Funk retaliated by brawling using his taped fist & even the microphone & even trying to choke Flair into giving up. Both men fought on the outside with Funk going for a "slip & slide" on the ringside table right into a chair before Flair began to work over & punish Funk's leg. Ric Flair has his more "unique" series of matches in his career against Terry Funk & this match is no exception as Flair wrestled a more aggressive offensive style here while Funk was his usual self in being a hardcore brawl while able to do little things to make some comedic moments. Nov. '89 [Ultimate Ric Flair Collection; Legends Of Wrestling: Roddy Piper & Terry Funk]
<p> Mil Mascaras vs. Cactus Jack Manson - In a nutshell, this was just Cactus being a body for Mascaras to showcase himself with his various submissions & high flying while Cactus at one took a hard hit falling off the apron with his head smacking the concrete floor. Feb. '90
<p> NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express vs. Rock N' Roll Express - One of the greatest rivalries in tag team history continued here with the R&R Express being able to keep staying one step ahead causing the Midnight Express to resort to dirty tactics to gain the advantage while continuing to slow down the pace & double team to keep it before the momentum would trade back & forth between both teams. This wasn't their best encounter but definitely a quality match. June '90
<p> NWA United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Ric Flair - While Luger & Flair have had countless encounters throughout their career for the World Championship, this was a different match than all of them as Luger was the champion while Flair was the challenger as he wanted to win the title to become the #1 contender to WCW Champion Sting. Luger showed his power advantage early on with constant full body press slams on Flair before Flair cheated to get the advantage & worked over Luger's back to take away his power by throwing him into the guardrail numerous times while Flair also targeted Luger's leg using the ringpost as well before Luger got a heavy adrenaline rush & continued to use his power against Flair including a middle rope superplex. This is definitely a "lost" match in their long term series of matches in NWA/WCW but wasn't up there with the quality of their World Title matches. Sept. '90
<p> The Young Pistols & Z-Man vs. The Fabulous Freebirds - The Freebirds were doing the "rock band" gimmick at this time with their manager being "Diamond" Dallas Page, road manager being Big Daddy Dink (Sir Oliver Humperdink), and the recently added masked third member in Badstreet. This match was too quick to really make anything of note past it showcasing the speed of the Pistols & Z-Man. June '91
<p> 15-Man Battle Royal - This was just an average battle royal that really didn't have any standout moments past serving it's purpose in trying to establish El Gigante as the next Andre The Giant however it was interesting to see various wrestlers before the more famous runs in the business like Dustin "Goldust" Rhodes ("The Natural"), Kevin Nash (Oz), and Steve Austin ("Stunning"). Sept. '91
<p> WCW United States Champion Sting vs. Rick Rude - Rick Rude came to WCW a month earlier at Halloween Havoc alongside Paul E. Dangerously & Madusa declaring his intentions of gaining the United States Championship while also during this time, Sting was receiving various gifts while also having a bounty put on out him from a mystery person who was revealed earlier in the night to be Lex Luger who attacked Sting's previously injured leg to the point where he was in the hospital only to return for this match with his leg wrapped up. Sting was fighting on adrenaline as they fought on the ramp with Sting slamming Rude on it before doing a hit & move strategy while hopping on one leg as Rude did focus on the knee with clips & using the ringpost while Dangerously got involved as well but Sting just couldn't overcome the odds against him due to the earlier attack. This was more to just get the title off him as he would focus on the Luger & the World Championship after this match but this would also be the first match in the classic feud between Sting & Rude in WCW. I would have preferred their 30 minute "King Of Cable" tournament encounter at the Clash a year later but this was more important in terms of a significance. Nov. '91
<p> 2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: WCW/NWA Tag Team Champions Hollywood Blondes vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Despite Ric Flair returning to WCW months earlier at the SuperBrawl III PPV, this was actually his in-ring return. Austin & Pillman kept mocking Flair & Anderson in regards to their age at times only for both men to respond with their trademark fist & chops as Flair looked like he hadn't lost a step causing the Blondes to work over Anderson's knee with moves like the half crab. Both teams traded momentum back & forth throughout the match as "old timers" in the Horsemen kept up with the younger Blondes & even had them beat at various times throughout the match. June '93 [Stone Cold Truth]
<p> Brian Pillman vs. Steve Austin - Only a short time after the previous match would Pillman injure his ankle while the Blondes would not only lose the tag titles but also break up as a team when Austin chose Col. Parker as his manager over Pillman as his partner. Pillman jumped Austin in the ring before the bell & brought the fight to Austin including a hard chop that knocked him down before Austin was able to gain some offense working over the ankle with moves like the half crab. Both men went back & forth from here before Col. Parker would once again be the factor in the issue between both men here. The match wasn't long but really came off as a high intense grudge match. Nov. '93 [Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]
<p> WCW Television Champion Steven Regal vs. Dustin Rhodes - Before the days of William Regal & Goldust, they met here in a match with a 15 minute time limit that was a real technical match from start to finish with both men grounding each other while working the same pace throughout the match before Dustin realized that time was running out & picked up the pace while Regal tried to use the rules to his advantage as the champion.
