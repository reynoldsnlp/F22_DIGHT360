<h> Men 'Impersonating Cops' Turn Out to be Law Enforcement
<p> The Port Washington Police Department has determined that two people -- who were thought to be pretending to be undercover police officers in Port on Friday -- actually were law enforcement agents from a different unit investigating a case.
<p> Two men who approached a woman behind her garage on Friday, identifying themselves as undercover police officers and inquiring about garage thefts, turned out to be legitimate law enforcement personnel.
<p> The Port Washington Police Department on Friday sent out a press release about the incident that happened in the 800 block of North Wisconsin Street, seeking information about the two men who were wearing lanyards, flashed a badge, asked questions about the woman's habits at home and then left on foot.
<p> By Monday, Port police "determined that the individuals are representatives of a legitimate law enforcement agency working a case," according to a new press release.
<p> Police Chief Kevin Hingiss said there has not been a single garage theft in Port Washington, and he cannot reveal further details about the case because it is an ongoing investigation.
<p> ""Port police determined that the individuals are representatives of a legitimate law enforcement agency working a case"" - How about telling us what agency they're from? Certainly you can do that without concern for "revealing further details about the case because it is an ongoing investigation".
<p> I was actually interviewed by channel 4 about the 2 guys. They had the wrong address because they thought I was the female, but they wanted to talk to me anyway. I never made it on the news, but my car and the garage did. lol
