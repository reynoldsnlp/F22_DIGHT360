<h> Darwin Holiday Accommodation
<p> Coast is a typical 1970's tropical Darwin elevated home which has been upgraded with modern furnishings and airconditioning throughout - providing a relaxed beach-house feel. The property features three Queen bedrooms and one bedroom which contains two single beds. Coast offers much more than a standard hotel room, with a whole of house experience. Coast is perfectly located in arguably Darwin's best street. It is within a stone throw of the CBD, has sensational CBD and Harbour Views and is a quiet culdesac. It is a perfect location for a relaxed Darwin interlude.
