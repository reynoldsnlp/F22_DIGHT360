<p> A rare micro-organism that lives in the sludge of a Norwegian lake is mankind's most remote relative, according to biologists at the University of Oslo.
<p> The microscopic creature was first found in Lake As about 150 years ago, but more recent genetic analysis has revealed that the organism does not fit on any of the main branches of the tree of life. The protozoan creature is not a fungus, alga, parasite, plant or animal.
<p> "We have found an unknown branch of the tree of life that lives in this lake. It is unique," said Kamran Shalchian-Tabrizi, head of the Microbial Evolution Research Group at the university. He's created a new branch on the tree, and named it "Collodictyon".
<p> "So far we know of no other group of organisms that descend from closer to the roots of the tree of life than this species."
<p> Life on Earth can be divided up into two main groups. Bacteria falls under prokaryotes, which have no membrane inside their cell. Everything else, like animal, plants, fungi and algae, is a eukaryote because their cells have a membrane. The family tree of the species from Lake As starts at the very root of the eukaryote group.
<p> "The micro-organism is among the oldest, currently living eukaryote organisms we know of. It evolved around one billion years ago, plus or minus a few hundred million years. It gives us a better understanding of what early life on Earth looked like.", said Shalchian-Tabrizi.
<p> It's also unique in the way that it moves. Most cells have one or two flagella -- whip-like appendages that help cells move. Human sperm cells have one, while plants, algae and excavates originally had two flagella. This distant relative has four.
<p> For the study, professor Dag Klaveness bred millions of the tiny organisms to analyse its genes. He says the creatures eat algae, and prefer cannibalism to socialising. The protozoans are only 30-50 micrometres long. and -- so far -- have not been found anywhere other than this lake, 30 kilometres south of Oslo.
<p> A team of cognitive neuroscientists has identified the areas of the brain responsible for processing specific words meanings, bringing us one step closer to developing multilingual mind reading machines
