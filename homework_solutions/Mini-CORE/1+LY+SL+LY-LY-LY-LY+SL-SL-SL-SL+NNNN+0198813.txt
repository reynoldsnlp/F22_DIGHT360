<h> Ugly In The Morning Lyrics - Faith No More
<p> You did one thing wrong You woke up. It looked better before More-more And the stomach turns... Say nothing without wasting a word I know exactly what you meant I know how piggy feels He starves without missing a meal Look in the mirror... Don't look at me- I'm ugly in the morning When the headache is gone, The sun is not. Forgot to turn the alarm On-on Doesn't matter how much you think Or the number of hairs in the sink I did it to myself again I know how piggy feels He starves without missing a meal It's getting clearer... Don't look at me- I'm ugly in the morning
