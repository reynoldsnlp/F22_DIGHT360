<h> Book Description
<p> Release Date: September 20, 2010
<p> The edited, annotated diary of President Jimmy Carter -- filled with insights into his presidency, his relationships with friends and foes, and his lasting impact on issues that still preoccupy America and the world
<p> Each day during his presidency, Jimmy Carter made several entries in a private diary, recording his thoughts, impressions, delights, and frustrations. He offered unvarnished assessments of cabinet members, congressmen, and foreign leaders; he narrated the progress of secret negotiations such as those that led to the Camp David Accords. When his four-year term came to an end in early 1981, the diary amounted to more than five thousand pages. But this extraordinary document has never been made public -- until now.
<p> By carefully selecting the most illuminating and relevant entries, Carter has provided us with an astonishingly intimate view of his presidency. Day by day, we see his forceful advocacy for nuclear containment, sustainable energy, human rights, and peace in the Middle East. We witness his interactions with such complex personalities as Ted Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Joe Biden, Anwar Sadat, and Menachem Begin. We get the inside story of his so-called "malaise speech," his bruising battle for the 1980 Democratic nomination, and the Iranian hostage crisis. Remarkably, we also get Carter's retrospective comments on these topics and more: thirty years after the fact, he has annotated the diary with his candid reflections on the people and events that shaped his presidency, and on the many lessons learned.
<p> Carter is now widely seen as one of the truly wise men of our time. Offering an unprecedented look at both the man and his tenure, this fascinating book will stand as a unique contribution to the history of the American presidency.

<h> Review
<p> "Fascinating...The pace gives a sense of what it is like to be president, and the entries contain blunt appraisals of the people with whom he dealt." -- The New York Times "Outstanding...Anyone seeking insight into the thirty-ninth president of the United States would do well to pick up [this] book." -- The Christian Science Monitor "A substantial contribution to [history]... a uniquely unfiltered look at what occupying the Oval Office day to day means." -- Los Angeles Times "[Carter's] tart wit and cutting candor add flavor to a revealing portrait of presidential achievement." -- Publishers Weekly
<p> I was expecting this book to closely mirror President Carter's well-written and introspective presidential memoir, " Keeping Faith: Memoirs of a President ." While the underlying presidential timeline is obviously the same, the content in White House Dairy is entirely different.
<p> In "Keeping Faith," President Carter explains that in writing his memoir, he frequently referenced his diary, and he often includes diary entries directly in the text. These selections compliment the narrative very well, and illustrate the thought process behind some of his decisions. However, the diary selections in "Keeping Faith" consist of just a sentence or two here or there. Also, "Keeping Faith" was written in 1982, so while still relevant, many of its discussions have become dated.
<p> While "White House Diary" is not an unabridged copy of every single diary entry, it does provide thorough, comprehensive coverage of Carter's presidency. I don't know of any other modern US president who has given us this level of access to their private thoughts and feelings. The writing style is classic Jimmy Carter: intelligent yet easy to read, slightly stiff yet completely honest. This hardcover book's layout and quality are top-notch, including dozens of black & white photos; some familiar, some that I don't recall ever having seen.
<p> The text is organized in an intuitive manner. Diary entries comprise the majority of the text, which is printed in standard font. Notes about the diary passages are indicated by italics, and are very helpful. This is where Carter ties in relevant personal thoughts, past and present leaders and political players, and current events. Rather than being a distraction, these italicized notes are quite helpful and serve as a kind of a guide throughout the book. A good example of this mentioned by Carter is the 1978 FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), which Congress passed and which Carter supported, but which was circumvented by President Bush in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.
<p> If you're considering buying this book, you're likely beguiled by some of the suspicious, one star reviews here on Amazon. I'd like to address this before I continue with my own review.
<p> The latest tactic from conservative extremists is to criticize and demean anyone who has a differing political bent. It's a sad and distasteful way to represent the proud party of Lincoln; himself a gentleman and free thinker. In the spirit of free speech and intelligent discourse, there is certainly a place to argue the merits and deficiencies of our leaders. But a book review of any merit will focus on matters of writing style, content, and narrative; that's why it's called a "book review" and not a "cable news debate". Further, it lacks a fair and balanced sense of integrity if one criticizes a book they have never read. The lack of genuine content in these reviews makes this fact embarrassingly obvious. And, really, intelligent people of any political stripe deserve more than a bizarre rant.
<p> My advice as a fellow reader and consumer is to ignore BOTH five-star reviews as well as those with a negative agenda and pay special attention to those in between. I often find excellent feedback there; the result of fair and vigorous assessment. Kudos are given where due and appropriately backed. Similarly, weaknesses are addressed without sentimentality or reservation.
<p> Here's what I like about Carter's writing:
<p> 1) It's simple, concise, and nicely crafted. Only meaningful details and descriptions make their way into the author's prose. He's not flowery. He's not sparse. It's the right balance which makes for an accessible and engaging read.
<p> 2) The subject matter itself, with its broad scope of well-known figures and behind-the-scenes details, makes this the kind of insightful "tell all" that an adult won't be ashamed to read. :) Indeed, there is much to be culled about human nature, leadership, and negotiating from Carter's experiences.
<p> 3) The author is bold and frank enough to highlight his mistakes, shortcomings, and painful lessons. In this way, there is no pretense or vanity which might isolate the reader from the protagonist's journey. In fact, one feels like they are "in the thick of it" with the president; sharing the same experience and learning the same lessons.
<p> 4) This is a book that could have been dry and self-important. Instead, it reads like an elegant adventure through the halls of Washington power and over the world stage of public opinion. Engrossing.
<p> No book is perfect but I'm giving "White House Diary" a solid four stars. It's worth your money and a terrific read.
<p> President Carter's latest book, White House Diary, is an rare look into the daily operations of the White House and Presidential Management Style. Any student of the Presidency should read this book with an open mind, as rare as that may be today. Carter simply presents his daily diary entries, no edits, no deletions. For many entries he includes updates and historic perspective. Should give everyone a better understanding of the unique challenges a President faces each day he/she's in office.
