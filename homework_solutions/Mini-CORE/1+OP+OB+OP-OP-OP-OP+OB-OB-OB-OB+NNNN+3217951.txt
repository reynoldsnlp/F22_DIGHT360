<h> Uncommon Priors
<h> In Soviet Russia, blog hits you.
<p> Does it strike anyone else here as a bizarre pathology of capitalism that people can suddenly start suffering because other people start *thinking differently* even as the levels of technology, natural resources, and available labor stay the same? Not that this is in any way an original thought, of course, but this is what happens when you watch The Matrix for the ten-squillionth time on a plane.. Makes for a weird way in which relations of production fetter the productive forces, though, alas, I can hear Hayek screaming at me about the impossibility of doing better.
