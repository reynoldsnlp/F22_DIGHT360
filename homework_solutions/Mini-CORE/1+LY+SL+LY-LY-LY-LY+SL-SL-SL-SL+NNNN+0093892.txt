<p> As far as you know I've gotten over you And I bet it makes it easier, bet you're so relieved. And you let me go yea, I made a clean goodbye. Like it didn't even faze me no, I didn't even cry. Cause it's not all about you. no. I've got a face to save to. chorus So when I get hold of it and I get to thinking bout what you did and I come home swinging and I burn all your letters tear all the linens break all the mirrors as if you were in them and stop. Take a breath take a breath take control. cause you know me im good to go As far as you know everythings a ok cause all I let you see is the smile I fake No body knows how much I hurt inside cause I keep it in the closet I hold my head up high. Wont be my pride that I lose. No no. Lay Down and die I refuse. [Chorus] As far as you know im missing you tonight As far as you know yea. In this Twisted little mind.. When I get hold of it and I get to thinking bout what you did and I come home swinging I trash all the ... That you gave me smash em and crush em and go totally crazy. ...The walls rip out the walls I cant help thinking bout smashing your doors and I stop
