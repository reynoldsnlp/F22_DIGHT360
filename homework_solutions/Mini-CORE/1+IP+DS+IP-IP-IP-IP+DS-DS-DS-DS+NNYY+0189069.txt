<p> She Stoops to Conquer Now playing until November 18, 2012 | Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage
<p> A bawdy romp
<p> Romantic tomfoolery and mistaken identities abound in Goldsmith's classic comedy of manners. When shy-with-the ladies Charles Marlow sets off to the country to meet his blind date, Kate Hardcastle, a practical joke convinces him that Hardcastle manor is a luxury inn. Treating one's prospective in-laws as hired help is hardly advisable, but when it appears that Charles is quite a charmer with women of a lesser station, mayhem ensues and love blossoms.
<p> From the popular humourist David Sedaris comes this merrily wicked tale of his tour of duty as an elf at Macy's Santaland. From posts as Vomit Corner Elf to Water Cooler Elf to Cash Register Elf, Sedaris works his way up the candy-cane ladder and lives to share his hysterical, behind-the-scenes anecdotes. Both outlandish and illuminating, this sardonic comedy is a holiday treat for adults.
<p> "Every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings." In this holiday favourite , George Bailey's guardian angel swoops in to remind him that faith, hope, and family make life truly wonderful. Returning for a fifth year, our production has delighted over 70,000 audience members!
<p> The beloved holiday favourite that has brought joy to more than 100,000 audience members is back! Make your days merry and bright by warming to this unforgettable musical about love and friendship. Based on the classic film, this tap-dancing delight brims with tunes -- including "Blue Skies," "Sisters," and the ever-popular "White Christmas" -- that will fill you with the spirit of the season.
<p> Those crazy kids from the Arts Club's smash hit Sexy Laundry are back! And this time Henry and Alice are camping -- sort of! Forced to examine their relationship in the tangle of the wilderness -- including collapsing tents, uninvited guests, and their own particular style of alfresco "cuisine" -- they just might discover how to survive a true mid-life crisis.
<p> A high school chamber choir from Uranium, Saskatchewan, perishes in a freak roller-coaster accident, and the Amazing Karnack, a mechanized fortune-teller, feels responsible. To make amends, he brings the teens back to life to sing about their thwarted dreams and desires in one final concert. Created by Victoria's Atomic Vaudeville, the wildly imaginative and darkly hilarious Ride the Cyclone is already being lauded as a contemporary musical masterpiece .
<p> Bernard, a successful architect in swinging sixties Paris, is even more successful with the ladies. In fact, he juggles the hearts of three air hostesses who jet in and out of his groovy bachelor pad: Gloria, Gabriella, and Gretchen -- aka "America," "Italy," and "Germany." But when Boeing introduces a faster jet, Bernard's precise romantic timetable goes hysterically off course and turbulence looms.
<p> A seductive mystery woman, an accusation of murder, a missing finger, and a mad dash to foil foreign spies! Four gifted actors play over 150 zany characters in this Monty Python-flavoured Hitchcock spoof that just might give you vertigo!
<p> Marcus Youssef has a "difficult" relationship with his mother, Roleene. When the playwright discovers a storage locker full of her journals, he begins to delve into her history -- and his own. Filled with humour, tension, and affection , How Has My Love Affected You? questions the nature of familial obligation: what do we owe to each other, and what do we owe to ourselves?
<p> This is the laugh-out-loud autobiographical story that has become one of Canada's most successful theatrical productions. In this farewell run, the creators/stars Ted and Richard propel you through comically poignant vignettes of their childhood piano lessons -- complete with virtuoso displays of technique -- and share the triumphs and tortures of being extraordinarily good failed musicians. Not just for music nerds, 2 Pianos 4 Hands is for anyone who has ever strived to achieve a goal.
<p> Based on Farrant's memoir of her fourteenth summer, My Turquoise Years is a comic coming-of-age story set in 1960, a time of postwar optimism, when plastic reigned and the colour turquoise was the height of chic. Marion, raised by Aunt Elsie in sleepy Cordova Bay, has grown up hearing tales of her glamorous, globe-trotting mother, Nancy. Just as Marion is blossoming into womanhood, Nancy suddenly announces a visit to Canada, throwing everyone into a tizzy.
<p> Irregular hats for cats, mounted lobsters, autographed copies of the Bible: this premiere from composer Veda Hille and the CBC's Bill Richardson explores what humanity has to offer and turns it into sidesplitting musical fare. Who wouldn't want a broken time machine, for free? Come and take a look at the vagaries and intimacies of the internet!
<p> Full of onstage joy and backstage drama, the musical Dreamgirls tells the rags-to-riches tale of a 1960s girl group, loosely based on The Supremes. Young, black, and with talent to burn, the hopeful divas Effie, Deena, and Lorrell fantasize about playing the Apollo Theater. After getting their big break, The Dreamettes seem unstoppable -- until rivalry and betrayal enter the group. Share their elation and tribulations on the road to stardom, told through the unforgettable sounds of Motown .
<p> Irreverently witty and outright uproarious , Avenue Q is the musical story of Princeton, a bright-eyed college graduate who arrives in New York City looking for love, a job, and his purpose in life. The only neighbourhood he can afford is the multicultural Avenue Q, where Sesame Street -esque puppets rub shoulders with humans. Part felt, part flesh, Avenue Q is packed with songs that are surprisingly poignant and only occasionally PC.
