<p> This question just stumps the mind for some reason. Well it's an amalgamation of progressive/psychedelic/alternative/pop Rock. There, that's the best I can do. Just buy the EP and press play for a far better evaluation of our sound!
<p> - How have you found the response to the new EP so far?
<p> It's been amazing. Only insiders and some music writers have heard it so far but we'll find out more about the reaction now that it just got released. We're very proud of it that's for sure.
<p> - The record sees Terry Brown on producing duties so what were you looking for in your producer for this record?
<p> Terry took us under his wing in 2010 and from the first moment we knew it was the right marriage.
<p> He's been there since the birth of Rock N' Roll and the British invasion and worked on some of the biggest albums in history so that makes the decision quite simple.
<p> As our producer, Terry fully understands the global goals and ambitions we have for our music and our future and that's an incredibly powerful and fortunate place to be as a band.
<p> - He has worked with the likes of Rush so how did you find working with him? And what did his experience bring to this record?
<p> Terry has helped us find our sound and become comfortable and confident in the music we want to put out to the world.
<p> When we went into the studio for the first time it was a bit overwhelming.
<p> I mean fuck, the guy has worked with Rush and The Who and so many other giants of the music world and here we are in the same shoes, inspiring to say the least.
<p> - You have covered Another Brick In The Wall where you have changed some of the lyrics so how surprised are you at the way that this track and video has gone viral?
<p> To tell you the truth, when we finished the track and video, we all took a deep breath and thought "wow, this is going to make a huge wave" and it did.
<p> It became an anthem for the youth in Iran and the Middle East and still plays a role in the uprisings taking place there. As our first ever release, we certainly jumped into the global scene with both feet.
<p> - You sought the permission of Roger Waters to makes the change to the lyrics so what was his initial reaction?
<p> When Roger released a public statement about his support for us and what we had done with the song, that really was an amazing moment.
<p> I remember we were so excited when we read it and thought how incredible it is that one of our biggest heroes and influences is backing us up. His words were "I'm proud to be a small part of this resistance". Too fucking cool!
<p> - This song highlights the repressive and brutal regime in Iran so how important is it for you personally to be able to take a stand with the music that you release?
<p> It's something we have set out to do from the start. Being inspired by the likes of John Lennon, Bob Marley, Roger Waters, Bob Dylan, and many other artists who incorporated social justice into their music, we would be fooling ourselves if it wasn't a part of our creative process.
<p> We believe whole-heartedly that music is the most powerful tool we humans possess and combined with the reach of celebrity, well that's a potion for changing the world right there and we intend to use it with great conviction.
<p> - Sepp and Sohl you both fled Iran as children so how has your past had an impact on the music you make and also how you see the world?
<p> It certainly helped shape our global outlook on life. When life begins with that much chaos and uncertainty, it's tough to find a stable ground to lift off from.
<p> But at the same time, if it wasn't for our past we would not have discovered the music and musicians that lead our journey to where we are today. John Lennon taught us to be dreamers. Hope became an ever-present concept in our songwriting.
<p> - So how did the band form?
<p> Well Sohl and I met Joel Lightman in 2008 through an advert in the paper. Joel had just come over from London. We were looking for a keyboardist and luckily Joel was looking for a band so we came together.
<p> The three of us spent the next two years looking for a drummer who would anchor us and really propel the rhythmic side of the music forward.
<p> It was a hellish process and something right out of Spinal Tap. Mob looking dudes, dwarfs, some bloke who wouldn't say a word, another who was on so much coke he wouldn't shut up, again a hellish process.
<p> It was in 2010 that Terry suggested we go check out a drummer named Ben Riley, performing at a tiny little club in Toronto. That was it for us. The first verse we heard him play and we knew he was the one to bring Blurred Vision to completion.
<p> Most recently, we met guitarist Mike Bongertman who joined the group in the summer of 2011 and made us the 5 piece line-up you see today.
<p> There is a great bond between all of us, almost more a family than a band. That's what makes it so easy. No ego, just brothers on the same mission.
<p> - How does the song-writing work within the band - is there one main writer or is it very much a collaborative effort?
<p> Sohl and I write all the songs and lyrics. When we work out somewhat of a structure we take it into the studio as a full band and everyone works their parts around the song.
<p> A lot of it is instinctive. When Ben hears the chord changes and rhythm of the guitar and melody of the lyrics, more often than not he knows what he wants to do with it rhythmically.
<p> We believe in one another's interpretations of where a song needs to go so it's just a matter of working out the details.
<p> Once we're somewhat comfortable with it Terry will come in and do his thing. Tell us whether it's working or not and if not then what we need to do to make it work.
<p> It's quite a process from birth to finished product but well worth the struggle, most of the time anyway.
<p> - And where did your love of music and the dream of playing rock and roll start?
<p> It's different with all of us really. Ben's dad was a legend in his own right playing with Ray Charles, Ringo Starr, Bob Seger, and many others. He was truly born into it all.
<p> I saw a video of Pink Floyd live from the Delicate Sound Of Thunder tour that Sohl had brought home. It was the mid 90's and I was only 13 at the time.
<p> Sohl put it on and the first image of David Gilmour playing guitar on Shine On You Crazy Diamond and I was hooked. That really was it for me.
<p> I knew at that very moment that music would be my calling. Sohl was always into the arts.
<p> From an early age he was into music and being the younger brother, I would always get introduced to bands from him.
<p> Rock and Roll really does pick you and not the other way round. It's a dangerous love affair of the highest sorts and will beat you to the ground, leave you feeling helpless, worthless, lost, and keep you coming back and begging for more!
<p> - You have also been working with WhyHunger charity so can you tell me how and why you got involved with them?
<p> Whyhunger is the sort of organisation that gives you hope for the future that things will be alright. The growing statistics of hunger and poverty in America is devastatingly hard to take.
<p> Whyhunger is there to make sure that the importance of healthy food and the right to it is etched into the foundations of our societies.
<p> It should be without a doubt a law that no child should ever go hungry in this world. Whyhunger is trying to make that happen and we want to do everything we can to help them reach that goal.
<p> Our track "Dear John", which we wrote in memory of our great hero John Lennon, sees all its download sales go towards Whyhunger and to the "Imagine There's No hunger" campaign which was launched by Yoko Ono and Hard Rock International. We are so proud and honoured to be a part of the Whyhunger family.
<p> - You have an ever growing fanbase so for those fans reading this interview do you have a message for them?
<p> In the words of the wonderful Eric Idle - "Always look on the bright side of life".
<p> - And are we going to be seeing you play some live shows in the UK any time soon?
<p> Well Helen, how funny you should ask. We will be "coming home" as we like to say and playing our first major UK tour that kicks off November 24-December 17.
<p> Just visit our facebook page for all the dates and deets to each show as they get announced in the coming weeks - http://www.facebook.com/blurredvisionmus\\...
<p> - Finally what's next for you?
<p> Release of the debut EP(which everyone should definitely go and buy/download:), touring the UK, touring the States, releasing the debut album in 2013, touring the world and finally world domination!!! In that exact order, hehe!
