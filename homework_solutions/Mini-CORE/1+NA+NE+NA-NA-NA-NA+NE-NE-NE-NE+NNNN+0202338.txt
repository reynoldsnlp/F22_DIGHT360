<p> Should the pillar of the local community top the poll in Northamptonshire, the Home Secretary would order an immediate re-run.
<p> Because Theresa May's flawed law disqualifies Labour's Barron, a respected local magistrate and former councillor, over a teenage 20 fine for a minor offence in 1990.
<p> The trade unionist's presence on the ballot paper, in a contest he'd lose if he wins, captures the ridiculousness of a Conservative plan likely to end in a -self-inflicted bloody nose for David Cameron.
<p> The Prime Plod excelled himself even by his own -incompetent standards in accepting Nick Clegg's timetable and holding the elections in November.
<p> Polling booth staff should take a newspaper to read because fewer than nine hours of daylight isn't going to have them queuing out of the door to vote.
<p> The turnout, in a race nobody wanted except misguided Tory policy wonkers, threatens to be the lowest ever for national -elections, below the 23% of the 1999 European elections.
<p> Liberal -Democrats can't be bothered to raise the party's standard in all 41 areas outside London.
<p> Cameron's dream of law and order zealots sweeping the board may be a nightmare if Labour successfully turns the elections into local referendums on police cuts, Miliband's party gaining a toe-hold to kick Tory MPs out of Parliament.
<p> And we can all take direct action by voting with our hard earned cash.
<p> I'm boycotting Amazon and Starbucks until they tip up tax.
<p> Google's harder to avoid, but I'll still be giving it grief.
<h> Auntie is all right
<p> DON'T be fooled by Right-whingers using the BBC crisis to neuter the broadcaster.
<p> Portraying the Beeb as Left-wing has been a persistent calumny since Lord Reith first twiddled the knobs in 1922.
<p> If anything Auntie is an -establishment creature whose highly paid staff are more interested in their own top tax rate than the tax credits of lowly paid workers.
<p> Dominant big names such as Jeremy Clarkson and Andrew Neil are both terrific broadcasters yet are also on the Right of British politics. BBC chair Lord Chris Patten is a Tory grandee, architect of John Major's 1992 election victory.
<p> Conservatives and their media allies demand Patten's head not because he's Right-wing but he's not Right-wing enough for their prejudices.
<p> For what it's worth, I think Patten should stay and sort out the mess then resign.
<p> Neil or David Dimbleby could be a smart choice as Director-General.
<p> But please spare us the Right-whinge guff about a Left-wing BBC.
<h> Tories wrong to demand law be ignored
<p> TORY MPs demanding the law be ignored and Abu Qatada be bundled out of Britain on a plane are hypocrites.
<p> The moment a trade union fails to dot an i or cross a t they shout the law must be obeyed.
<p> Obeying the rule of law is a cornerstone of democracy, and that includes respecting it with figures as hateful as Abu Qatada.
