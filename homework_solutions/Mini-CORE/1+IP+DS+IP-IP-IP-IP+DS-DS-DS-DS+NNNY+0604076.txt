<p> Whether you're just starting with colour analysis or personal style, planning to start your own image business, or already established, are you:
<p> Feeling overwhelmed with too much to do?
<p> Wanting to check with someone else how you're doing with your colour and style skills ?
<p> Needing to build your confidence ?
<p> Struggling to find customers ?
<p> I've been through all the above, and lots more besides, so I know how you feel.
<p> You're probably sat there wondering how on earth you're going to get your business known so that you attract a never-ending stream of happy customers and an income to match.
<p> I've poured far too much time and money down the drain on useless marketing because I didn't have a clue what I was doing.
<p> I spent years like that until I finally invested in a personal mentor and only then did my business begin to finally take off.
<p> My mentors have taught me how to put together a successful business that suits ME. Now I work with the people I want to, when I want to, where I want to, and how I want to.
<p> So what are you going to do about it? Getting grumpy about your lack of success won't solve anything. Hiding under the duvet certainly won't help either.
<h> So why not let me help you?
<p> I want you to know how someone looking in from the outside can see so much more than you ever could. That's exactly what happened to me, and it changed my life and my business forever.
<p> I've been mentoring image consultants (and other businesses too) for many years and what I can bring to you is 32 years' experience of running my own image, colour and style business and training hundreds of consultants across the globe.
<p> There's an incredible amount of insider business and marketing knowledge here that you can access which could propel your business forward faster than you ever thought possible. But only... if you would like me to help you.
<h> You have two options:
<h> Option #1
<h> Purchase Colour Analysis Training in a Box (option 3 or 4) or Ladies' Style Training in a Box (option 3 or 4)
<h> and I will include the following extra Colour or Style package worth GBP 2,579 at absolutely no additional cost to you...
<h> Total value GBP 2,579.00 at no cost to you!
<p> This crazy offer is limited to just 10 Colour or Style packages and the offer ends when the 10 packages are sold, so act now to avoid disappointment.
<p> *Colour training and your own personal colour consultation will be provided with your purchase of Colour Analysis in a Box. Style training and your own personal style consultation will be provided with your purchase of Ladies' Style in a Box
<h> Option #2
<p> If you've already successfully trained in seasonal and / or tonal colour analysis and / or style and shape, but still want one of the extra Colour or Style packages then I have an extra special price for you too.
