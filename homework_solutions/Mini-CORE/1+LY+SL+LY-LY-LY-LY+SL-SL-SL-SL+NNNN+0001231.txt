<p> Come here, my love I'll tell you a secret Come closer, now I want you to believe it I'll tell you all the things You want to hear Don't worry, baby There's nothing to fear Hey, little girl Would you like some candy? Look into my eyes I've seen it all Hand in hand Together we fall We'll sing and dance And we'll find romance And we'll stroll to the edge of the world Come sit right down Lay your head on my shoulder It's not the point That I'm forty years older You can trust me I'm no criminal But I'd kill my mother To be with you We'll sing and dance And we'll find romance And we'll stroll to the edge of the world Give me a smile Let me see those pearlies I'll do anything For the little girlies...

<p> General Comment: Of course it's about a peadophile, most of FNM's songs have dark humour in them, the 'edge of the world' line refers to the naivity of the victim, they may as well think the world is flat.
<p> General Comment: as we know patton and co have always left their lyrics to the intereptation of the listner, and you can take many things from this song.
<p> Musically its great, it has that piano- jazz vibe that is really seductive, and the lyrics can be seen as an older man falling for a much younger woman as a lolita type scenrio, or you can see it as an obbession for another person
<p> I see what 7 strings says there about "We'll sing and dance and we'll find romance" as a rock concert but I took it also as an escape, somewhere that they are free to be themselves without judgement.
<p> And I do agree, I do see at as the lure of rock n roll, the touring as in "Edge Of The World"
<p> General Comment: Pikki has it right. It is about a someone in their late teens and a much older man. If you want to keep the pedophile image, that is okay. The song is still very cool and I have seen a fair amount of bands cover it on YouTube.
<p> General Comment: I agree with frankie fuko iv. " We'll sing and dance, And we'll find romance" Sounds like a rock concert to me ;D Also, I think "kill my own mother to be with you" is the fascination that some girls in the audience have for the performers. "Ive seen it all" and "I'll do anything for the little girlies" sounds like a rockstar who has had a lot of groupies and see a lot of shit. All in all ,I think the pedophile theme is to obvious and you have to remember that Patton is a master of making his words seem to mean one thing while actually meaning something completely different.
<p> General Comment: From what i gather, the song is about the lure of rock n roll...Patton's character is a sleazy devilish manifestation of rock n roll. The "40 years older" part points to the birth of rock..1950's...kill my mother has always been associated with "devil music". "Edge of the world"..referring to touring....and a bands primary market target..."little girlies".....call me crazy, but it all points to "buy me" Patton's metaphors....gotta love em! What an AWESOME song/album/band!!!
<p> General Comment: The music to this song is very beautiful, and the lyrics are quite contradictory. The way I see it, this song is through the pedophile's eyes, so why would it not be beautiful for him? Which leads me to my second opinion of this song. Although FNM do like to create very seemingly "distrubed" songs(see "Be Aggressive"), this song is possibly metaphorical.
<p> While the aforementioned "Be Aggressive" was written about male-on-male oral sex, this song I believe was actually written about looking through other people's eyes, who you might see as strange or disturbed, and while seeing through their eyes, catch a glimpse of beauty that you might not see through your own sight, and this is presented (as I said before) through metaphor...Life can be very limited.
<p> And that is why I believe this song is metaphorical. If I am implying that I support pedophiles, I am not of that intent; although I don't find it wrong or disturbed to follow your own heart and passions, succumbing to pedophilic acts is against the law and is very immoral.
