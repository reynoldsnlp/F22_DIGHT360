<p> In an ideal world every order we ship out would be perfect in every way, however we know from from time to time either we send out an incorrect item or you're simply not happy with an item when it arrives. Because of this we have a returns policy that lets you know, in addition to your statutory rights, how to go about returning goods to us that you aren't happy with.
<h> OUR 14 DAY GUARANTEE
<p> You can return any item bought at The Kerrang Online Store to us within fourteen days of receipt and get a refund or have the item exchanged. You can return it because you simply don't like it, because it didn't fit, because of a manufacturing fault or because we sent an item in error. Simply return it to us at:
<p> and we'll sort out the exchange or refund. Please remember to enclose your contact details and why you are returning the item to us.
<p> BEYOND OUR 14 DAY GUARANTEE PERIOD
<p> Sadly once the 14 day guarantee period has passed we can only accept items back that clearly have manufacturing faults. We aren't able to take back items that don't fit, where shipped wrongly or you simply didn't like once our guarantee period has ended. If your item has a manufacturing fault return it to the address above detailing the problem and we'll do our best to resolve it for you.
<p> EXCEPTIONS TO RETURNS POLICY
<p> There are one or two exceptions to our returns policy. Sadly we aren't able to accept returned items that have clearly been worn and washed (unless there is a manufacturing fault with them) or are soiled or dirty. We can't accept items back that (in our opinion) have been deliberately damaged or have been subject to excessive wear and tear. All returned items must be in un-worn condition and should be returned with the original packaging.
<p> SHIPPING AND RESTOCKING CHARGES
<p> Loudclothing reserves the right to charge customers a 1.00 re-stocking charge to cover the cost of dealing with returned items. When a customer exchanges an item we reserve the right to charge a 1.00 reshipping charge per item to cover the additional costs of shipping out the replacement item.
<p> LOST THE RETURNS FORM PRINTED ON YOUR DELIVERY NOTE?
