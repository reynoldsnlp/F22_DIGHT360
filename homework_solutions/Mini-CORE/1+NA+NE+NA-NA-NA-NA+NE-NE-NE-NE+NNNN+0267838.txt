<h> Union pleads with Scott to halt use of test scores to judge teachers
<p> Florida's push to use student test scores to judge teacher performance should be halted this year, with Gov. Rick Scott using his executive authority to put a stop to a faulty system, the state teachers union says.
<p> The Florida Education Association this week sent a letter to Scott asking him to suspend the requirement that "value-added" test data, sometimes dubbed VAM, be used in teacher evaluations.
<p> The union said the data are insufficient, possibly inaccurate and went to districts so late that evaluations for the 2011-12 school year are only now being sent to teachers -- five months after the school year wrapped up.
<p> "The deep concerns we have regarding the implementation of VAM's complicated and unproven statistical formula and its impact on Florida's teachers cannot be overstated," wrote Andy Ford, the union president.
<p> Ford could not be reached for additional comment. A Scott spokesman said the Governor's Office was reviewing the union's letter.
<p> Florida's new and controversial teacher merit-pay law requires that students' academic growth, as measured by test-score data, be a significant part of teachers' evaluations and eventually help determine their pay.
<p> The state's value-added model aims to analyze results from the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test in a way that determines an individual teacher's impact on student growth. It is designed to take into account factors outside the instructor's control, such as a student's absentee rate, while judging the teacher's influence on a child's test results.
<p> Teachers' 2011-12 evaluations were the first to be done under the new system, which also includes a new way to observe and judge their classroom activities.
<p> In Central Florida, most teachers have not yet received their final evaluations for last school year. But the Orange County school district said its value-added scores showed 95 percent of its teachers were "effective," a desired, though not the top, rating in the new system.
<p> The education association detailed five specific complaints about the data for the 2011-12 school year.
<p> The law envisioned that tests other than FCAT would be used to evaluate teachers whose students do not take that series of standardized exams, given to students in grades three to 10. But this year, only FCAT math and reading data were used in the new value-added model.
<p> That is insufficient when so many instructors -- whether they teach kindergarten, music or high-school economics -- aren't covered by FCAT's yearly math and reading exams, the letter said.
<p> It also complained that the Florida Department of Education wasn't able to get the data to school districts within 90 days after the close of the school year, as the law required.
<p> And it said the department told the district it knew some data might be inaccurate because students might have been inaccurately tied to a particular teacher. Because "errors can damage a teacher's career," Ford wrote, the state shouldn't proceed with using the data.
<p> Captain,   i can tell you teachers i know more than work for the low income they get.  I live with a math teacher that puts in easily 90 hours a week 10 months a year.  She is never without papers to grade, tests to make and required input to register.   She really has no life during the school year except preparing for the next day.   Numerous times students have failed in test at year end because they were already accepted into college and fail test without any effort at all given to the test.  We are talking about kids.  Holding teachers accountable for that just is not right.  One student never even completed 1 question on the test, just signed it and that's it.  Your going to lose teachers at an ever higher rate than they are leaving now if this is what's required.

<p> First, I would say that being a teacher is an incredibly difficult and often thankless job.  It requires patience, creativity, and an uncanny ability to do more with less.  My son goes to public school and is a straight "A" student.  He's more knowledgeable and is more disciplined because he's had great teachers throughout the years.
<p> All that being said - the world judges knowledge (and intelligence) through testing.  It's not always straight-forward testing like FCAT, but testing is the ultimate measuring stick.  Want to drive a car?  You have to take a driving test.  You want to go to college?  You'll be taking dozens of tests.  Want to become a US citizen?  You have to take a test.  Every student in every school in every country around the world is required to take and pass tests.  The same rule applies here in the US.  We measure the effectiveness of teachers based on how a student demonstrates his or her knowledge of the subject matter.  It doesn't matter that the kid is a slow learner.  It doesn't matter that they come from a single parent home or that they're poor.  In the end all that matters is whether or not the student can demonstrate that they understand and can apply the knowledge they've acquired in class.  If they cannot do that, the teacher failed that student - no matter what the reason might be. Is it fair? Maybe not.  But that's the way the world operates.

<p> Captain J.... does your job evaluation hinge on the performance of others, or just your actions? I have seen many instances of students purposely failing a test because they did not like their teacher. Should good teachers be paid more? Yes! Should poor teachers be paid the same or less? Yes! Should their pay be based on a standardized test that has been proven to be a failure? No!
