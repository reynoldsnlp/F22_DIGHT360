<p> I'm only human, I'm just a woman Help me believe in what I could be and all that I am Show me the stairway I have to climb Lord for my sake Teach me to take One day at a time
<p> One day at a time, sweet Jesus That's all I'm asking from you Just give me the strength to do every day what I have to do Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus Tomorrow may never be mine Lord help me today Show me the way One day at a time
<p> Do you remember When you walked among men Jesus, you know if you're looking below It's worse now than then Cheatin' and stealin', violence and crime So for my sake Teach me to take One day at a time
<p> One day at a time, sweet Jesus That's all I'm asking from you Just give me the strength to do every day what I have to do Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus Tomorrow may never be mine Lord help me today Show me the way One day at a time
