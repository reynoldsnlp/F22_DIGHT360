<h> For The First Time Lyrics
<p> This affection I feel is hard to understand It?s not the way I planned My world is changing Wherever I turn It?s his face I see Looking back at me And in my eyes I can?t disguise The affection I feel Is getting the better off me
<p> Oh for the first time it?s not a dream Oh for the first time it seems so real That I want to remember Every moment That I?m there beside him When he gently takes my hand So here I am Feeling things I?ve never felt And all because of him My world is changing
<p> Tarzan:
<p> She?s turned my whole world upside down
<p> Jane:
<p> Everything that I do I do to catch his eye Well and I won?t deny I stand here guilty
<p> Tarzan:
<p> I wonder if she feels the same
<p> Both: Is this affection (as) I feel
<p> Has gotten the better of me
<p> Both:
<p> So for the first time Can this be love? Oh for the first time I know it?s real
<p> Jane:
<p> And with him I feel
<p> Both:
<p> So completely Uniquely like no other As he gently holds me close
<p> Jane:
<p> But wait a minute What am I saying?
<p> Tarzan:
<p> Ne?er thought no
<p> Jane:
<p> I never thought On a scale so grand Tarzan:
<p> To be feeling Jane:
<p> Are these emotions Racing through me Tell me I must Tell me I can
<p> Tarzan:
<p> I never felt these things
<p> Both:
<p> I?m finding who I am Cause for the first time
<p> Jane:
<p> I have no doubt
<p> Tarzan:
<p> These things she does
<p> Both:
<p> But for the first time I understand, try to understand Yes for the first time I realise That all the things they strange/separate happened Well they?re happening to me
<p> Jane:
<p> Every time I?m with that man
<p> Tarzan:
<p> Every time I?m with her
<p> Jane:
<p> Every time I?m with
<p> Tarzan:
<p> Could I be
<p> Both:
<p> That man
