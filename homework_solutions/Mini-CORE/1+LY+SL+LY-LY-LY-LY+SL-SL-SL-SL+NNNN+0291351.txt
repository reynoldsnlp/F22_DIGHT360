<p> I'm so iconoclastic; I'm clastic! I only want you to think I'm fantastic. I'll participate in what you believe, If you give me the attention! Yeah, yeah that's the only compensation I want to be included in your conversation.
<p> So am I "in" or am I "out" What is there to think about? What is that paint brush for? Are you preparing to draw me? No wait, please don't! I am scared, Of what I'll see... I'm not a perfect picture portrait, But I am working on it! I've been thinking about being cool, I must have to admit!
<p> Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers in the clouds, But if wasn't for you, We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds. How am I suppose to choose, which one I belong to?
<p> I think I'll perpetuate a pre-existing runway, I guess it is all of the shit almost as cool as creating a fresh New elaboration yourself.
<p> It's a marker! It's a sign!
<p> It's something we define! It already exists, but you helped refine! [| From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/i/i-set-my-f\\... |] An emblem for all your aesthetic kin, To recognize you by!
<p> Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers in the clouds, But if wasn't for you, We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds. How am I suppose to choose, which one I belong to?
<p> Obscenity is a crutch for traffic drives. If you need to use the restroom just ask politely. I like the way I do it, better then the way your not. Lifting up the toilet seat was the way I was taught.
<p> It has to be a unanimous determination. Because one opinion would be a pointless appreciation.
<p> Yeah, sure thanks for the invitation! Don't want to be included in your conversation... It's to late! We've over thrown I took all your friends, And your all alone.
<p> Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers in the clouds, But if wasn't for you, We wouldn't have all these multiple crowds. How am I suppose to choose, which one I belong to?
