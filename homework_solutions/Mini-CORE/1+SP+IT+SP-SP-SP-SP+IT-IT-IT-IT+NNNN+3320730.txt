<p> My mum says garden gnomes make a house a home! Are you loud and proud in your love of garden gnomes at home, a closet gnomer or with a strict 'no gnomes' policy at your place?
<p> Every home should have a gnome. We had one that farted every time you walked past it.
<p> (Oh I soooo did not expect that from a woman who reminds me of my granny! But I want one of those gnomes!)
<p> What vegetable (or fruit) have you always wanted to grow at home?
<p> Well I'm the sort of gardener who has tomatoes in with the lavender, and pumpkins crawling over the lawn, but I did have a thing about growing a dragon fruit cactus. It's now taken over the back fence and I had six lovely red dragon fruits this year. Who's a clever girl then?
<p> (Clever? Perhaps if you'd whipped one up into something to eat.)
<p> If I came to your home and looked in the refrigerator, what would I find?
<p> I don't think that would be a very good idea. Something may fall out onto your foot. Probably the green paw-paw I crammed in there yesterday.
<p> If you sorted your wardrobe by colour, what colour would stand out? (Ahh, do you sort your wardrobe by colour?!)
<p> Er, no, I sort by season. What colour? Hang on a minute while I check... oh dear, not good... it's pinky/reddy/purple! Oh well, new season coming up. Maybe I'll change to bluey/greeny/yellow.
<p> What are you wearing now? (Be honest!)
<p> Okay -- honest -- beige, and pinky/purple. *Sigh*
<p> Whose home would you like to housesit and why?
<p> Hmm. I guess you're thinking I will choose a celebrity in a mansion overlooking the sea. 'Fraid not. I would choose my friend's small flat in Athens where I could ignore the housework.
<p> Country curiosities...
<p> We love a sunburnt country (slip, slop, slap and all that). What's your ideal hat? Or are you a boots person?
<p> I'm afraid I'm not a hat or boots person. However, living as I do in the Sunshine State, I have a sunhat which I wear outside when necessary. Unfortunately the cat slept on it so it looks a little bizarre. I really only wear sandals. I have two pairs, and a pair of sensible shoes for best, oh and my Titans mascot slippers -- that's the extent of my shoe wardrobe.
<p> If you were a tree (or animal) what kind of tree (animal) would you be?
<p> I'm sure my husband would tell you I would be a sloth, but I think I'd be a squirrel because I hoard everything. You should see my desk!
<p> Now for the big question... Why did the chicken cross the road?
<p> Ah! If he crossed the road to get to the other side, there must have been a good reason. I think it was because he saw a gorgeous, fluff-feathered hen, with a sexy double cluck!
<p> About you...
<p> Your turning point: when was that point in your life you realized being an author was no longer going to be just a dream but a reality and a career?
<p> Seriously -- I've written things all my life. I once wrote a pantomime for a dance company. I contributed a terrible sketch for a stage Revue. I devised a script adaptation of the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan through their music (actually staged). I wrote a column in an antique magazine about funny things that happened on the way to the Antique Fair, and another about the antique markets in London. I reviewed art exhibitions and edited a motor magazine. Stuff like that. But when we retired from our business, I was confronted with the horrible truth I would be home all day with nothing to do but the housework! Consequently I sat down and wrote my travel odyssey about Greece "Make Mine a Moussaka" and then went on to novels. Now I can't stop...
<p> (Mmm, yum, moussaka would've been nice.)
<p> What is the hardest part of writing for you?
<p> It's the terrible 'info dump.' Being a Virgo I need to have everything set out and explained -- so I am continually criticised for too much info gumpf.
<p> (Ah, yes, a fellow Virgo. I hear ya, Helen.)
<p> If someone was to write your biography, what do you think the title should be?
<p> "Aphrodite in Disguise"
<p> What question have you always wanted to be asked in an interview? How would you answer that question?
<p> Q: "Now that you have reached 100,000 book sales, can I have your autograph?"
<p> A: "Of course. Would you like it in black felt pen across your back?"
<p> Fun stuff...
<p> What does your protagonist think about you? Would he or she want to hang out with you, the author, his/her creator.
<p> I don't think any of my protagonists would want to hang out with me. For instance they wouldn't know if I had a one of those pepper spray things in my bag (like Stephanie Plum) or whether I was toting something more lethal. They know only too well that I am able to kill them off willy-nilly. And as I'm somewhat ditzy, this could happen at any time.
<p> If you could trade places with any other person for a week, famous or not famous, living or dead, real or fictional, with whom would it be?
<p> I think it would be with the young Julie Andrews. I always wanted to sing Maria in the "Sound of Music."
<p> If I said to you, "Just entertain me for five minutes, I'm not going to talk," what would you do?
<p> (Oh dear! This answer, following on from the sex scene above has me really scared.)
<p> What was the best thing before sliced bread?
<p> My grandmother's jam sponge.
<p> And in case you are wondering about when we first sliced bread...
<p> In 1912, a jeweller named Otto Frederick Rohwedder began working on the world's first bread slicer. Several years, and many unsuccessful models, later he devised a machine to slice bread AND also wrap it up to keep it from going stale.
<p> Perfectly timed with the invention of the pop-up toaster, Rohwedder sold his slicing and wrapping machine to the Chillicothe Baking Company in 1928.
<p> Name 5 uses for a stapler that has not staple pins.
<p> My stapler never has pins! Useless thing! So there isn't even one use for it, let alone 5!
<p> For more information about Helen - novelist, travel writer, photographer (and talent clearly runs in the family -- check out both following site. Highly recommended if, like me, you love everything Greek.
<p> Loved the interview, Jenn, and your answers gave me a good early morning laugh, Helen -- or should I say, Aphrodite! Checking out The Chocolate Affair now. Oh, and dragon fruit are my absolute fave fruit...good call!
<p> Ah the dragonfruit! Do you know I have to sneak up to the back fence to pick them. There are two large cranky dogs at the back and they hurl themselves at the fence every time I go near. I think the cactus is propping the fence up. I'm training it over the top and through a crack so that the thorns will cause them angst!
