<p> Come all you fellow travelling men of every rank and station And hear this short oration which as yet remains untold You might have been an Austrian, a German or a Bulgarian But sit ye sios-in-aice-liom, and the truth I will unfold You'll hear of great disunity unveiled to the community So take this opportunity of listening to me You'll hear of foreign nations and of youthful expectations And of a few relations in that beauty spot Glenlea
<p> I went to see the world's rage, being only sixteen years of age A steerage passage I engaged on a ship called the Iron Duke I went on board at Dublin's wall, being southward bound for the Transvaal I had a friend from Annascaul, and one from Donnybrook Our noble ship had scarcely steamed when in my mind sad memories gleamed I thought of my dear neighbours and their loving company I though about my brothers and our love for one another And of my grey haired mother there at home in Sweet Glenlea
<p> We landed safe but suddenly in that British spot Cape Colony In search of manual labour I travelled near and far I crossed the Orange River, among Hottentots and Kaffirs And I was made Grand Master on the Isle of Zanzibar A Dutchman high who admired me ways took me to see the Himalays And Boys o Boys was I amazed, their awful heights to see We wandered on through Hindustan, along the River Ganges And though it was a grand place, still the fairest was Glenlea
<p> This Dutchman suffered health's decline, he heard of cures in Palestine Persuaded me with him combine and along with him to go We landed safe at Jaffa and we journeyed to Jerusalem Thee ancient city of Hebron and the ruins of Jericho The surrounding mountains highest peaks, just like McGillicuddy's Reeks And from their summit you could see the Lake of Gallilee Likewise the River Jordan and the province of Samaria But though it sounds contrary - the fairest was Glenlea
<p> These doleful times soon drifted by till this faithful Dutchman friend and I Were forced to part and say goodbye, perhaps to meet no more I stood forlorn upon the quay as the ship that bore him sailed away His memory in my mind will stay till life's long days are o'er Still Providence had willed its way and therefore conscience must obey I went on board and sailed away when my friend did me forsake But often meditation made me turn for recreation And go home in contemplation to that beauty spot Glenlea
<p> In Palestine I made some coin, I heard of San Francisco's mine For to invest me capital I thought a good idee I landed safe in Frisco when the trees were blooming beautiful It was on that same evening that there was a great earthquake I was in my bed and sleeping sound, I woke to find things moving round But after that I heard no sound, no pain affected me And on the following morning when IOd recovered consciousness ?I wrote of all the consequence to my home in sweet Glenlea
<p> I told them in the letter how I lost the situation It was my earthly station and I wanted to go home And I hoped their generosity would aid my transportation And I went on relating how misfortune made me roam I got the cash to pay my way without disaster or delay And landed safe at Queenstown Quay, on board the Chimpanzee And after an excursion of some five long hours duration I reached the little station on the road to sweet Glenlea
<p> As we approached the terminus I viewed with consternation The awful congregation there assembled in the rain And I hoped some other personage of worldly estimation To heed their expectation was coming on by train As I scanned each individual's face, friends and neighbours, old time mates Assembled in their hundreds with a welcome home for me Oh they shouted with elation and they shook with great vibration The surrounding elevation on the road to sweet Glenlea
<p> And now I live contentedly among these friends and neighbours Endowed with all the favours of good fortune and delight And I've found among the multitude a charming little creature She's full of admiration, she's my lovely Irish wife And when we meet at Sunday's noon, at that cozy spot called top-of-Coom Where songs and stories would illume the hearts of you and me Among that grand old company of lovely friends and neighbours We're never tired of praising that beauty spot Glenlea.
