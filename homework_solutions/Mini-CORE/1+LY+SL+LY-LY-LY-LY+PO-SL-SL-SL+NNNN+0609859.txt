<p> Coming home again To see a girl thats prettier than a diamond shining in the sun Oh what fun! I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone I wonder if she's said to them as she said to me before
<p> However much you use me baby, come on use me more However much you use me baby, come on use me more
<p> Getting off the train To see a girl thats sweeter than an apple picked from Adam's tree Oh glory be! And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall And said to all those men as she said to me before
<p> However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more and more and more and more
<p> La-la-la, la la la la
<p> Arriving at the door Just to be told that the girl I'm missing has been in London for a while No more northern skies for her They say she's left a letter up the stair for everyone It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see and she says
<p> However much I love you, you will always love me more However much I love you, you will always love me more And I guess it's true However much she loves me I will always love her more
<p> La-la-la la la la la
<p> I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more and more and more...
