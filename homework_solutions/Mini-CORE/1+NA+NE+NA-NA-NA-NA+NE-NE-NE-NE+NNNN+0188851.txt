<h> Man on top of radio tower for six days receives frosty reception after climbing down
<p> A mentally disturbed man who has been perched on top of a TV tower for six days finally climbed down today - before being promptly arrested by police.
<p> William Sturdivant, 25, who had been on top of the 300-foot television tower in Tulsa since August 11, previously asked to have a Whataburger meal as well as some Oreos and milk delivered to him.
<p> He was shown climbing around the structure this morning after efforts to coax him down failed.
<p> Scroll down for video
<p> Perched: The 25-year-old man, named William, had been on top of the 150-foot TV pole since Thursday in a stand-off with police
<p> He is said to have hopped over a protective fence and scaled the Clear Channel radio tower on Thursday morning around 11am.
<p> While he is not believed to be suicidal, officials were concerned for his welfare after he had not eaten anything since Friday and until today had been refusing offers of food and drink, Fox News reported.
<p> A crowd of people gathered on the ground below him and a local restaurant is even said to have offered a 'Tower Guy' five-topping pizza yesterday to mark his fifth day.
<p> The guy is clearly mentally ill. Poor fella. Hope the restaurant that offered the pizza get boycotted. What a terrible thing to do to exploit this troubled young man. I hardly recognize the good people of the USA anymore.
<p> This is what they do in China...they put a giant safety net of some sort under them and hose the person off their perch. I hate to be insensitive but this man is tying up emergency services...enough games already. They have talked to him, they have reached out and it's now going on almost a week! Get him down, one way or another. I promise you, as soon as he saw a fire hose, he would come down voluntarily.
