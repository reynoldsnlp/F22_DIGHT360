<h> The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face lyrics
<h> Stereophonics The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face lyrics
<p> The first time ever I saw your face I thought the sun rose in your eyes And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave To the dark and endless sky [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/stere\\... ] The first time ever I kissed your mouth I felt the earth move in my hands Like the trembling heart of a captive bird That was there at my command, my love.
<p> And the first time ever I lay with you I felt your heart so close to mine And I knew our joy would fill the earth And last till the end of time
