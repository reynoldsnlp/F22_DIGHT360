<h> Book Description
<p> Why does it feel sometimes as if our children have special powers that enable them to tune us out completely? You ask your child to do her homework, get ready for school or bedtime. You think she heard you but . . . no response. You've tried everything -- time-outs, nagging, counting to three -- and nothing seems to work. In this invaluable book, Amy McCready, founder of the popular online parenting course Positive Parenting Solutions, presents a nag-and-scream-free program for compassionately yet effectively, correcting your children's bad behavior.
<p> McCready draws on Adlerian psychology and Positive Discipline, which focuses on the central idea that every human being has a basic need to feel connected and empowered -- children being no exception to the rule. According to McCready, when this need isn't met in positive ways, kids resort to negative methods. In this book she provides parents with a virtual toolbox of strategies they can use to give their children the attention and power they crave -- and do away with the misbehaving that adults dread.

<p> I have a 4-year-old toddler, who is pretty good and obedient most of the time, but I could not for the life of me get her to clean up her toys. I found myself raising my voice and using threats over this issue, so when I saw the title of this book, it immediately drew my attention. And after reading this book, I learned that it wasn't so much "what" I did but 'how" I did it. I would take away her toys as a logical consequence for not cleaning up (which the book supports) but until I read this book, I couldn't see why that consequence alone didn't work (this is just one example of what I learned).
<p> I've read several parenting books (The Happiest Toddler on the Block, 1-2-3 Magic, How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and LIsten So Kids Will Talk...). I learned a lot from those books, but If I Have to Tell You One More Time is hands-down the best. McCready shows you how to eliminate the root of the misbehaviors. I would call it a misbehavior prevention program where there are a lot of empowering of kids, training of kids, giving consequences (not punishments) to kids, etc... The book isn't overly stuffed with psychological babble, but instead has clear, direct instructions and examples of how parents should implement the tools. I also love how McCready empathizes with the parents and then empowers them. There were some things I didn't agree with and some things I wish McCready would have addressed like hitting, lying, stealing, etc. especially because she doesn't believe in "punishing" kids. But overall, it is an excellent book that every parent should read.
<p> And yes, parents, you actually have to parent. And it's hard (it's supposed to be!). It annoys the daylights out of me when parents blame their kids for the misbehaviors, (it's their personality, it's just a "phase" they're going through, they just won't listen, etc). So, if you're not willing to change, put in some hard work, or make your children your TOP priority, then this book isn't for you (or any parenting book for that matter).
<p> This book is for parents of toddlers to teenagers. If you have kids younger than 2, I would suggest reading The Happiest Toddler on the Block which gives great tools for disciplining those little ones. I would also recommend having your spouse and caregivers of your children read this book so everyone is on the same page.
<p> I pre-ordered this book because a friend of mine recommended Amy's parenting online training. I decided to read her book to see if the online training was something I would be interested in investing in. Well, I've already signed up! So worth it!
<p> I started reading the book when it arrived a couple of weeks ago, and literally had "a-ha" parenting insights throughout every chapter.
<p> I have 3 children all under the age of 7 and this summer has been a very trying/tiring parental challenge with boredom and lack of structure feeding into sibling fights, back talk, sleep struggles, general aggression, etc. But I feel invigorated now due to Amy's no-nonsense and clear instruction! I'm no longer counting down the days until school re-starts! As an example, all 3 went to bed last night without one single power struggle or wake-up!
<p> As a busy mom of two girls, this book is an absolute life-saver. It turns out many of my intuitive reactions to correct my kids' misbehaviors were actually making the problems worse - and this book draws on Adlerian Psychology principles to explain why.
<p> I love the author's approach to discipline - it's all about empowering your kids, not shaming or blaming them. McCready makes an important distinction between discipline and punishment - the word discipline comes from the root discipline, which means to teach or to train. That was just one of many "a ha" moments in this book. It seems so simple - but so many parents just punish their kids for misbehavior without teaching the child to actually make better choices in the future.
<p> Unlike the majority of parenting books out there, this one goes beyond just theory and advice, with an actual "toolbox" that arms parents with proven, effective, and respectful tools that REALLY work. I am so grateful to have this book- it's made a difference in the short term and I have no doubt the long-term impact on my girls will be even greater. I now know I'm raising them to be self-reliant, confident people who know how to make good choices.
