<p> Youre telling us that growth hacking is part of product AND marketing. I find it funny cause product IS marketing, its one of the four P that defines it. I think what youre trying to say is that the growth hacking marketer, because it is a marketer, is a specialist of both product management and place (distribution channel), and has the technical skills to work autonomously. It is true that this is not the kind of mix we see in the workplace, especially in large companies, but it still is marketing in the end; a new approach to organize marketing teams and new expectations for the marketers skill set.
