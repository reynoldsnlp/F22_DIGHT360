<p> I would love one of these if it wouldn't be cruel to keep it as a pet. They are beautiful. and yes my cats have climbed up my legs and onto my shoulders, all claws digging in to cling on. Damn painful but I love them anyway.

<p> One of our 'felines' regularly wraps himself round my ankle before clawing my leg - no-one else's leg .... just mine. I see that little Puma has the same determined look, though has slightly better weaponry.
