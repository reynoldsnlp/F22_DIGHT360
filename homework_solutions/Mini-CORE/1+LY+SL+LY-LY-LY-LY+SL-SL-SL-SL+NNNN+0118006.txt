<h> Nature Of The Experiment lyrics
<h> Tokyo Police Club Nature Of The Experiment lyrics
<p> We've got our tracks covered Thanks to your older brother It's not the moonlight that sets me off It's not the morning that makes me scoff
<p> It's my impeccable disorder Where I keep on falling for her It's not the way my mother talks It's not the people that she mocks
<p> It's the nature of the experiment It's the patterns of my temperament It's the nature of the experiment They're taking me in increments [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tokyo\\... ] We're halfway up the bracket The rain comes through my jacket It's not the stones inside my shoes It's not the risk of what's to lose
<p> It's an ancient Russian proverb But I doubt it's ones that you've heard It's not the cracks beneath the floor It's not the fact that it's a chore
<p> It's the nature of the experiment It's the patterns of my temperament It's the nature of the experiment They're taking me in increments
