<h> The 13 worst lines in movies, ever
<p> Compiling a worst of list is an almost impossible task. But Sarah's had a go, anyway...
<p> Entertainment Weekly recently published a list of what they considered to be the worst lines of dialogue in movies ever. They're pretty bad. But I've seen worse.
<p> The problem with making a worst-of list is that it's impossible to see all the dregs. Even considering the amount of low budget horror crap I watch, there's more out there. There's piles and piles of stuff I won't touch because I know it'll suck ( Norbit , anyone?) and those movies undoubtedly contain lines that just should not be uttered by anyone on Earth ever. Keeping up with the avalanche of straight-to-video shit in the world now isn't possible. So even this doesn't constitute a "worst" list. Just a "pretty fucking dreadful" list. Keeping all those caveats in mind, onto the list!
<p> 13. Serenity (2005) "I aim to misbehave."
<p> Even in the trailer, this line sounded awkward. In context, it sounded worse. How did Serenity manage to suck so much when Firefly was so utterly brilliant?
<p> 12. The Ring Two (2005) "I'm not your fucking Mommy!"
<p> Not improved by Naomi Watts' delivery.
<p> 11. Roman (2006) "What the shit you do, y'ain't got no TV?"
<p> A coworker eloquently expresses his shock at discovering that Roman doesn't own a television. In what almost sounds like one word. Boggling.
<p> 10. House of the Dead (2003) "We finally got to the boat, but it wasn't there!"
<p> Then clearly you didn't get to it, did you?
<p> 9. Doom (2005) "Semper fi, motherfucker!"
<p> "Always faithful, motherfucker"? Er. What?
<p> 8. Hellbreeder (2004) "Are you sure you saw what you think you thought you saw?"
<p> Er. Yes? No? What's the right answer here?
<p> 7. Jawbreaker (1999) "Some of the sweetest candies are sour as death inside."
<p> One of the worst police officers ever utters this nonsense in the middle of a discussion about a high school murder carried out using... a jawbreaker. This movie sucked. (Sucked -- like you suck candy? Get it? Okay, then.)
<p> 6. Pulse (2006) "Do you know what dying tastes like? Metal."
<p> Really? Okay.
<p> 5. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) "I hoped I'd get to nail you one more time. Didn't think it'd be literally."
<p> Where do you start with this movie? Urghhhhhh. There's nothing good about it, but this was particularly cringeworthy.
<p> EW's list has too many fairly good lines in amongst the bad ones. Plus, that "Sin City" quote fuckin' rocks.

<p> It doesn't seem fair to pick on movies where we have to rely on the translation being decent, but... I bet Battle Royale 2 had some right stinkers in it.
<p> Submitted by Matt on Wed, 2008-02-06 16:57.
<p> Whilst I assume this line lost some finesse in translation, I think the line from Battle Royale where a teenager is dying in her crush's arms deserves a mention here
<p> "I always thought...*cough*... that you...were so...cool"
<p> And dead.

<p> When you've reached into a pile of goo that used to be your best friends face, then you can tell me about fair.
<p> Submitted by RonHogan on Wed, 2008-02-06 17:41.
<p> Pretty much every line ever delivered by Hayden Christiansen is the worst line ever, regardless of the movie he's in.
<p> Submitted by SebPatrick on Wed, 2008-02-06 17:54.
<p> Fair play to EW on the X-Men one, though.
<p> Submitted by Spidergirl on Wed, 2008-02-06 18:19.
<p> RE: Storm, though, apparently that's mostly down to Halle Berry's dreadful delivery. It's supposed to be like [threateningly] "What happens to a toad when it gets hit by lightning?" and then, more flippantly, after he gets hit, "Oh. Same as everything else." Which is a much more Joss-Whedon-y line than how it actually ended up.
<p> Submitted by Spidergirl on Wed, 2008-02-06 18:41.
<p> I love all of those lines. :(
<p> Submitted by SebPatrick on Wed, 2008-02-06 18:32.
<p> Oh, also : every line spoken by both Arnie and Uma in Batman & Robin. Wait, no, make that every line spoken, full-stop, in Batman & Robin. In fact, I bet I could do a list of 13 lines from Batman & Robin that are worse than everything else on this list :
<p> Seb: You forgot "It's a cold town" and "Let's kick some ice", Arnie's two best lines!
<p> Submitted by ChristianLett on Wed, 2008-02-06 20:05.
<p> Poor list. For one, Serenity was a great film, on a par with Firefly, and "I aim to misbehave" is a great line. Your number one choice ("Nooooooo!") is merely your inner geek lashing out with disappointment with the Star Wars prequels as a whole (and what was Darth Vader supposed to do - the dance of joy?). Surely "They killed the younglings" from the same film is a million times worse! EW's list was better.
<p> P.S. This comment thing doesn't work in Firefox.
<p> Submitted by Spidergirl on Wed, 2008-02-06 20:38.
<p> Don't agree. At all. Serenity was a fucking disgrace. And I liked Revenge of the Sith, apart from that moment, which is inexcusable.
<p> Submitted by simonbrew on Wed, 2008-02-06 20:39.
<p> Aw, come on. Was there any line in recent history so out of place as the 'Noooooooooooooo'? The pivotal moment in a six film story arc, and it was greeted with howls of laughter. The wrong line, delivered in the wrong way, in an underwhelming film. It's my choice for first place, too.
<p> Submitted by Matt on Wed, 2008-02-06 21:18.
<p> I felt genuinely embaressed as an audience member during the "Noooooooo" moment.
<p> Submitted by twosheds on Wed, 2008-02-06 22:22.
<p> "Nooooooooooo"
<p> Billions of dollars and thirty years leading up to that line - and they blew it, despite having as many takes as they needed. Un-f***ing believable.
<p> Submitted by TVDust1 on Thu, 2008-02-07 16:12.
<p> I couldn't agree more about the 'Noooooo!' line, half of the dialogue of Attack Of The Clones could get into that list...
<p> Your list was far superior to EW's, I love that Jack Nicholson speech in As Good As It Gets. But then, I'm a soppy old sod.
<p> Submitted by Spidergirl on Wed, 2008-02-06 22:45.
<p> (Also "inner geek"? Nothing inner about it...)

<p> Sarah, your opinions on things take more wild turns than an autistic race-driver. Since when did Serenity become a 'disgrace'? Serenity was awesome. Not being as good as your favourite series does not make something bad.

<p> Tonight, we dine in hell. Spartaaaaaa
<p> Submitted by twosheds on Fri, 2008-02-08 04:40.
<p> I'm paraphrasing, but there was a line in ST:TNG that had me in stitches, and it went something like:
<p> Geordie: "We can uncouple the main phase routers and de-synch the dilithium crystals, but the transverse power channels are reading static phase whenever we try it."
<p> Ryker: "That doesn't make any sense."
<p> Submitted by Spidergirl on Fri, 2008-02-08 13:26.
<p> "Tonight, we dine in hell. Spartaaaaaa"
<p> YES. I tried to find something from 300, but I couldn't sit through the whole movie, so I missed it off the list. But it does sound like a hell of a lot of bad lines occur in that movie.
