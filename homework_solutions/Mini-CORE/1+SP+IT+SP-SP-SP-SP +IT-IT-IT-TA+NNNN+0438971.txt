<p> ...- "It is not for me to judge whether or not the industry can or cannot segregate for marketing purposes. The way that the Gene Technology Act has been formulated by agreement with all state and territory governments is that economic and trade impact issues are outside of the scope of this office."
<p> ...- Dr Meek ?As I said, Senator Heffernan, the issue of whether or not the crops can be segregated for marketing purposes is one that industry has to work out.
<p> ...- Dr Meek ?That is simply untrue. We look at three issues in relation to our risk assessment and risk management plan: toxicity and allergenicity is one of them; the second one is whether or not the genetically modified organism itself could be moved out of the site where it is grown; and the third one is whether the introduced gene could be moved into other plants. So there are three key areas.
<p> ...- Dr Meek ?It is my business. It is my business to assess whether or not that genetic modification has an adverse impact on human health and safety in the environment.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Only the narrow issue of that gene, not what that gene is for.
<p> Dr Meek ?Whether or not the modified plant behaves differently, for example, in the Australian
<p> environment to the non-genetically modified variety is certainly something we would take into account, but what we need to look at is whether the risks that are presented, if they are indeed presented by a genetically modified organism, can be managed.
<p> ...- Senator CHERRY ?Have you commissioned any research on impact on biodiversity in Australia of GM crops?
<p> Dr Meek ?No, we have not.
<p> ...- Senator CHERRY ?What research have you commissioned on the issue of human health effects of GM crops?
<p> Dr Meek ?Directly, we have not commissioned research. Obviously, Food Standards Australia New
<p> Zealand does a lot of work in assessing food products.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But they have commissioned no research either.
<p> Dr Meek ?I am not aware of what they have done, but there is obviously a great deal of data. All seven lines of the Bayer and the Monsanto oils from those canolas have been approved both nationally and internationally.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?And once that is done, you don?t investigate that further?
<p> Dr Meek ?We would look at any effects relating to toxicity and allergenicity related to the handling of the genetically modified organisms, but we would not reinvestigate food use.
<p> ...-
<p> Senator CHERRY ?You are not requiring any independent, totally arms-length assessments or
<p> considerations of issues like biodiversity or food safety.
<p> Dr Meek ?Food safety, I think we have already established, is outside of the remit. It is Food Standards Australia New Zealand.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?What does human health mean under your act then?
<p> Dr Meek ?It can be things to do with occupational health and safety issues, for example. As I said earlier, exposure to the crop: if the GM version of that crop is likely to, for some reason, be more allergenic than a non-GM, that is something we would look at. It is human health outside the food side of things.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Has the government set any policy guidelines for you in terms of your operation,
<p> other than what is in the intergovernmental agreement?
<p> Dr Meek ?No.
<p> Mr Slater ?Other than the policy principle?
<p> Dr Meek ?Sorry, I beg your pardon, yes.
<p> Mr Slater ?that has been set by the ministerial council that states we will be able to set GM-free zones and the regulator must take those into account in any decisions.
<p> Network Comment: The Hansard transcript for establishing the Gene Tech Act excluded economics as it was felt this was covered in assessment of "environment".
<p> Senate Estimates
<p> http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/com\\...
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?For 12 months I have been trying to get some sense out of the government on this issue and no-one has made any sense of it, even though it is a program that is progressing quite nicely in New Zealand. My other question goes to GM canola. You have all my condolences on having to deal with this issue. Do you think it is realistic for Australian farmers to be expected to segregate GM canola from non-GM canola? I know it is?
<p> Dr Meek ?Outside of my scope, yes. We have had this conversation before, as you rightly say. It is not for me to judge whether or not the industry can or cannot segregate for marketing purposes. The way that the Gene Technology Act has been formulated by agreement with all state and territory governments is that economic and trade impact issues are outside of the scope of this office.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?Do you think it is an incomplete and flawed strategy to do it that way? You can give something a tick-off and then there is this eternal argument with farmers who are faced with paying lawyers a river of gold for litigation on this issue of segregation.
<p> Dr Meek ?The issue of segregation goes well beyond gene technology.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?It certainly does.
<p> Dr Meek ?It is a matter that the agricultural industry deals with on a daily basis. The issue of the scope of the Gene Technology Act was considered very comprehensively in the formulation of the act. It was determined that the consideration of socioeconomic issues should be outside the scope of the act.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?I recognise why that is so. It is so that no vested interests get to influence?
<p> Dr Meek ?It was a concern expressed very strongly in the public consultation in relation to development of the act. It led to people expressing very strong views that they were concerned that the scientific independence and ability of interests to be taken into account in an economic sense could potentially be compromised. We really need an independent assessment of risk.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?I would like to put on the record, as a practical farmer, that the idea of being able to segregate it is rubbish. It is either all in or all out as far as I am concerned. I think Australian farmers are going to face serious problems in segregation. If anyone has had a crop with a few seeds of black oats in it, to see how the seed multiplies in the seed et cetera, it speaks for itself. Thank you very much, Mr Chair.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Following on from that question?and it is probably the key one in respect of your act?my reading of the act says there is no definition in the act of segregation as being an economic issue.
<p> Surely the question of whether the seeds propagate on a farm or the next farm is fundamentally an
<p> environmental issue. How do you justify the view that that is not an environmental issue?
<p> Dr Meek ?Because segregation is to do with segregation for marketing purposes. It is to have a separation of GM from non-GM.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But segregation is about ensuring that a neighbouring farm does not end up with a drift of seed or pollen from the farm next door. Surely that is an environmental issue.
<p> Dr Meek ?No. Segregation, as I said earlier, is about segregation for marketing purposes. In the risk
<p> assessment and risk management plan we have prepared in relation to each and every genetically modified organism which is proposed for release in Australia, we need certainly to look at the issue of whether or not the genetic material either in the plant itself or from the genes to other species can occur. What I must do is determine whether or not that movement presents a risk to human health and safety and the environment. That is the conclusion that I must come to in terms of, in the case of canola, for example, concluding that in fact there was no need for segregation because there were no risks that were greater than conventional canola from a human health and safety and environmental perspective.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But if there is a pollen shift, the studies here and overseas?in fact the more recent studies overseas probably more so than the studies here?show that there is a transfer of some canolas from one farm to another. That affects that farm environment. What I want to get to the bottom of is: where does your definition of the environment come from?
<p> Dr Meek ?I will just respond to the earlier point you made. Yes, indeed, there may be transfer of pollen and genetic material does flow in that context. We have done an exhaustive examination of the extent to which we think that will occur and it is to an extraordinarily low level. It drops off very sharply away from the crop itself. But the movement of pollen in and of itself does not represent a risk. What I need to look at it is whether or not any risk presented can be managed. It is very clear from the study we have performed that the movement of pollen transfer, as I said, is limited and, even if it did occur, it can be managed by existing agricultural practices.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?With great respect, if you think that there is a probability of segregating GM
<p> canola from non-GM canola and it building up in the seed base, I am afraid you have not been on a farm.
<p> Dr Meek ?I have already pointed out to you I am not talking about segregation here.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?No, but this is tied up with the environmental side of it because, as you know, birds will come along, pick a few seeds, fly to the nearest powerline and drop their message in the paddock next door and that is how it spreads and that is how the direct cousin of canola?the wild radish?spreads.
<p> Dr Meek ?We have looked at the probabilities of that occurring in great detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. We have concluded that the likelihood of that occurring is relatively low and?
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?I will take you for a run around the Riverina and show you under the powerlines where it occurs. You are presenting farmers with a nightmare.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?How can you say that, when the European Environment Agency said the risk of
<p> transfer to weedy relatives is quite high in canola? I have studied, as you can see, the various British studies which seem to completely cut across your entire analysis. Already I think your analysis is completely dated.
<p> Dr Meek ?The UK studies are a very good place to start in this context. The UK studies looked at the impact of herbicide management on a range of crops, both GM and non-GM. It says absolutely nothing about GM crops and their behaviour in the context of the environment. It is about herbicide resistance management.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But if the plant has been genetically modified to be herbicide resistant, then that
<p> fundamental change to its gene make-up obviously brings into play the issue of the management system around the use of the herbicide.
<p> Dr Meek ?Yes, as it does, indeed, for all of the other herbicide resistant management crops that are
<p> produced in the agricultural system by non-genetic means. The issue becomes one of herbicide resistance management and that is something that is an agriculturally wide issue. That is why, when we have come to look at the risks of gene transfer, in the context of GM canola, we have said that certainly it may occur, at an extraordinarily low level, as I stressed earlier.
<p> There are two issues to take into account: one is whether or not gene transfer occurs and then whether or not that transferred gene can actually become stable and integrate into subsequent populations. That is when an environmental issue arises. What we have concluded, after very thorough assessment, is that?and let us remember that a herbicide resistance gene only transfers resistance to one individual herbicide, it does not transfer resistance to all herbicides?there are multiple management practices that are available.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?In a paddock you could have Roundup resistant canola and, because of this
<p> resistance, you have to use a herbicide, but you could also have other plants which are susceptible to the herbicide?New Zealand chicory is a good example. I can show you a paddock of lucerne at home which had canola in it three years ago. It had weed in it for two years and I have sowed lucerne in it which is quite high now and all through the lucerne crop, because of what happened three years ago, are canola plants. I cannot deal with those canola plants because they are in the lucerne. What I am saying in practical terms, whether you believe it or no, is that you are presenting farmers with a bloody nightmare.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?The science review?and I want to come back to the timing of it in a second?warned expressly against the narrow consideration of purely the gene modification of crops and said it is necessary to judge the crop pesticide combination as a system rather than simply comparing the ecological impact of the crop in isolation.
<p> Dr Meek ?Yes, absolutely.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?I have read through your papers and it is purely about the toxicity of the plant itself.
<p> Dr Meek ?Absolutely not.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?It is not about the actual system.
<p> Dr Meek ?That is simply untrue. We look at three issues in relation to our risk assessment and risk
<p> management plan: toxicity and allergenicity is one of them; the second one is whether or not the genetically modified organism itself could be moved out of the site where it is grown; and the third one is whether the introduced gene could be moved into other plants. So there are three key areas.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But there is no consideration here anywhere of the issue of the crop herbicide
<p> management system.
<p> Dr Meek ?Thank you for raising that, because it is a very helpful illustration of the way in which we have decided in Australia to regulate the situation. As I have already pointed out, there are indeed a number of herbicide resistant crops which have been developed by non-genetically modified means. The whole issue, as you have just pointed out from your quote from the UK study, is about the combination of the herbicide crop situation. That crop may or may not be modified to be herbicide resistant through gene technology; it may be through other means. What we have in the situation in Australia is a very clear distinction, but a very close collaboration between two different regulatory systems. One is the Gene Technology Act, which looks at live and viable genetically modified organisms; the other is the Agricultural Pesticides and Veterinary Management Authority.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?But it should be all in one process.
<p> Dr Meek ?Which looks at the regulation of herbicides and their use as a whole.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Who has done a system analysis then?
<p> Dr Meek ?The Agricultural Pesticides and Veterinary Management Authority does a thorough appraisal of the environmental use of herbicides and we look at it from the point of view of the movement of genes. In that sense I think you will find, if you look at the work in relation to the movement of genes and the introduction of genes either into canola itself, or into related weedy species, that we have actually looked very closely at the capacity for that to happen.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?Can we have a forum in which both sides of that position?your position and whoever the other crowd are?get into one room?
<p> Dr Meek ?It used to be the NRA?
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?and we flog this out in one meeting. This is a nightmare. Do you understand the multiplication factor? What is the contamination factor they are debating will be allowed in Europe? Is it one per cent or two per cent?
<p> Dr Meek ?As I said, Senator Heffernan, the issue of whether or not the crops can be segregated for
<p> marketing purposes is one that industry has to work out.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?I understand all that, but the industry is not getting a fair shot at this. I do not have a position. My position is all in or all out. I do not give a rat?s whether it is all canola, all GM or all non- GM, or all in together. But you will not be able to separate it because the multiplication factor of the contamination in the seed base cannot be handled. It is physically impossible. Once you get one per cent of seed contamination of seed base, the next year it is five per cent, the next year it is 15 per cent.
<p> CHAIR ?Senator Heffernan, I have allocated this time to Senator Cherry and I think you should leave him to ask some questions in his half hour.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Coming back to the issue of the UK crop studies and that fundamental finding in
<p> terms of the GM rape seed, the amount of weed matter is reduced by 80 or 90 per cent with flow-on effects for bees, birds, insects, butterflies, the whole works. You are saying that is irrelevant to any of your considerations because that is a matter for the pesticide management authority.
<p> Dr Meek ?As you recall, there is a comparison between the GM and the non-GM price of three different crops and you have picked one of them, canola. There are differences in weed levels and also biodiversity.
<p> There are two reasons why this is not a direct consideration of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator.
<p> One of them I have already touched on, which is that the study itself makes clear the analysis was on the impact of different herbicide regimes. The other issue in the context of the findings of this study for Australia is that these findings have very little relevance directly to the Australian situation. The reason for that is that the weeds in the UK agricultural system essentially are remnant native vegetation and the native flora and fauna are heavily reliant on those weeds, which is why an effective removal of weeds from a crop in the UK situation can have a very adverse effect on the local environment. In fact the UK system relies on biodiversity in the field for its flora and fauna to survive and thrive.
<p> The situation in Australia is extraordinarily different. Weeds in the Australian context are usually introduced exotic species, so our native flora and fauna are not adapted to survive on them and nor do they need them for their survival because, indeed, our agricultural system does not dominate the environment to the extent that it does in the UK. We have very large areas of biodiversity outside.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But roadsides and riparian zones are obviously very important in terms of vegetation and native species in this country and there is certainly concern raised in several studies even here about the prospect of crop spray drift into those areas or even the pollen coming across from a nearby farm.
<p> Dr Meek ?You have touched on two different areas there. Certainly herbicide spray, as I said to you before, is a fundamental consideration in this study, but whilst I agree the edges of fields can be an important area, they are by no means fundamental to the survival of flora and fauna in Australia as they are in the UK.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Can you take me through very quickly the arrangements you have with the APVMA to deal with the system issues like the issue of spread.
<p> Dr Meek ?The Gene Technology Act in the way it is structured is very closely controlled to ensure that there is a seamless relationship between the work that the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator has to do in terms of assessing risks to human health and safety and the environment from GMOs. The other regulatory agencies, such as Mr Slater has already mentioned, are the Therapeutic Goods Administration and Food Standards Australia New Zealand. The Agricultural Pesticides and Veterinary Management Authority is one of the prescribed agencies in the legislation with whom we liaise when we conduct risk assessment and risk management studies for intentional releases to the environment.
<p> We have a very close working relationship with the APVMA to ensure we exchange relevant information.
<p> Parallel assessments are often the case. As you may be aware, the approval for the use of a herbicide on a herbicide tolerant GM crop requires approval both from the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator and the APVMA.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Could you take on notice, if you take both the Bayer and the Monsanto applications, the interactions which you have had with the APVMA in terms of dealing with the issue of the crop management system. I have great difficulty accepting your premise that if a plant is being genetically modified to be resistant to a herbicide that that is not your business.
<p> Dr Meek ?It is my business. It is my business to assess whether or not that genetic modification has an adverse impact on human health and safety in the environment.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Only the narrow issue of that gene, not what that gene is for.
<p> Dr Meek ?Whether or not the modified plant behaves differently, for example, in the Australian
<p> environment to the non-genetically modified variety is certainly something we would take into account, but what we need to look at is whether the risks that are presented, if they are indeed presented by a genetically modified organism, can be managed. In certain instances that management strategy may lie in the area of responsibility that I have, but in the context of whether the management involves use of a herbicide then, in fact, it would become the joint responsibility of both me and the APVMA.
<p> CHAIR ?Can I butt in here? It appears that the committee do not require FSANZ, as we first thought.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?Are they the people who talk about human genes in cows?
<p> Ms Halton ?They are the people who talk about foodstuffs.
<p> Senator HEFFERNAN ?There is no need to do it in this forum, but I would like to have a long discussion because I have not been able to get any sense out of anyone in the government on this issue.
<p> Ms Halton ?I am sure our scientific experts can do a bit of research, so they can perhaps assist you.
<p> CHAIR ?That sounds good. Senator Cherry, please proceed.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Coming back to the issue of the environment, are you operating under any policy
<p> instructions from government as to what is and is not the environment for the purposes of this act?
<p> Dr Meek ?No, the definition of the environment that we use is the one that is in the Gene Technology Act.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But that does not exclude the notion of a neighbouring farm environment, for
<p> example?
<p> Dr Meek ?It would only include a neighbouring farm environment in the context of whether or not there was a risk to human health and safety in the environment. If the risk to the farm was an economic one then it would be outside of the definition of the environment.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?But if a farmer is of the view that contamination of their crop with a GM crop
<p> changes their farm ecosystem, then is that not an environmental issue rather than an economic one? You are saying it is an economic one but the farmer may regard that as an environmental one.
<p> Dr Meek ?What the farmer may regard his farm situation to be and what I have to look at, which is the environment as a whole, may be two different things. It is very often the case that a farmer may well regard it as an impact but it is actually about the marketability of the crop they are growing on their particular paddock.
<p> When it comes down to something that is an economic impact then that is quite clearly outside the scope of this estimates that I am required to conduct.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Your web site says you take into regard international developments in your
<p> assessments. Given the imminence of the UK crop trials and also the UK science panel report, why was the Bayer application not delayed until those reports were received and assessed?
<p> Dr Meek ?Because the UK farm trials were exactly that. They were farm trials and we were considering a commercial release application. I have already explained in considerable detail why the findings of the UK farm trials have very little direct relevance to Australia because our environmental situations are so completely different.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Have you commissioned any research on impact on biodiversity in Australia of GM crops?
<p> Dr Meek ?No, we have not.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Are you aware of any peer review studies in Australia that have examined the impact of GM canola and the associated herbicide regime on Australian biodiversity?
<p> Dr Meek ?We have looked at some 400 papers in the risk assessment and risk management plan. I would suspect that amongst those there may well have been.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?You can take that on notice if you like. I would be interested in the extent to which your office has looked at that issue.
<p> Dr Meek ?As I said earlier, if it is to do with a herbicide resistance management issue then that falls firmly within the jurisdiction of the APVMA. If that is the area you are interested in then I suspect you should be directing your question to them.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?So all the pesticide questions go to them. Do you have any regard for Landcare and the work that they have done trying to protect native species in agricultural ecosystems at all?
<p> Dr Meek ?When we start work on a risk assessment/risk management plan, we prepare a consultation version of that risk assessment/risk management plan, with advice from a whole range of expert groups and authorities, including the APVMA. Once we have put that together, we actually put it out for public consultation, so if there are any groups, such as Landcare groups or whatever, that had comment in the context of a specific application, then we would certainly be very pleased to hear anything that they had to say in relation to human health and safety or the environment, and risks that might present to them.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?In terms of the field trials which were conducted on GM canola under the auspices of your act, was there any consideration of the biodiversity in the field and on the field margins? Is there any interesting research which you have come across from your field trials?
<p> Dr Meek ?Field trials, by definition, are undertaken under limited crop control conditions. They are
<p> required to have a pollen buffer of conventional canola around them, and then there are isolation and
<p> monitoring zones outside of that, which require the removal of related brassicaceous species. There is no research on biodiversity because what we are actually looking at is quite controlled in the sense that we are trying to keep away any genetically compatible plants in the context of the limit and control trials.
<p> Senator CHERRY ?Do you think there should be research on biodiversity as part of an approval process?
<p> Dr Meek ?I think the issue is that we have to look at risk to human health and safety in the environment.
<p> Biodiversity is one area which we look at closely in the context of, for example, insecticidal GM crops but, again, there is an issue there, a close interaction between us and the APVMA, and in that context things like insect resistant management strategies which are to do with preserving the reproductive capacity of the insects that are impacted upon in the context of those GMOs are something that is run through the APVMA.
