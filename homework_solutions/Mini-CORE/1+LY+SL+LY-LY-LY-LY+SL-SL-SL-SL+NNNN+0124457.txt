<h> Future Is In The Future Lyrics - Electric Six
<p> If money talks then I'm a mime If time is money then I'm out of time And I was once with a million quid Have a seat I'll tell you what I did
<p> Can't sit down 'cause I'm a dancer And you know that I'm the answer Die slow, die fast now 'Cause it's never gonna last now
<p> We'll karaoke all night long We'll Macarena till the break of dawn We'll travel round till the morning light All night, all night, all night, all night
<p> Baby, you've got to signal before you turn I think you're headed for the disco burn 'Cause the future is in the future And the past is a big brick wall You know I need to make you understand, now I'm a man not a disco ball
