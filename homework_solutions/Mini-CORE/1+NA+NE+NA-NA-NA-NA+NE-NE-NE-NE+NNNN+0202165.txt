<p> JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, standing next to the U.S. defense chief, said Wednesday without qualification that international economic sanctions have had no effect on Iran's nuclear program and suggested Israeli patience was wearing thin, a statement that amounted to an indictment of President Barack Obama's policy toward the Islamic republic.
<p> Netanyahu dismissed U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's assurances that the United States shared its goal of a non-nuclear Iran, saying the central features of Washington's strategy for stopping the Islamic republic's nuclear ambitions -- sanctions and diplomacy -- were perilously close to failure.
<p> Netanyahu did not explicitly threaten to attack Iran, but that was the unspoken implication of his assertion that all non-military measures have proven ineffective in persuading Iran to change its course.
<p> "Right now the Iranian regime believes that the international community does not have the will to stop its nuclear program," Netanyahu said. "This must change, and it must change quickly because time to resolve this issue peacefully is running out."
<p> His message was particularly striking, given that he delivered it beside Panetta, who spent two days in Israel offering reassurances that the two allies shared the same goals on Iran.
<p> "I want to reassert again the position of the United States that with regards to Iran, we will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. Period," the Pentagon chief said. "We will not allow them to develop a nuclear weapon. And we will exert all options in the effort to ensure that that does not happen."
<p> Panetta argued that all non-military means of pressuring Iran must first be exhausted before military action is called for. He said repeatedly that Washington still considers military action an option for the future.
<p> But Netanyahu was unyielding in his view that more must be done now. He said sanctions have hurt Iran's economy but not achieved their ultimate purpose, which is to change the calculus of Iran's rulers.
<p> "America and Israel have also made clear that all options are on the table. You yourself said a few months ago that when all else fails, America will act," he said, referring to statements by Panetta. "But these declarations have also not yet convinced the Iranians to stop their program."
<p> Iran asserts that its nuclear program is meant to produce civilian energy, not to make weapons. And it insists that it has a right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to enrich the uranium that can be used either to power civilian nuclear reactors or to build bombs.
<p> Panetta's visit came on the heels of a stop here by Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who has accused the Obama administration of doing too little to help Israel and too little to stop Iran.
<p> In his joint appearance with Panetta at an air defense site in southern Israel, Defense Minister Ehud Barak sought to emphasize solidarity with the Obama administration, crediting Panetta and Obama for the "extraordinary" strength of the U.S.-Israeli defense relationship.
<p> But he, like Netanyahu, parted ways with Washington by expressing doubts about the viability of the sanctions strategy.
<p> Standing beside Panetta and flanked by American and Israeli flags, Barak said he sees an "extremely low" probability that international economic sanctions will cause the Iranian leaders to give up their nuclear ambitions.
<p> "We have clearly something to lose" while the world waits for sanctions to have the desired effect, "because the Iranians are moving forward," Barak said.
<p> Netanyahu's and Barak's statements, taken together, dramatized the growing strain in U.S.-Israeli relations.
<p> The Obama administration has steadily ratcheted up the severity of economic sanctions on Iran, and on Monday Congress agreed on a new package of sanctions that expand financial penalties and further target Tehran's energy and shipping sectors. Iran angrily equated the moves to economic "warfare."
<p> Some argue that tough economic sanctions are a blunt instrument of power that harms a wide swath of ordinary Iranians without punishing those whose political decisions are the target of the penalties.
<p> The National Iranian American Council, which seeks to promote better relations between the two countries, denounced the latest sanctions.
<p> "The bill imposes collective punishment on the Iranian people by seeking to destroy the Iranian economy," said the council's policy director, Jamal Abdi. "Meanwhile, Iranian regime officials do not suffer from lack of food or medicine and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps enjoys an increasing share of economic power under a sanctions economy."
<p> Panetta highlighted a series of measures the Obama administration has taken recently to improve Israel's defenses. He noted that the U.S. has invested more than $200 million in an air defense system known as Iron Dome, which is designed to shoot down short-range rockets, mortars and artillery shells fired into northern Israel from southern Lebanon and into Israel's south from the Gaza Strip. An Iron Dome launcher formed the backdrop to Panetta's news conference with Barak near the city of Ashkelon, five miles north of Gaza.
<p> Panetta also said the administration is working with the builder of the Air Force's next-generation F-35 fighter to include a special package of enhancements on the version that Israel intends to purchase.

<p> The American people were lied too over and over again to justify attacking Iraq (I believe Israels intelligence) ....now they are lying to us about attacking Iran...lets see the proof...or screw Israel! AND Israel has nukes...lets rid those while we are at it...

<p> I dont think Iranians is capable of invading Israeli after seeing what iranians could do in the Iran-Iraq war of 1980's... Iranian soliders were running naked screaming "Allah" or something out in the open swamps to be blown away by Iraq's artillery... Iran had built up military capabilities somewhat since then but Iran cannot transport soldiers to Israeli or roll up a convoy of tanks toward Isreali by any means.. Iraq and Jordan wont allow this. So Israeli can safely bomb Iran's economic lines for the time being to keep Iran from paying its bills on time... I dont see how iran can leave its boundary lines and be a threat by any means.. can it?
<p> "I dont think Iranians is capable of invading Israeli after seeing what iranians could do in the Iran-Iraq war of 1980's" this is why they are building nuclear bomb. They are not planning to invade Israel, they are planning to nuke it.

<p> OK - as an Israeli I can now breathe easy - of course there is the problem of the hundreds of missiles they and 60,000. missles with Hezbollah - the satelite of Iran. Iraq is nothing any more and I doubt very much the US will return. Jordan even less. Using their Nuclear umbrella. But they could instead hit the oil rich Sunni states and bring America to its kness.

<p> If Romney is President now and running for reelection next NOvember , would he bomb iran today? I dont think so.. He would wait unilt after election day.. No President wants to start a war before the election day.. Netanyahu knows better than that.. Israeli could have bombed Iran for any reason long before this .. Who cares about any Jew hating nation.. just bomb Iran anywhere . Why wait till iran is close to an atom bomb before start acting up like that... Iran always said that it wants to erase Israeli off the map for decades yet Israeli did nothing.. until now.. Even if Iran pass the day of no return on its nuclear capability before the election day, this should not mean that we have to act now .. it is political suicide for any party to help Israeli stop iran 's nuclear progress befroe the election day.. I will never understand why England put Israeli on that part of map after WWII without giving any concerns to the Arabs around Israeli.. Did the Palestine welcome Israeli with open arms?? No,, Israeli went to war with Arabs right after the ink dry on the map.. then again , again again .. I can understand the biblical arguments around Jersusalem and stuff, but the Arabs are never happy since the beginning of the times.. (cont'd)

<p> Do we actuallly have obligations to Israeli for helping them move there for certain strategic objectives? If so,, say so.. Should we fail to bomb Iran's nuclear targets before election mean that Obama should pay the price himself while Netanyahu gets away scotfree??? See what I am trying to say? I would gladly support Netanyahu's immediate concerns which may be accurate enough to warrant immediate action against iran before it is too late . This is a serous concern .. I dont think that Obama should be held liable for any failure whatsoever!!! Israeli is an critical ally of America and our voters should be fair to Obama for taking whatever necessary actions based on factual advice by our military forces be it a failure or a success. American voters simply cannot fairly single Obama out for whatever the outcome before the election day.. if Netanyahu is actually right about the grave concern and the immediate action necessary to undertake as soon as possible, I would not quarrel with Netanyahu despite his political bent.. it is the American voters that must vote fairly on which President is better for the next four year term

<p> Panetta can tell Netanyahu to go ahead and bomb Iran as long as we dont provide any support until after elections... If Romney wins, it is his headache not Obama.. If Obama wins, we will help Israeli after the election day. Fair enough, Netanyahu? I understand you perfectly well, Netanyahu! I have nothing agaisnt you, Netanyahu but it is just poor timing .... Remember Jimmy Carter's helicopter rescue effort for the hostages in Iran that ended in embrassing failure strangely enough as it was! Israeli warplanes can go ahead and strafing all the oil tankers exiting iran for the time being .. or ports to keep iran fromearning any necesary incomes until election day. Go ahead , Israeli.. You have a reasonable case against Iran's nuclear ambition.. It is only 90 days till electin day.

<p> Israel is a successful state in the same way that Al Capone was a successful businessman. The only difference is that Al Capone was caught for the crime of evading paying tax dollars, while Israel uses our tax dollars to commit its crimes.

<p> It is embarrasing that the entire governing class in the US, with very few exceptions, has to kowtow to an ethnocentric and paranoid regime, which thrives on chaos, criminality, belligerence, threats, and the undeserved largesse of the already heavily burdened American taxpayers. The "special relationship" is a one sided, abusive one which is putting American interests on a collision course with our own government's policies. It must be ended- it will be ended, hopefully not too late. The world owes nothing to Israel. Despite what our captive MSM would have us believe, the earth does not revolve around deference to their sensibilities, nor are the nations of the world in any way obligated to sacrifice the interests of the vast majority of their peoples to satisfy these squalling, whining geopolitical brats.

<p> I hope israel flattens that plant. When they do..then iran and all those idiot nations who want Israel dead will scream in the streets how they must be killed and declare holy war this and that against them...and compeltely forget THEY have all said Israel must die prior to this "attack" which is really simply self defense. It is ridiculous.
<p> Golden calf? I understand israel is a strategic friend of the USA's in the region. Just like SA. Are they a perfect friend? No. Just like SA. Iran's leadership has said out right, that they will burn the scourge of israel from the face of the planet in a holy fire...and this just as they started their quest for nuclear "power'....and built 250 centrifuges...one has to be blind to miss the obvious implications...

<p> spending Billions and Billions on defense and beefing up weaponry that can not buy a peace treaty. sound like the politicians minds must be set to win and only through war and devastation.

<p> And in the event of success Obama could make victory speech and take credit in upcoming elections that he singlehandedly is responsible for disarming nuclear Iran, in the event of failure though he could alienate himself and condemn Israeli action.

<p> Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has once again called for the annihilation of Israel, which he labeled "the axis of unity of the world hegemonic powers."
<p> Speaking in advance of International Qods Day, set this year for August 17, Ahmadinejad repeated his annual litany of hate for the Jewish State in a meeting with ambassadors and embassy personnel of Islamic nations in Tehran, according to the official state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), quoting from a statement posted on the website of his presidential office
