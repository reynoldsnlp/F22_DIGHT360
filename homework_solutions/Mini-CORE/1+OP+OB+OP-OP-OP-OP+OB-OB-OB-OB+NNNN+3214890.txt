<h> "True Believers" are a serious problem in this country
<p> "True Believers" are a serious problem in this country.  The American public is beset by a plethora of irrational delusions that are widely believed.
<p> "True Believers" cling to their delusional paradigms with the same obsession that Silas Marner clung to his gold, all the while denying the validity of any other viewpoint.
<p> Both religion and science suffer from the same narrow-minded belligerence.
<p> For example, consider this comparison test of scientific thinking skills between separate groups of Ph.D. scientists and Protestant Ministers.
<p> They were advised that "science" had already determined the "four correct" (there were actually more than four) solutions to a given problem.   Both groups were given ample time to construct rules governing the behavior of certain variables.
<p> 1. The Ministers conducted three times as many experiments before they offered an answer.
<p> 2. The ministers were only half as likely to return an answer that had already been disproved.
<p> 3. The ministers were three times slower in venturing to offer their first hypothesis.
<p> 4. The ministers found twice as many acceptable solutions to the problem as the scientists.
<p> In other words, the Ministers were more "scientific" in their thinking than the Ph.D. scientists.
<p> It seems the scientists were indoctrinated with their own brand of dogma in their own "religion" and the ministers were liberated from their usual intellectual orthodoxy by being thrown into an unfamiliar arena.
<p> Would you want to bet that if the subject had been theology the scientists would have been more creative in their thinking than most clergy?

<p> "Though defensive violence will always be 'a sad necessity' in the eyes of men of principle, it would be still more unfortunate if wrongdoers should dominate just men." - St. Augustine
<p> "A new idea is first condemned as ridiculous, and then dismissed as trivial, until finally it becomes what everybody knows." -
<p> William James
<p> "This is the real task before us: to reassert our commitment as a nation to a law higher than our own, to renew our spiritual strength. Only by building a wall of such spiritual resolve can we, as a free people, hope to protect our own heritage and make it someday the birthright of all men." -- Ronald Reagan
<p> A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government." -- Edward Abbey
<p> "War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war, is worse. A man who has nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance at being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself." John Stuart Mill
<p> "A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government." ~~~George Washington
<p> "I'd rather entrust the government of the United States to the first 400 people listed in the Boston telephone directory than to the faculty of Harvard University." William F. Buckley, Jr.
<p> "Conservatives are enemies of the government. Liberals are enemies of the nation because they are not enemies of the government." Aristotle the Hun
<p> "If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?" Albert Einstein
<p> "Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass...it's about learning how to dance in the rain." ANON
<p> "That government is best which governs least." Thomas Paine
<p> "A nation that substitutes emotion and empathy for rational thought will eventually digress into the Dark Ages," Congressman Steve King (R-IA),
<p> INTEGRITY: The highest courage is to dare to be ourself in the face of adversity. Choosing ethics over convenience and truth over popularity means there is never a wrong time to do the right thing.
<p> Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.
<p> The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.
<p> They may be more likely to go to Heaven for good intentions yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.~ C. S. Lewis
