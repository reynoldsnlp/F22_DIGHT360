<h> I'd Have To Be Crazy Lyrics
<h> Willie Nelson
<p> I'd have to be crazy To stop all my singing And never play music again You'd call me a fool If I grabbed up a top hat And ran out to flag down the wind And I'd have to be weird To grow me a beard Just to see what the rednecks would do But I'd have to be crazy Plumb out of my mind To fall out of love with you Now I know I've done weird things I told people I heard things When silence was all that abounds Been days when it pleased me To be on my knees Following ants, as they crawled across the ground I've been insane on a train But I'm still me again The place where I hold you is true So I know I'm alright 'Cause I'd have to be crazy To fall out of love with you No I don't wanna intend to But should there come a day When I say that I don't love you You probably waited I sure would be dingy To live in an envelope Waiting alone for a stamp You'd swear I was loco If I rubbed for a genie While burning my hand on the lamp And I may not be normal But nobody is So I'd like to say 'fore I'm through I'd have to be crazy Plumb out of my mind To fall out of love with you I'd have to be crazy Plumb out of my mind To fall out of love with you
