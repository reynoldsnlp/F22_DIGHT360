<h> Australia pledges $20 million towards video & computer games
<p> The Gillard Government will spend 20-million dollars to drive innovation in video and computer gaming.
<p> Software developers will be supported by the government through grants from a newly created Interactive Games Fund.
<p> Minister for Arts Simon Crean told Neil Mitchell a wide range of platforms will be supported by the grants.
<p> "This is just a natural extension of the film industry.  Australians consume over $1.5 billion dollars worth of games each year and the global economy for these games is expected to be $90 billion by 2015," Mr. Crean said.
<p> "This is about nurturing our young Australian talent and start-up companies.  This is what this fund will do."
<p> NEIL MITCHELL: These are the questions I believe Julia Gillard needs to answer. They have come up mostly through The Australian newspaper and other information that has come out from her former law firm Slater & Gordon.
<p> NEIL MITCHELL: Something strange seems to be happening in our school yards: tension. So extreme that there is going to be a code of conduct for parents - not kids -- to stop them belting each other, arguing or bullying kids.

<p> This is the way of the future and we need to support our local businesses and create jobs for our kids, so that they can compete on the world stage.

<p> What is everybody complaining about? This move may create jobs and help an industry.
<p> I bet if this money was being invested in our Olympic Athletes nobody would bat an eyelid. Where's the benefit from those tax dollars go? A couple of weeks entertainment every few years for moronic sports fans.

<p> She is promising spend that doesn't exist! The govt is broke! What they now need is a treasurer to hit the print button to get more cash! Simply irresponsible!
<p> How is this being funded? Friday 16 November, 2012 - 6:05 AM
<p> That's good news for my computer savvy gaming son if thats the way the world is turning teenagers need all the correct pathways for the future in these uncertain times.

<p> You have got to be joking, with our health services in crisis and money needed on so many other projects, this woman is a total fool, and hurry up and bring on an election.

<p> This is the first and only thing this poor excuse for a PM has ever done that would help an industry instead of destroy it. The gaming industry is as big if not bigger than the movie industry, and Australian programmers are some of the best in the world.
