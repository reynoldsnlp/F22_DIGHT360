<h> Ever Wanted To Rename Two Sisters?
<p> You are bidding on the right to legally choose our middle names. We are Lynda and Katy from wellington and werent given middle names at birth.
<p> We will supply you with proof of the name change and use it in our daily lives!
<p> All money will be donated to our dearest friend Molly Frank 18 years from Paraparaumu who has had a long battle against an aggressive cancer called Rabdomyosarcoma.. This led her down a 42 week journey of intense chemo and radiation therapy. She finally finished her treatment in July this year. Molly was in remission for 3 months she started walking again grew her hair back became a normal teenage girl. We have unfortunately found out the cancer has returned and is too close to her heart to be removed. She would like a trip with her family down to the south island in a caravan as she was born there.
<p> You can find her journey of facebook search " Mollys journey" where you can also make donations or enter raffles etc.
<p> Cost of name change is about $127 and $30 approx to get new birth certificate, this will be taken from the total and the rest will go directly to Molly Frank.
<p> We reserve the right to refuse any rude or offensive names (please approve any names before bidding if your unsure) Also remember there is two of us! Get creative its all for a good cause! Thank you all
<p> If one is gold and the other is digger sure, if you would like both to be "gold digger" we find this offensive because we aren't keeping any of this money for ourselves. If you read the description it's for a really good cause. Thanks 12:09 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> What an awesome pair of friends you are!! I hope Molly gets her dream trip and has a wonderful time. I love the suggestion above using both of Molly's names. Good luck with your fund raising. j*****u (62 )  12:04 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> I just love this; what amazing friends you are. Does Molly have any nicknames that would be appropriate? I would suggest that you ring your local radio station about this auction too :) l******2 (618 )  12:23 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> People call her Moll Moll if that helps haha. We have emailed a few radio stations trying to get a bitmofmhelp help to promote! Thanks :) 12:30 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Well Moll for you and Moll for your friend it is then! (PS: Trader stacies5 should be ashamed of themselves; "Gold Digger" indeed. It is very clear that you are doing this for your friend, not for yourselves!). If you have no luck with your local radio stations, definitely contact Simon (Si & Gary, morning radio announcers) on More FM in Christchurch, he would love this story :) l******2 (618 )  12:42 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Thank you for your support, I agree with your comment but there will always be someone trying to turn something positive into a negative. Thank you very much for your support :) 12:47 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> What an amazing cause - And such a gorgeous girl she is, F__ Cancer indeed! Best of luck on the auction, if I weren't so darn broke I'd bid as much as I could for such a sweet idea. I'm awful with naming though - Would need to bounce around idea first :P Best of luck, sending my love to dear Molly &lt;3 :) a***********e (52 )  1:45 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Yes if we had more money we would do the same. She deserves the world. Thank you for your support :) 1:47 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> you girls are so adorable, so cute, so sweet, i will bid 2,000 if i did not bank up :) s***3 (3 )  2:10 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Thank you so much :) spread the word :) 2:14 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> aren't you lovely girls! You should be modelling. Hopefully this will launch a cool career for you two girls and help your friend. xx c****s (1179 )  2:14 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Aw that's very sweet of you. If we can help her we will be more than happy :) 2:17 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> You can follow her journey on Facebook under "Molly's journey" where there is also a bank account number where even $1 helps :). I would post the account number on here but I'm unsure if its against trade me terms. Thanks :) 2:27 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Hi, what an awesome cause, you girls should be so proud of yourselves.(just an idea) do you girls have an bank account number that money can be donated into, not everyone can afford to bid, but some can make small donations into an account, have seen it done on alot of other charity auctions :) a**********e (378 )  2:37 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> http://www.facebook.com/Mollys Journey?ref=ts&fref=ts there is an account number on there, don't want to post the number on here incase it's against trade me terms and conditions :) thanks 2:44 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Sorry I am unable to bid BUT there has to be people living in the South Island reading this auction who maybe be able able to pull some strings and help/donate in some small way towards the trip for Molly ie accomodation, fuel vouchers, sight-seeing tours etc. Come on people, please help make this happen. Good luck for the future, you two and all the best for Molly and her family. p********t (56 )  2:47 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Yes hopefully we get some coverage on this so maybe people who can help in other ways can see :) thanks for your support :) 2:50 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> If you are the winner there would be fine :) thanks 5:01 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Hi Lynda & Katy, I live in Paraparaumu & have a local radio host interested in talking to you and hopefully raising the profile of your auction. Have left a post on the Molly's Journey facebook page asking for your contact details. Please have a look and send me a message via facebook so I can put you in touch. k****1 (10 )  3:48 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Are there any names you two would prefer? I'm sure that the winning bidder would be just as happy to see you two with names you want & like and would be just as happy donating to a great cause. :) k**********2 (44 )  4:56 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Molly has said she thinks Molly and frank would be cool, at the end of the day it's the bidders choice ;) 5:05 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Just wanted to say good luck with your auction & all the very best for your friend in getting her wish. You two are lovely friends (& yes, the three of you are very beautiful!) oh & I especially love one name (Lynda hehe). xxxxx p***1 (257 )  4:58 pm, Fri 16 Nov

<p> I'd like her too and I'm sure she would love that. Maybe you will win so that happens ;) thanks 5:43 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Hey girls, you are such amazing friends! I also have been fighting Sarcoma. I was 26yrs when diagnosed with Ewings/Undifferentiated Sarcoma - they gave me 6 mths to live as was unoperable. After a year long fight with Chemo & radiation a miracle happened - I was still alive and the sarcoma was still there, but no longer active!! I am terminal though, it will grow back - but it was four years ago this Dec since found!!! Please give your friend my support & love - sarcomas are so rare!! Goodluck x l************e (454 )  6:21 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> We were a cool auction this morning, not sure if we still are! Thanks :) 6:47 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Does the winner get a copy of the birth certificate as a proof? and will there be a meeting with the winner? p******b (131 )  6:34 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> You would get a photo copy of the birth certificate as we would need to keep the original for future use ( to get a passport etc ) and sorry there would be no meeting the winner. Thanks 6:48 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Is there a way I can donate direct instead of going through the auction process? Wouldn't be the full amount but some is better than none. c*********t (1 )  6:55 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Your absolutely right, even $1 makes a difference. I can't list the account on here please see previous comments for link to Facebook support group which has the account number on. Thank you :) 6:58 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> hi, great idea, hope you get there, can i ask what your friends middle name is - i also thought one of you could be molly the other could be .... but perhaps not frank. i***e (157 )  7:01 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Sadly I don't know Molly's middle name. We wouldn't mind Molly and the other frank, at the end of the day it's not up to us unless we bid ;) thanks 7:11 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> hi you girls are so loving wanting to help your friend i cant afford to bid but i could donate 20 dollers to her fund keep up the good work all the best :) k*******1 (46 )  7:22 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> That's would be absolutely amazing if you could. There's a link above. Thanks for the support! 7:30 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Hey girls - not really interested in bidding for the naming rights but would love to be able to contribute to Molly's trip. Have you considered setting up a bank account so people could donate? You girls are doing a wonderful thing and Molly is lucky to have friends like you. t****r (188 )  7:28 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Her sister has set up a Facebook page and bank account please follow the link above. Thanks for your support :) 7:31 pm, Fri 16 Nov

<p> Hi there, I'm a journalist based in Kapiti - have you had any local media coverage yet? With Molly being from Paraparaumu it may help to promote what you are doing in the media here. Let me know if you are interested through the response to this question, and maybe we could communicate via the Facebook page if so. Best of luck! n****3 (137 )  8:44 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> We have had nz herald involved but that's it so far. Would love to have your help. If you could comment on the Molly's journey page we can message you and go from there :) 8:51 pm, Fri 16 Nov
<p> Hi Katy and Lynda .... WOW you girls are awesome and amazing friends of Molly, just to answer a couple of questions, Mollys middle name is Jane and there will be an article in Kapiti News next week about Mollys Journey..... Thanks to all the bidders and the positive comments and feedback. Thanks girls x0x0 r****a (86 )  9:11 pm, Fri 16 Nov

<p> Awesome suggestion! We have had a few, hopefully the winner picks a good one :) 9:39 pm, Fri 16 Nov

<p> Thank you, we are just pleased we have only had one negative comment. We will assume she was asking cause her last name is gold digger or something along those lines ;). The good comments outweigh the negative. Thank you for your support :) 11:03 pm, Fri 16 Nov

<p> What amazing people you two are, im totally touched by your endevour. I don't doubt that you will make enough money to send Molly on 2 trips of a lifetime! Maybe you guys can join her? All the best, STAY STRONG Molly, MIRACLES DO HAPPEN xx c***k (367 )  8:42 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> I hope so! This is a trip she wants with her family as she was born down there so we won't be joining her but she has a few other things she would like to do if it goes over however much she needs for her trip. Thanks :) 8:57 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Hi girls, I just wanted to let you know about something you should bring to your friend - hydrogen peroxide, or oxygen therapy. Cancer can't survive in oxygen-rich environments, as it's anaerobic, and blood should be aerobic (oxygen rich). It's worth looking into, it's cured a lot of people and brought them back from the brink! Google oxygen therapy, h202. There's also a place in Auckland that administers Intravenous vitamin C direct to the blood for the same effect. :) l******n (159 )  8:53 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> That's very interesting will pass this on to Molly. Thank you :) 8:58 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Oxygen therapy can be very dangerous and also does not work. - Please don't use alternative medicine on your friend - read here about the problems with oxygen theory and also do some research yourself - http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/O xygen_therapy d****5 (48 )  9:30 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Everyone has their own opinions. It may be easiest if people don't recommend treatments. We are here to raise money for her and pick some interesting middle names :) but thanks for the support :) 9:51 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> I know how you feel when someone close to you gets cancer & you want to help! My mum has been diagnosed with breast cancer & I too have an auction running to try & raise the money to go home to the Uk. Its horrible when your so far away from home & cant get back when something serious like this happens! Its great to have special friends like you two in her life. All the best to you All and Molly, all the best hun :) h***4 (942 )  9:39 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> I hope you get the money you need to get home :) thanks for the supprt 9:51 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Think what you girls are doing is totally amazing & very special to all involved. At present I am leading the auction and live on the kapiti coast. Think it would be nice to have lynda Molly & katy frank as the middles names but feel it would be more special and memorable to have your friend Molly choose your middle names seen you are doing this for her. What better way to symbolise a tight friendship. All the best to you all & may Molly & her family get the trip she's dreaming of & deserves k*******l (439 )  10:26 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Thank you so much for your generosity! We like your idea too and Molly will as well. Hopefully you win :) 10:39 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> have emailed auction to Campbell Live - he always gets such good response for this kind of thing. Other people should email him too campbellliveATtv3.co.nz just email the auction to him. Best of luck! you are all amazing xx j****o (418 )  10:33 am, Sat 17 Nov

<p> Hi girls, I think you are amazing girls doing this for your friend and I would love to support that but I tried to give $10 but I could only place a bid for $1540 which is a bit to much for me ;-( I would go for jules and tui but why just because I love them where Moll and Moll would be lovely to &lt;3. So if you could let me know how to be able to pay that would be great. xxx m*****s (53 )  10:43 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> That's ok it's gotten pretty expensive! Please follow this link http://www.facebook.com/Mollys Journey/info?ref=ts where there is an account you can donate money into. Thank you so much for the support :) 10:47 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Hi! Great Idea! Are you guys twins? I'm a twin and so are my other brothers (2 sets). None of us were given middle names at birth but were always told we could choose our own. I'm the only one who did.. Always felt wierd not having one for some reason but my bros don't mind.. All the very best for your auction. Wish I had the money to bid.. r********s (9313 )  10:49 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> No we aren't twins! A lot of people ask that, we have a third sister who looks similar we get asked if we are triplets! Just plain old singles haha. Thanks for the support :) 10:52 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> The auction is already is way out of my range but wonder if you might put up an account to which a smaller donation may be made? May I also suggest you bring the media's attention to your auction and the cause you are assisting - it is very appealing? s******2 (492 )  10:58 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Yes please follow the link in the above comments and there is a account number you and make a donation. We have contacted a few radio stations and news people, still waiting for a response from most. Thanks for your support :) 11:07 am, Sat 17 Nov
<p> all the very best for what you are both doing for your friend molly; my wishes for her and her family. r******7 (12 )  12:22 pm, Sat 17 Nov

<p> This idea has so much merit...well done girls. Its a bit pricey for the average person to bid but there is so much potential for office syndicates and even schools to rally around financially and then have a draw or vote amongst the students to come up with the perfect names - it could go mad! (we hope) All the very best :) r******e (429 )  12:32 pm, Sat 17 Nov
<p> WOW such a cool thing you are doing for your friend. The world needs more people like the 2 of you. I sadly don't have enough money to bid. But i think Charity and Hope would make awesome middle names for the both of you. t********h (28 )  12:48 pm, Sat 17 Nov
<p> congratulations xxx,my brother was given a 1% chance of survival and is now back at work and full of beans,you just never know whats going to happen,moll moll is blessed already to have you in her life,but im picking she already knows that.Do you know what month they will be in the south island?,might be able to help with a trip to abel tasman national park.021864668 m******r (204 )  1:22 pm, Sat 17 Nov

<p> Dear Lynda and Katy, you epitomise all the best Kiwi traits. When I am missing my homeland, on the other side of the World, things like what you are doing lift my spirits and remind me of all the good things in New Zealand, especially the good people. I am trying to find what and how much I can do to help with your trip. However much or little I can contribute with, you girls are very welcome to stay in my house if you stop by in Christchurch during your trip. Good luck! a*****e (90 )  1:26 pm, Sat 17 Nov

<p> Shame on stacie5 asking such a disgusting and inappriate question! Tell me, have your yourself ever watched someone you love live with cancer?! It is the HARDEST thing in the world when all you want to do is take away the pain and the suffering. Think before you post such revolting questions! Lynda and Katy, I think Hope and Faith would be perfect considering the heart you girls have. :) I can't bid but all the best. :) If you don't mind me asking, what is Mollie's prognosis for survival? t**********2 (131 )  5:24 pm, Sat 17 Nov

<p> I can't go that high, but just my two cents... I would go over the top tacky medieval / fantasy on it! Dragonsanctum and Glimmerblade. Those kind of names would be like scars, scars that you can be proud of, because you girls are so sweet! Hope you get heaps! Goodluck! b**********r (5 )  5:57 pm, Sat 17 Nov

<p> you girls are awesome, what a cool idea to do something like this for your friend molly. i like molly and frank as the names:) :). i do have to say that i am disgusted at the comment from stacie5, why anyone would write that is beyond me, its very attention seeking. good on yas girls you should be very proud! good luck with your auction and good luck to molly!! (such a gorgeous girl!). :) b*****o (17 )  7:26 pm, Sat 17 Nov

<p> Unsure what this means but thanks for the comment :) 7:44 pm, Sat 17 Nov
<p> What a pity you did not receive a cent for every page view. As they say a lot of cents can build a lot of dollars. If you need a film crew. Now there's an idea. Do not change your first names as a dad I would be disappointed, Adding Molly and Frank seem alright for middle names. Best Wishes to you all. p******x (46 )  7:48 pm, Sat 17 Nov
<p> You girls truely are amazing friends. And Molly is hell hot(yummy). I don't have the funds to bid but what I can afford and have done for you guys is spent a bit of time sending emails to high profile places to raise the awareness of this auction. It's not much but if everyone who would love to help these girls out in making Mollys' dream come tru, get on the phone or email people with power and let them know what these girls are doing. We all might be surprised who can help! Stay Strong MollyXO m*******8 (102 )  8:41 pm, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Thank you very much, we have tried a few places but not having much luck. Thank you for caring :) 8:48 pm, Sat 17 Nov
<p> Hi. You girls are doing a great job. What an idea to raise money for your friend. I was considering "MONK" the first 2 and last 2 letters of MOlly fraNK. Monk is someone who devotes his/her life for someone else. Cheers g*******1 (23 )  8:52 pm, Sat 17 Nov

<p> I have asked the angels what your names are mean't to be. The names you are meant to have which I believe you were always destined to have were Mawu for the dark haired sister, it means "mother earth"', your life purpose involves environmentalism. You say it MAH-woo. The other blonde sister's name should be Guinevere. It means true love. The universe will deliver great love to you, you pronouce it GWIN-uh-veer. I will ask the universe to provide for me to make this happen for you both. k*******1 (43 )  1:34 pm, Sun 18 Nov

<p> Sorry have had to withdraw your bid as we are unsure of your intentions. Being a poor student and making your own auction to get to australia because you any afford makes us wonder how you would pay for this. I it's attentions you want for your auction your going about it the wrong way. If anything this will cause negative attention. Good luck with your auction :) 7:21 am, Mon 19 Nov

<p> This is so cool. I'm sorry I can't bid. I'm sure you'll raise an awesome amount for Molly and I just hope that someone out there, wealthier than me, will do something for you two. I know you just want the focus to be on her, but a thank-you to you both would not detract from that. I just wish I could do both. To Molly - good luck, be strong, take joy from those that obviously love you dearly. t*****i (201 )  3:36 pm, Mon 19 Nov

<p> Blaahblaah has withdrawn her auction ..... wonder why? Maybe she feels raising money for a jolly in Aussie doesn't really compare to what you wonderful girls are doing and had a case of the guilts! Here's hoping that is the reason. Shared TM account my a*se! She needs a reality check. Anyway, rant over, you girls are wonderful. My mum has a brain tumour and given 15 months to live, but she's still fighting, 3 years later. Hope Molly has a wonderful trip and makes lasting memories for all. b********5 (15 )  4:50 pm, Mon 19 Nov

You hear all the time in the news people going overseas for tricky op's like this cos doctors over here say they cant do it but yet there are better doctors overseas can.. And they can take hearts out of bodies these days and keep the body going with machines while things are fixed etc.Hope all goes well d****1 (925 )  8:14 am, Tue 20 Nov

<p> What wonderful friends you girls are... a very creative way to raise money for your dear friend. Well done girls :) I would love to buy the jar of Marmite off mysticbabe... if she could email me I would deposit money into the account for Molly and pay her for the freight.

The Q&A has been hillariously entertaining too! Good luck to Molly, your family, and friends as you continue on your journey. I hope you achieve all that you are meant to! Well done to all those kind Southerners and the offers they have made so far, I'm sure there'll be more to come. Best wishes and blessings to you all :-) k******1 (155 )  12:10 pm, Tue 20 Nov
<p> Hi Girls, what you are doing for your friend is amazing!

<p> sorry about the comment double up lol but thats great to hear your gna look into it, im not to sure how effective it is in late stages of cancer but it has cured before, even i saw a story of a very young girl, her cancer had been cured through cannabis oil treatments, with NO serious side effects what so ever, unlike chemo and taking mad made drugs that end up making more sick, i wish more people new about the benifets of an natural cure for cancer ; PURE CANNABIS OIL - Tetrahydrocannabinoil. l************r (41 )  5:08 pm, Tue 20 Nov

<p> HI again :) ... thanks for answering my question [ on 18/11/12 at 8.28 pm ] ... I still have yet to hear from the Frank family with regards to my idea of running a listing in parallel with yours ... proceeds going towards your cause ... so I think I may just carry on as suggested ... if item sold I shall make the proper arrangement with the buyer after the auction ... Please let me know which bank is the account belonging to ... CHEERS :) b*******e (57 )  11:56 pm, Tue 20 Nov
<p> You should both have as middle names the letter "I". When asked what does I stand for, tell them "I stand for inspiration, friendship, compassion, helpfulness, benevolence, gratitude, empathy, courage, etc." Very generous and inspirational of you to be doing this. Good luck with the auction and the fundraising. a***g (100 )  11:37 am, Wed 21 Nov

<p> Well done, coming up with such a great fundraiser. I hope all the publicity isn't too exhausting for Molly and yourselves, and that you have plenty of time to just 'hang' together. I advise Molly to start planning asap as I am sure that the $$$ will magically appear as needed as NZ people are very generous. The sooner she gets on the road the more energy she will have to enjoy it. I know from experience how cancer can take the stuffing out of you very quickly. Good luck! ..xx.. a********e (518 )  11:03 am, Fri 23 Nov

<p> I am a friend of Molly's mum Jo and old neighbour and have just started another Trademe auction for Molly :-) I had put it on hold due to your fabulous auction but thought today being Molly's birthday it would be a good day to start it! Its listed as 'Magic Pennies for Molly's Journey'. 100% of all funds raised will go to Molly and her family. For those that can no longer afford to bid on this one please bid on the 'magic pennies' and help support Molly's Magical South Island Holiday xoxox s*******e (1293 )  7:50 pm, Fri 23 Nov

<p> Hi thank you for the offer! Our parents decided the day after we listed it they would cover all the fees, reporter didn't read that haha! If you would like to make a donation this is the account Thank you :) Account name Molly frank Account number 010731023046708 http://m.facebook.com/home.php ?ref=tn_tnmn&__user=594547 798#!/MollysJourney?__user=594 547798 8:01 pm, Fri 23 Nov
<p> An idea to save you time: You could write the account details for donations on a large piece of paper and take a pic of Molly holding it, then add it to your pictures. I am pretty sure they let you add pictures or swap them around even after bidding has started. That would save you constantly rewriting or cutting and pasting them in the answers. Just an idea which might make life easier. :-) a********e (518 )  8:48 pm, Fri 23 Nov
<p> That's a really good idea!! We are out for Molly's birthday at the moment but will try out best to do that tomorrow :) thanks 8:59 pm, Fri 23 Nov

<p> Heya well done you two! Just a tip - maybe if people ask a question twice then copy and paste the answer to the repeated questions? Cos I initially thought you were being rude by just answering with a full stop to some reasonable questions, until I realised they were repeats. I'm very sure you're not meaning to be rude. But it's such a great idea for an auction. Good luck, and all the best for Molly! xx s*******6 (28 )  8:27 pm, Sat 24 Nov
<p> I am so Sorry you thought that! As we have had over 300 questions it would be very time consuming copying and pasting for all the double ups as some people have the question up to 6 times. We aren't being rude just feeling very overwhelmed and making sure we definitely answer the question atleast once :) thanks 9:38 pm, Sat 24 Nov

<p> Hi, I have followed this auciton very closely from the start and just want to congratulate you both on how you have answered all the questions with great dignity and respect. I think you have been so patient as it wouldn't of always been easy. Hope it goes real well tomorrow. d******y (50 )  9:49 pm, Sat 24 Nov
<p> One of the nicest comments! Your right it has been hard we both work full time and would wake up each morning with over 20 comments! We didn't know what we got ourselves in for but it has definitely been life changing a worth it! We couldn't be more pleased with the outcome as it is now.

<p> hi, I think you two are amazing! No need to answer this - I realise you have heaps of questions to deal with. Just wanted to say (a) thanks for posting bank details, has enabled me to make a *very* small contribution, and (b) not sure if it's possible (maybe an email to watchers, at least?) but would be great to hear what names you end up with! I feel really humbled by what you're doing, well done, such kindness and dignity. Good luck. w******7 (126 )  11:45 pm, Sat 24 Nov
<p> Hi thank you! There are almost 2000 watchers haha I'm unsure how I would send an email to them all? The dominion post has said they are going to do a follow up story so everyone knows the outcome. Thanks :) 9:42 am, Sun 25 Nov
<p> Hi girls - Goodluck for the auction finishing today! I hope it ends with a bang :-) I can't afford to bid, I'm fighting my own Sarcoma battle (I posted comment earlier on about my journey!) & as much as I would love to bid, don't have the resources to do so. For such young ladies (not saying I'm old... 30 *cough*) you have handled yourselves with such maturity, far beyond your years!

<p> Haha so do we :) thanks 3:32 pm, Sun 25 Nov
<p> No need to reply, but thought that if Molly chooses the names for you, maybe she has a middle name of her own you could also use, so that one of you has Molly, and the other is also a nice feminine name. Or maybe Frankie as an extension of Molly's last name. Would be nice to remind you of this time and also be pretty, just like you two! :-) I look forward to reading your final choice on facebook. Like many, I don't buy papers. No reply needed. a********e (518 )  3:35 pm, Sun 25 Nov
