<p> I like the approach to this book. The author breaks everything down in "laymen" terms and gives you examples with his own experience as well. He also gives you tips on training (ie. conditioning for upland bird hunting, field trials,guarding) and to let the dog do their natural thing and how to enforce this as positive behavior. My pyrenees is pretty stubborn and after reading other books on "positive reinformcement only" i.e. treats I was starting to get discouraged.It was not doing the trick. but this book states that you need to find the "drive" behind the dog in order for positive reinforcement to work. If you feed them before training, obviously getting a treat won't work because there "drive" food, has already been met.
<p> I was also surprised that many dog owners make the mistake of calling "come" to there dog when he runs away and won't listen to you.(Myself included). This is the wrong thing to do because your conditioning the dog to "run away" by associating the word "come" to it. How to solve this problem... You will have to read the book..
<p> First I'd like to correct the TOTALLY ERRONEOUS statement someone else made in their review that this book used force to achieve anything. That is precisely the opposite of what Dr. Whitney recommends, and I think that person had never even looked at the book.
<p> These methods are fast, simple, easy to follow, and use the dog's own innate wishes to achieve success. For instance, training to sit, down, shake. Place dog on a table - might have to secure him to something if he wants to jump down. Take treat, hold over nose and contine to move it back until dog sits. When it sits, give treat and reward with a "good boy". Does that sound like the dog is forced into position? No, and the rest of the training in the book is similar. Hold treat below table to teach down, hold just out of reach for shake, etc.
<p> He suggests separation from the family as correction, not rewarding bad behavior by lots of attention, simply taking the dog and putting him up when he misbehaves.
<p> You won't find a better book, IMO. You'll find modern people who took his basic ideas, changed them a little bit (like adding an operant for a faster sound reward) and wrote a book. They are good too. But in my view, this original book is best for the easiest, most practical advice you'll ever get.
<p> A friend of mine, a K9 officer, recommended this book to me. Personally, I don't see any real-world applicable information in this tome. Sure, it's filled with psychological studies, but I wanted more of a hands-on book which would help me train/tame my Australian Kelpie, and this was not it.
