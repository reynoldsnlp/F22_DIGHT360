<h> Intercollegiate Socialist Society
<p> The Intercollegiate Socialist Society was a Socialist student organization active from 1905-1921. It attracted many prominent intellectuals and writers and acted as an unofficial student wing of the Socialist Party of America . The Society sponsored lecture tours, magazines, seminars and discussion circles all over the US aimed at propagating socialist ideas among America's college population. The group expanded into a philosophy in the 1920s that did not focus exclusively, or even primarily on college students. To symbolize the shift in emphasis, the group changed its name to the League for Industrial Democracy in 1921.
<p> Over the signatures of these and other prominent public figures, in the Spring of 1905 Sinclair issued a call for the formation of a new organization, a group to be called the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. [ 1 ]
<p> The new organization gathered for the first time shortly after the start of the new academic year, meeting on September 12, 1905 in a room at a restaurant in lower Manhattan . [ 2 ] About one hundred supporters of the new organization attended this meeting, chaired by Sinclair, including a number of prominent socialist intellectuals. [ 2 ] The gathering elected Jack London as the first president of the organization, Sinclair as first vice-president, and millionaire philanthropist J. Graham Phelps Stokes as second vice-president, with anti-child labor activist Owen R. Lovejoy chosen as treasurer. [ 2 ]
<p> The Intercollegiate Socialist Society set goals for its organization. It sought to promote and intelligent interest in Socialism among college men and women, [ 3 ] familiarize students with the inherent evils of [the] American economic and social system based on laissez-faire policies, [ 4 ] and promote the establishment of a socialist order. [ 5 ] The Intercollegiate Socialist Society was sought to achieve these goals by organizing chapters on college campuses, introduce socialist supporters into society, and bring socialist party members into labor unions, schools, and government. [ 6 ]
<p> Rules were laid down as to how to structure the collegiate chapters of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, organizing students on each campus into individual chapters who would fund the central organization through a small percentage of their membership dues collected to the national Society. Chapters would appoint officers, consisting of a President, two Vice Presidents, a Secretary, and a Treasurer, who would be elected annually by the vote of the entire society. The Societys activities would be overseen by these appointed individuals along with six additional members who would form an Executive Committee.
<p> The Intercollegiate Socialist Society organized slowly at first, as chapters were banned in most colleges and universities by conservative administrators who had the power to prohibit establishment of student organizations. Chapters slowly came to existence, frequently with names that did not signify its connection to the Intercollegiate Socialist Society at all, an example being the Wesleyan Social Study Club of Wesleyan University , which was one of the first collegiate organizations associated with the Intercollegiate Socialist Society as well as a chapter established at Columbia University .
<p> In 1921, the Society recognized that socialism had become extremely unpopular in the United States after the violent Russian revolution. While its objectives to promote socialism in the United States didn't change, the name was changed to the League for Industrial Democracy .
