<p> Lyrics: It was just last Sunday I was sitting in the pew The preacher told some stories Yeah he spoke about the truth Something resonated I heard a million times before Somehow I needed to hear it once more, he said
<p> CHORUS I could use a little more Jesus And a little bit less of me I could be a little more humble If we're speaking honestly The more I see this heart inside of me The more that I believe I could use a little more Jesus And a little bit less of me
<p> I try to love my neighbor And love my enemy I went down to the homeless shelter and I Gave them food to eat It made me feel so good inside But it did not bring me peace Turns out there's just one thing that I need
<p> CHORUS
<p> We've got rules and regulations Got a stance on everything It gets so complicated When all we really need
<p> Is just a little more Jesus And a little bit less of me I could be a little more humble If we're speaking honestly The more I see this heart inside of me The more that I believe That I could use a little more Jesus And a little bit less of me
<p> CHORUS
<p> I could use a little more Jesus 3x And a little bit less of me I could use a little more Jesus 3x And a little bit less of me A little bit less of me
