<p> The song originally appeared on Allen's Myspace page in 2008 alongside the songs "I Could Say" and "I Don't Know" (later released as " The Fear ") under the title "Guess Who Batman". The song samples the piano of the theme to the Australian television show Neighbours. The song was written by Allen and Greg Kurstin . Allen wrote:
<p> "
<p> We are the youth, we can make coolness for our future, it's up to us. Go green and hate hate. [ 7 ]
<p> "
<p> Despite its titular reference to the Caped Crusader , according to NME and Rolling Stone magazines the song is a George W. Bush protest. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] At an 2 April 2009 concert at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, Allen stated that the song was about Bush. [ 8 ] At a concert in So Paulo, Brazil, Allen stated "It was originally written about this fucking arsehole who used to be the President of the United States of America. His name is George W. Bush." [ 10 ]
<p> The Urban Review states that it was originally inspired by the right-wing British National Party , adding Allen now "feels the track is relevant everywhere now so has removed a particular target." [ 11 ] At the 2009 Glastonbury Festival prior to performing the song, Allen made reference to the elections to the European parliament that had commenced three weeks earlier in which the British National Party gained their first ever representative seats, citing this as a reason to sing the song.

<p> The song made its chart debut at number 37 on the Canadian Top 100 on 28 February 2009 despite not being released as an actual single. The song also entered the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 68 on the same week, being her third song on entry. [ 12 ]
<p> In the UK the song made its debut on the UK Singles Chart at number 154 on the strength of digital downloads due to the video having a lot of airplay on UK music channels despite not being released as an official single there. [ 13 ]
<p> A music video for the song was posted on the official Parlophone YouTube page on 15 June 2009. EMI hired the French production company Frenzy Paris who in turn hired the art collective AB/CD/CD and the post-production company "Firm". The video is shot from Allen's point of view (she can be seen using a polaroid she takes of herself). She is seen to be making the journey from her hotel room to a television studio. Throughout the video, Allen warps the shape and size of her surroundings using her hands and her own perspective; for example, by moving her hands apart she stretches the Eiffel Tower and enlarges a man's afro hairstyle.

<p> The song was chosen as the theme song for the TV programme Periodismo para todos ( Spanish : Journalism for everybody ) in Argentina. Periodismo para todos is a controversial Argentine television program that has been labeled as investigative journalism . [ 15 ] The song was chosen because it had been used in a telenovela of the state-owned TV Pblica , in a poor Spanish translation. The opening of the show features photos of the audience making the " fuck you " sign. [ 16 ] The song has a medium rotation on radio stations like La 100 , from Buenos Aires (owned by Grupo Clarn , which also belongs Canal 13 (Argentina) who broadcast Periodismo para todos weekly). However, it was the second most popular song of 2012 in the chart show TUS 25 ( Spanish : Your 25 ) of Tu Dial, [ 17 ] an argentinian web radio station based in Mexico. The song was performed by The Sockapellas in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect .
