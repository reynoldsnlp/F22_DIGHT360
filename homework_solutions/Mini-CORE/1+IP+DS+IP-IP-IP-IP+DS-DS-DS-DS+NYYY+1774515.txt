<p> Purchasing your first home can sometimes seem a little hard. There is so much information you have to provide, and how do you know you're going to get the loan? Come and talk to us at Oliver Mortgage & Insurance and we will help you on your way.
<p> Some of our clients are people buying their 2nd or 3rd property after we helped them into their first home . It is our job to know and understand the process and make it easier for you to make what is often the biggest decision in a person's life.

<p> Free Mortgage advice and solutions
<p> Free insurance support and great products
<p> What makes this team different from the rest, is that we were working in this very industry during the last major economic upheaval that Kiwi's experienced - the 1980's. So we have seen it before and we can help you source the money you need to get that home or property you want.

<h> Buying a home is always a challenge. Access to KiwiSaverT has made things easier, but before you race out to grab that money and the available subsidies, here are the RULES:
<p> Housing NZ Subsidy - $1,000 per year that you have contributed is available after 3 years, and up to a MAXIMUM of $5,000 for those that have contributed for at least 5 years.
<p> The subsidy CANNOT be used as the deposit -- it is only made available on the SETTLEMENT day of the property purchase.
<p> There is a MAXIMUM property purchase value of $300,000 in most locations otherwise the subsidy NO LONGER applies.
<p> Example: We helped a recent young couple on the journey to their first home. They were entitled to a Housing NZ subsidy of $3000. The property they were considering was going to auction. They knew they had to purchase at $300,000 or less otherwise they would lose their subsidy entitlement. If they went to $301,000 -- the house would have effectively cost them $304,000.
<p> So as their broker we sat with them during the auction and at the end they walked away knowing they had their first home at the right price and had an additional $3,000 towards their home ownership goal -- the ideal result and one we are happy to have helped with!
