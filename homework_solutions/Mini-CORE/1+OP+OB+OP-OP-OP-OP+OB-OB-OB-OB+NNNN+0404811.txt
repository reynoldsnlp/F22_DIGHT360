<p> Once somebody is labelled as a racist, it is a very difficult tag to get rid of. It is something that clings onto your name in newspaper reports. It is something that tarnishes your reputation as a player. Once again, the subject of racism in football has resurfaced.
<p> Last week saw England's John Terry fined 220,000 and banned for four matches after being charged with racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand.
<p> I don't think anyone disputes that if you are found guilty of racism that you should be punished. However, the English Football Association's way of punishing people seems rather odd.
<p> Last year Joey Barton was banned for 12 matches for violent conduct, as well as being fined 75,000. Liverpool's Luis Suarez was found guilty by the FA of racially abusing Patrice Evra, and was suspended for 8 matches and fined 40,000. Back in 2003, Rio Ferdinand was banned for 8 months and fined 50,000 for missing a drugs test.

<p> Yesterday, former England captain John Terry was found guilty of racially abusing a fellow professional and was banned for 4 matches and fined 220,000.
<p> I'm hoping that it is as apparent to you as it is to me that there simply is no consistency in the punishments that the FA is now using to deal with its players.
<p> Using the above examples, do we then suppose that the FA rates missing a drugs test as a crime which is far greater than racially abusing a fellow player? Is displaying violence on the pitch a crime far greater than using words that are totally unacceptable in our society?
<p> We're very lucky that in the UK that we live in a society that doesn't tolerate racism, and we even have initiatives set up and funded by sports clubs, such as the Kick it Out , campaign that reinforce this message.
<p> Racism isn't tolerated within our football grounds and football in the UK is all the better for it. This is probably what makes the John Terry case all the more surprising. A former England captain is not the sort of person you expect to be embroiled in a case such as this. To even be accused of something such as racism is something which jars with our culture.
<p> As a Liverpool fan, it makes me question why John Terry was banned for just 4 games whilst Suarez got 8. If the FA wants to make a statement about how they deal with racism, then they need to have fixed guidelines of what the ban should be. In fact, if they want to prevent outbursts of this nature and show a real stance against racism, then they should make bans even longer.
<p> The FA need to set the example to the world, as other governing bodies are not strong enough in their punishment of racism.. The Spanish and Russian football federations were both charged by UEFA after their fans were heard to be making racist chants and even monkey noises towards black players. The fine for this offence was just _30,000 and _20,000 respectively.
<p> In 2012, we all like to believe we live in a civilised society. A civilised society does not tolerate behaviour such as this and football needs to kick it out, once and for all.
