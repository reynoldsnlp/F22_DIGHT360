<p> On this highly influential 1959 album, Ornette Coleman's unique writing style and idiosyncratic solo language forever changed the jazz landscape. On classics such as "Lonely Woman", "Congeniality", and "Focus on Sanity", Coleman used the tunes' moods and melodic contours, rather than their chords, as a basis for his improvisations. In so doing, he opened up jazz soloing immensely and ushered in new freedoms--both individually and collectively. Lest these innovations sound too dry or abstract, it must be noted that both Coleman and trumpeter Don Cherry play with a deep-felt emotion and joy that is as infectious today as it was then. This is truly an essential jazz recording, marking the end of one era, providing the blueprint for the next. -- Wally Shoup
<p> A recent BBC series about jazz described the year this album was released (along with those by Dave Brubeck, Charles Mingus and Miles Davies) as the year that changed jazz and this album as one of the key influences and the start of free jazz. For many listeners this could be a major turn-off - but don't be, this is fabulous listening.
<p> Coleman has an original approach to jazz that focusses on not on chords but individual expression. The opening moments of the first track, Lonely Woman, has Coleman and Cherry playing together without chords but it all merges to be exciting, emotional playing. The remaining tracks build on this and as a piece this creates a memorable album.
<p> like many jazz enthusiasts, I have lost whole evenings to free jazz and wondered why I'd bothered. This album shows what can be done in the hands of a master.
<p> This is the ideal place to start for anyone interested in Coleman and a recording to rank along Kind of Blue and A Love Supreme. Coleman's departure ("abandonment" is too prejudicial a word) from the chord-based blues and jazz tradition gave him a reputation for difficulty before his forays into free jazz but, as I once read, the startling thing about "The Shape of Jazz to Come" is how melodic and rhythmic is it. "Lonely Woman", stately, mournful and passionate, is one of the finest openings to an album ever but the quality does not abate. The interplay between Coleman and Don Cherry on cornet is spellbinding and the Haden-Higgins bass and drums section is integral in propelling the music with a frequent spring and swing (witness Haden's bassline, including the bowed opening, on the centrepiece "Peace").
<p> This is not a recording to fear or from which to shy. It is groundbreaking but accessible. I had the pleasure to see Coleman live a few years ago on his 75th birthday. His engaged and even ferocious playing belied his frailty and disarming modesty and compelled me to return to his blueprint literally of the shape of jazz to come. To paraphrase someone, this recording is, and is intended to be, seminal.
<p> In my opinion this is the finest of Ornette's albums from the Altantic era, his debut for the label, and an album imbued with a drive and momentum all its own. In many ways, aside from it being one of the great "free" jazz records, I often consider it to be one of my favourite "blues" albums of all time as well. From the affecting "Lonely Woman", to the terrific "Eventually", Ornette's musical aesthetic is perfectly summed up with this recording. Of course, there's many more fine albums to get by this great musician, but for me this one remains the one I return to time and again, twenty years on. The group is outstanding, and as an example of improvised music it's right up there. You have to "go with" Ornette Coleman as a listener, but his musical message is such a powerful and engaging one that to "expect the unexpected" soon becomes a joy.
