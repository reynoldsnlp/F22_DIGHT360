<h> Customer Quotes
<p> "The Strunk and White of the 21st century!"
<p> -- Michael Levin New York Times best selling co-author of Making Jack Falcone
<p> Your book helped me in two ways. First, my boss was very impressed that I sought out a resource for writing. Chalk up one gold star by my name! Second, I wrote a 20+ paper for a graduate course immediately after I read your book. Not only did I receive an A on the paper, but my professor also recommended I submit my paper to the University for publication. That professor, a Ph.D., is a stickler on grammar and writing style! For the first time, I was awarded the full 100%. Gold star #2!

<h> What Our Clients Say
<p> "Reading this book was completely painless. In fact, it was quite enjoyable. And it may be written in plain English, but plain certainly does not translate to dull here. 'Get to the Point' is full of life, witty and entertaining, and above all else, informative. Elizabeth Danziger delivers on her promises, and then some.
<p> Danziger's use of imagery was surprising, pleasantly so. Books dealing with similar subject matter can often read like instruction manuals; the information may be accurate (you hope) but the way it is presented can put even the hardiest insomniac to sleep. Danziger manages to entertain, showcasing her wit and insight, while displaying a clear understanding of the subject matter and how to teach it to other people."
