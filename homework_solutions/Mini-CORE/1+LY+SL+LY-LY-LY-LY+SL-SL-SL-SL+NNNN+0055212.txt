<h> Take Me on the Floor Lyrics
<h> Veronicas
<p> The lights are out and I barely know you We're going up and the place is slowing down I knew you'd come around You captivated me, something about you has got me I was lonely now you make me feel alive Will you be mine tonight? Take me on the floor, I can't take it any more I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love Just take me on the floor, I can give you more You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch My heart is racing as you're moving closer You take me higher with every breath I take Would it be wrong to stay? One look at you and I know what you're thinking Time's a bitch and my heart is sinking down You turn me inside out Take me on the floor, I can't take it any more I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love Just take me on the floor, I can give you more You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch I wanna kiss a girl I wanna kiss a girl I wanna kiss a boy I wanna I wanna kiss a girl (Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya) I wanna kiss a girl (Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya) I wanna kiss a boy (Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya) I wanna kiss a, kiss a, kiss a Take me on the floor, I can't take it any more I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love Just take me on the floor, I can give you more You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch Take me on the floor, I can't take it any more I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love Just take me on the floor, I can give you more You kill me, you kill me, please don't stop
