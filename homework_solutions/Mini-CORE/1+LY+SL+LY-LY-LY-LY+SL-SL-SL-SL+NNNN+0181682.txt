<h> From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart Lyrics - Britney Spears
<p> "Never look back," we said How was I to know I'd miss you so? Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind Where do I go?
<p> And you didn't hear All my joy through my tears All my hopes through my fears Did you know, still I miss you somehow
<p> [CHORUS:] From the bottom of my broken heart There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know You were my first love, you were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love 'Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart
<p> "Baby," I said, "please stay. Give our love a chance for one more day" We could have worked things out Taking time is what love's all about
<p> But you put a dart Through my dreams through my heart And I'm back where I started again Never thought it would end
<p> [Repeat CHORUS]
<p> You promised yourself But to somebody else And you made it so perfectly clear Still I wish you were here
<p> [Repeat CHORUS]
<p> "Never look back," we said How was I to know I'd miss you so?

<p> This song reminds me of my first kiss ex-boyfriend... I just wish that we're still together again, but I know that will never happen because he's been acting like he doesn't even care about me anymore.. I loved him so much & I love him still.. My love for him never stops. Never. I miss him so much right now, I wish he would call me, but I know he wouldn't...& every night, I kept praying to myself that he would call me the next day..but yet, he didn't.... I kept doing that & somehow, I know it's all just a waste of time & everything but even though I said "I hate him" to almost all of my friends, deep inside..the feeling killed me...over & over again. I just hope I could of just move on with life...& right now, I'm standing in the middle of my decision that is moving on & waiting for him to get me back...

<p> I had a friend (more than a friend) 6 years ago. But i still remember him and miss him a lot. Everyday I hope that he will come back to me but I know he won't. I don't know what I should do. Only I know is that I want to stay in the past with him. I like this song very much
<p> My first boyfriend | Reviewer: Anonymous | 4/29/11
<p> I listen this song since I was in high school. when I listen this song I feel pain deep inside my heart but I never thought it's actually become true in my life time. I don't know why I still think that he will come back in one day even he had make it clear enough!

<p> so ture | Reviewer: anna | 11/2/08
<p> I love this song, when it first came out i was just a little girl in grade school who adored britney, and now her songs have actual meaning to me. This song really speaks to me beacuse recently my Best Guy friend who i was madly in love with, married someone eles out of the blue. He really was my first and true love, and the lyrics to the bridge "You promised yourself, but to somebody else; And you made it so perfectly clear; Still I wish you were here now" is so true to me, he was everything i wanted and i thought he loved me, i thought we were destand, but he gave everything i wanted to someone eles, and he's gone forever, but i still want him so badly i will always love him
<p> Broke! | Reviewer: Jolis | 9/20/08
<p> It was a great s0ng. Britney sing that s0ng with heart and it touch me. Especialy in d line 'never th0ugh it w0uld end' its realy me. I never th0ugh my ex say g0odbye with0ut a clear reason. Hate u dude! Haha..lol
<p> Wow, it reminds of my 1st crush. I will give up that I fall in love my crush almost 1 year, he still don't like me back. I'm tired of waiting for him say love me or like me. IF he still don't like me, so I will give up and I'll be 100% single! I will take to some time...:\
<p> i love this song so much what she saying is so true i reminds me of my ex gurl friend angelica she broke my heart & i miss her so much & still love her & when i saw this video i started 2 cry bc it was so sad i love u angelica nomatter what
<p> i love this song so much..... it reminds me of my ex soul!! he is my 1st love and he is my 1st kiss,,, but we broke each other bcoz of somebody else!! and now both of us had someone new.. but we still communicate each other and were friends now.. but im also his 1st love
<p> I never was a big fan of britney, and though i really liked that song, I never understood its meaning till recently when my boyfriend broke up with me for some other girl. We had been together for 3 years and though we're still madly in love with each other, he just decided to give it all up, even if we had plans together. "And you put a dart through my dreams through my heart and i'm back where i started again, never thought it would end"
<p> you still rock! | Reviewer: tenielle | 10/14/07
