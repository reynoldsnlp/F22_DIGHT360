<p> Let's get out of this country I'll admit I am bored with me I drowned my sorrows and slept around When not in body at least in mind We'll find a cathedral city You can convince me I am pretty
<p> We'll pick berries and recline Let's hit the road dear friend of mine Wave goodbye to our thankless jobs We'll drive for miles maybe never turn off We'll find a cathedral city you can be handsome I'll be pretty
<p> What does this city have to offer me? Everyone else thinks it's the bee's knees What does this city have to offer me? I just can't see I just can't see
<p> Let's get out of this country I have been so unhappy Smell the Jasmine my head was turned I feel like getting confessional We'll find a cathedral city you can convince me I am pretty
<p> What does this city have to offer me? Everyone else thinks it's the bee's knees What does this city have to offer me? I just can't see I just can't see
