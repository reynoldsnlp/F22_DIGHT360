<h> Do you want to do more business?
<p> Very late notice, I know, but my local chapter of BNI is having a Visitor Day this Thursday 22 March. As those who have been to Visitor Days will know, this is not a hard sell to get new members. It really just an opportunity for us to showcase the possible benefits of joining BNI, while at the same time giving you the chance to tell around 50 people about your business. We meet at Fynn Valley Golf Club at Witnesham, 7am sharp. If you would like the chance to tell others about what you do while networking with like minded buisness people, please let me know urgently.

<h> Do not despair!
<p> Alan While visitor days are always a great time to turn up at a BNI meeting, sometimes turning up at a normal meeting is a better idea. I say that because it is less frenetic and you get to see how a normal meeting works. You would be welcome to come along to any meeting on a Thursday morning, just give me a little bit of notice. Just make sure you bring plenty of business cards and a healthy appetite!
