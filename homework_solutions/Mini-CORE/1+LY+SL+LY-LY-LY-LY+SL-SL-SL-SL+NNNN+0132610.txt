<p> so..i broke up with my boyfriend (we've been dating 2 years on and off) and this year I decided to make it official. Our relationship was unstable..it was my fault..he always put up with my s*** and i always left him broken hearted only waiting for him to call me..begging me to get back with him..i was so selfish..
<p> i never really appreciated what he did..
<p> i decided to finally end it for good..and i broke his heart again. and this time he decided he had enough and swore he would never call me again. he was my first love and my first boyfriend..
<p> i regret it..and he dedicated this song to me..i don't know what to do..i miss him.but its for the best..i just hope he doesn't hate me..
