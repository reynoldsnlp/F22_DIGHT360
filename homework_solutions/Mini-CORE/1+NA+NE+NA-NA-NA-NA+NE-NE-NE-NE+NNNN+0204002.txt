<p> Truck manufacturer Navistar was in a Windsor court Wednesday seeking the dismissal of a class action lawsuit filed by workers who didn't receive severance packages when the corporation closed its Chatham plant last year.
<p> "This is another attempt by Navistar to deny our members the benefits that they earned over decades of work at the company," CAW president Ken Lewenza said in a news release. "Every step of the way, Navistar has tried to block handing over what is owed to its former workers -- it is deplorable and should not be allowed to continue."
<p> But, in his submissions to the court, Navistar lawyer John Field argued that the union's legal team is "simply wrong in law" and that the proper route for the parties to follow to settle the dispute is before the Ontario Labour Relations Board.
<p> He said that simply because the two parties attempted to negotiate a close out agreement for two years without success "does not suggest that the courts have any jurisdiction" to intervene. He accused the union of using the court as a pressure tactic to force an agreement.
<p> Using a"Grey Cup" football analogy,  Field said the union cannot play on two or more fields at one time and should stick to the labour board.
<p> "There is only one playing field," he said. "And the statement of claim cannot be paraded out on this playing field.... For all those reasons, it is the position of Navistar, citing leading authorities from the Supreme Court, that this cannot be pursued in this court. We ask you to strike it."
<p> He suggested that the only time a court could intervene in such a dispute would be in the case of the union abandoning its members or a union that has been decertified.
<p> "It is a slippery slope for the courts to weigh in and determine whether the OLRB has the power to (grant) effective relief," he said, pointing out the union continues to represent the interests of the former employees. "That's not the court's task. Don't go down that route."
<p> But the CAW maintains  the court does have the jurisdiction to hear the class action suit.
<p> "This is not about bargaining," said CAW lawyer Lewis Gottheil, in an interview outside the courthouse. "This is about enforcing the rights of the employees and the place to enforce those rights is in court."
<p> However the union's lawyers will have to wait to make their argument. The case has been adjourned until Nov. 21 or 22, depending on court availability in Chatham.
<p> Gottheil said he expects the class action lawsuit to apply to "several hundred" of the nearly 1,200 employees, in production and office units represented by the CAW,  who lost their jobs when the plant finally folded in August 2011, after nearly two years of standing idle.  Gottheil said the plaintiffs have received no severance in the years since the closure.
<p> He said that the law does recognize workers relationship with a former employer and their rights once a collective agreement has expired. One of those rights, he stressed,  is the entitlement to severance pay. While he could not cite an exact figure Gottheil said "millions of dollars" are at stake.
<p> Jim Mitchell, a CAW representative, said the workers are angered by the lack of a deal and are seeking redress under the law.
<p> "We're open to negotiation," he said.  "But Navistar has not paid decades worth of severance for workers. They're frustrated."
<p> One of the former workers attending the proceedings expressed that frustration.
<p> "When I first started with the International I thought it was the best company in the world," said the woman, who declined to give her name. "But I didn't. I just worked with the best people and I miss it every day. It's just sad."
<p> She added she was one of the lucky ones. She was able to turn a part-time job as a hospital worker into a full-time position when the line shut down. Others were not as lucky and continue to search for work.
