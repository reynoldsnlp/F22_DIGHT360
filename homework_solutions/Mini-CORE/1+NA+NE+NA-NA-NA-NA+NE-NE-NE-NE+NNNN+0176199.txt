<h> Deep Panuke project hits another delay
<p> The Deep Panuke project has been delayed because the gas field's offshore platform won't be ready until some time during the first half of 2013. (File)
<p> UPDATED 7:39 p.m. Thursday
<p> Another delay has hit the Deep Panuke natural gas project.
<p> SBM Offshore, the owner-operator of the gas field's offshore platform, said Thursday the structure won't be ready until sometime during the first half of next year.
<p> "We encountered some rework during the commissioning stage of this project," Bruno Chabas, the company's chief executive officer, said during a conference call with financial analysts.
<p> "This rework is on the critical path and is postponing the startup phase of the platform."
<p> The Monaco-based company said the concern is about "process equipment" that needs to be repaired and retested.
<p> Chabas called the delay "disappointing" but said the additional work won't have a major impact on the project's cost.
<p> Deep Panuke had been expected to begin production two years ago but has encountered several days.
<p> Encana Corp . , which owns Deep Panuke, said this fall that production would start by the end of the year.
<p> "We want to get to first gas as well, but we need to do that safely," Lori MacLean, a Encana spokeswoman in Halifax, said Thursday.
<p> "The main thing is to move things forward, and we're doing that by continuing to work with SBM."
<p> She declined to comment on the type of repairs the platform's owner-operator would be making on the structure, located about 250 kilometres southwest of Halifax.
<p> When pressed by analysts, Chabas would only say the systems in question had been tested previously, so damage may have occurred during the platform's two-month sea journey from the United Arab Emirates last year.
<p> The problem may also have been missing during earlier testing at the company's facility in Abu Dhabi, where the structure was built, he said.
<p> Deep Panuke, which includes four deepsea wells, will be capable of producing 300 million cubic feet daily.
<p> The $960-million project has led to a legal battle between Encana and SBM related to cost overruns and delays with the platform.
<p> Alex Brooks, an analyst with Credit Suisse, called the need for repairs "rather alarming" and asked whether the problem is related to structural issues with an offshore oil platform in Norway.
<p> In July, Talisman Energy of Calgary evacuated 140 workers from a North Sea structure SBM constructed.
<p> The Monaco-based firm announced last month that it and Talisman had a plan to repair the grouting on the platform legs of the Yme project.
<p> Chabas responded to Brooks's question by saying: "The nature of the two issues are dissimilar."
<p> MacLean said the Deep Panuke platform is designed specifically for offshore Nova Scotia, inspected regularly by Encana and monitored by the industry regulator, the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board.
<p> "No signs of any concerns have been identified."
<p> Phil Skolnick, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said the delay has pros and cons for the Calgary energy company.
<p> "The way the contract is written, Encana does not have to start paying their lease on that platform until it starts producing," Skolnick said in an interview from New York City.
<p> "But the bad side of it is that as production assets continue to get delayed for a company, that has a bit of a funding gap next year.
<p> It's not a traumatic cash flow out, but it's an asset that they need."
<p> The platform's owner-operator said the delay is having an impact on its bottom line.
<p> SBM, in releasing its third-quarter results, said it won't meet its 2012 revenue target of US$4 billion.
<p> The company didn't say what the shortfall is expected to be but said Deep Panuke delays are one of the main reasons for it.
<p> The drawn-out startup date could also wind up costing provincial electricity customers.
<p> Nova Scotia Power said earlier this week that its fuel costs have risen by $16.7 million this year, mainly because of gas supply delays and interruptions.
<p> The utility said in a regulatory filing it has had to secure other sources of fuel to replace contracted gas.
