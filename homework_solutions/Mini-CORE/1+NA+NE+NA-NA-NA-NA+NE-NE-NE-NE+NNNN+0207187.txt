<p> So Wednesday is the new Sunday: the make-or-break European summit scheduled for today will spill over into next week, with Wednesday now mooted as the final, final deadline for reaching an agreement.
<p> Certainly, Merkel, Sarkozy and the rest won't want to face their exasperated counterparts from the US, China and Japan at the G20 meeting in Cannes in 12 days' time without being able to show that they have heeded the world's pleas for them to get their act together and, as US treasury secretary Tim Geithner put it, "take the threat of cascading default, bank runs and catastrophic risk off the table".
<p> If they can overcome their differences, the final "comprehensive" package looks likely to have the three elements demanded by financial markets and by Geithner: a substantial debt writedown for Greece 's private sector investors, many of them French and German banks; a recapitalisation of the banking sector to patch up the hole blown by the crisis; and a beefed-up European financial stability facility, the so-called "big bazooka".
<p> That should buy some time, helping to prevent a Greek partial default setting off a domino effect in the world's financial markets that could bring Italy, Spain and even France crashing down.
<p> The writedown on privately held Greek bonds, if it's large enough and successfully executed, could also mark a small step towards long-term debt sustainability for the Greeks, by finally reducing the total amount they owe. The 21% "haircut" proposed in the last emergency rescue deal, in July, was almost immediately deemed too small.
<p> Yet even if the French and Germans can do a deal and bring their eurozone colleagues along with them, there remains a deep hole in the logic driving the entire round of frantic negotiations. The EFSF -- the big bazooka -- is aimed at protecting embattled countries during temporary crises by buying up their bonds when the markets have driven up interest rates to eye-watering levels.
<p> But that does nothing to reduce the overall level of borrowing: the debt burden of the countries that are forced into the EFSF's hands will continue to rise. That will make it all the more important that the affected countries -- Portugal, and possibly Spain and Italy -- are able to grow their way out of trouble; but that seems increasingly impossible in the current climate.
<p> Economic growth is the missing piece of the euro jigsaw. There is nothing in the plan being thrashed out in Brussels that can prevent the eurozone sliding into the double-dip recession that now looks all but inevitable, or help the hardest-hit countries to expand again. The only answer being articulated is German-style austerity: and that recipe hasn't worked well so far.
<p> While the diplomatic face-off between Paris and Berlin was going on last week, a stunning fact emerged about the country at the centre of the crisis. According to Brussels, the ECB and the IMF, it is now expected that the Greek economy will have contracted by 15% between the onset of the crisis and the end of next year.
<p> That's not a recession: it's economic Armageddon. Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio is now expected to balloon to 181%, against the 161% predicted in July: in other words, the problem the drastic spending cuts were meant to solve has got far worse, not better.
<p> Unemployment is at 16.5%; businesses are failing; civil servants have faced deep pay cuts; public services are being slashed. Far from being "rescued" or "bailed out" by its eurozone neighbours, Greece has been plunged ever deeper into the worst economic crisis in living memory, and it should be no surprise that protesters have taken to the streets.
<p> Helping recession-gripped countries to borrow more, as the EFSF will do, is essential to preventing them sliding into bankruptcy, but it does nothing to solve the underlying problem -- and nothing to tackle the diverging fortunes of the 17 economies within the single currency zone, which are stretching it to breaking point.
<p> A substantial write-off of Greece's debts, as envisaged under the deal being hammered out in Brussels, will help if it comes off; but the advice to almost any other country in such a deep rut -- saddled with uncompetitive firms and a creaking tax system, and trapped in recession -- would be a sharp devaluation to buy some competitiveness and hopefully kickstart growth.
<p> Without such a devaluation, Greece will need substantial economic aid -- not yet more loans -- to rebuild its shattered economy, and there's little sign of that materialising.
<p> It would help if Greece's major export markets weren't all on their own self-imposed austerity drive at the same time; but France, Italy and Spain all announced new cutbacks over the summer to satisfy the bond markets' demands for fiscal self-flagellation.
<p> At each cuts announcement, the experts marked down that country's growth forecasts. Many are now expecting the entire eurozone economy to contract in the fourth quarter of the year. There is a clear risk that forcing the banks to recapitalise could exacerbate the situation yet further, by depressing lending.
<p> Sir Mervyn King stressed in his speech in Liverpool last week that the crisis facing the single currency has never been about liquidity -- a short-term cash flow problem. Instead, it's about solvency, and it runs much wider than Greece.
<p> The draft agreement that was circulating last week included an insistence that Greece's situation was unique, and that no other euro member would be allowed to follow it into default. But few expect Greece to be the last; and as its experience shows, being "bailed out" by the eurozone can be economically and politically devastating.
<p> Erik Britten of Fathom Consulting puts it this way: "The term bailout is used in a number of ways. One of them is allowing a country to finance their deficits without borrowing from the markets, and their debt-to-GDP ratio continues to go up. The other kind of bailout is one that says 'we accept that we have lost the money that we lent you: we're writing off that debt'."
<p> That's what campaigners against the insufferable burden of developing country debt used to call a "jubilee" -- but it's not exactly what Angela Merkel has in mind.
<p> Germany, which will ultimately pick up the tab, is understandably determined that there must be a heavy price attached to fiscal failure. But Greece's plight reveals the catastrophic consequences of tackling a debt crisis by handing out more loans while systematically slashing away at the economy's productive potential.
<p> More conspiracy-minded analysts of the machinations in Brussels believe that Sarkozy and Merkel are merely hoping to paper over the cracks until 2013, when the permanent European stability mechanism comes into force. That will bring with it a formal process for sovereign debt default and, potentially, for punishing countries that break the rules, perhaps by forcing them to leave -- "the big red ejector button" as one eurosceptic City veteran called it last week.
<p> At that point, Greece, and any other countries still failing to make the grade, could be elbowed out, leaving a smaller "hard euro" area centred on Germany.
<p> That may be much too cynical; but there's a serious risk that the current approach, bazookas and all, locks Europe into decline. No wonder battle-scarred Tokyo executives, watching the unfolding crisis from afar, told my colleague Dan Milmo last week that Europe may be condemning itself to a Japanese-style "lost decade".
<h> Comments
<p> This is not to minimize the difficulties the Greeks are in (and I can't tell you how much I sympathize with their people) but didn't Chile suffer two 15% or so declines under the tutelage of the Chicago Boys during Pinochet's regime? Isn't it time to bite the bullet and wipe the debt slate clean? Especially when as a planet we have energy issues and climate change coming down the track (and now perhaps a much larger world population)?
<p> Without the austerity measures, and I agree they will have a big negative impact on growth, then there will be no bailout at all for Greece. Exactly what do you think the growth figures will be like under that scenario.
<p> The Greeks as a whole have to accept that they took good money from europe and badly misused it. Of course in these situations it is usually the case that the majority of people did little wrong and a significant minority raked it in without giving a shit about the consequences or what was right and wrong. It is probably the case that the innocent will get shafted far more than the guilty (as has happened in the casino banking system where the bonuses still flow freely despite the despair of the masses). But the bottom line for Greece is that they should accept their fate and get on with trying to rebuild their economy as best they can rather than go on strike and riot. There is an alternative to the austerity measures, but the ordinary greeks will not be better off going down that route. I am sorry, but that is just the way it is.
<p> The EU is bailing water out of the greek boat which is sinking. But more water is entering than can be bailed out. Greece has to default so that it can leave the Eurozone and therefore strenghten the Eurozone.
<p> "Austerity" - massive spending cuts in a recession - is a ridiculous policy. It is guaranteed to fail, no matter where it is tried. It is based on the self-evidently absurd idea that one can starve oneself into health, that the royal road to prosperity is to make everyone poor.
<p> There are obvious steps that could be taken that would resolve this trumped up "crisis" once and for all. Let's face it, if Germany, alone, were to simply assume all of Greece's public debt, that would only raise its indebtedness from 44 to 58% of GDP, still well below the levels in most OECD countries, including the US, UK and France. And the point of saying that is that doing anything of the sort is far in excess of what is required.
<p> There is a massive attack underway on all the peoples of Europe and their inconvenient penchant for social democracy. This attack is being led, in substantial part, by the governments of Europe. Greece is being made an example for all Europeans. That calls not for smug or pitying dismissal, but for solidarity and revolt. Ask not for whom the oligarchs toll, they toll for thee.
<p> This article goes so far into optimism that it enters the realm of fantasy.
<p> ....hopefully kickstart growth.... forsooth.
<p> That 'lost decade' for Japan is just the starting one of an unending progression, and will be replicated in all the industrialised countries.
<p> As I have just posted on the William Keegan thread:
<p> If by 'economy' you mean 'rampant consumerism and GDP-as-we-have-pursued-it', that 'economy' was inevitably tipping into a downward spiral anyway. The resources to sustain it are not coming to hand as easily as hitherto.
<p> But, properly faced up to, that is no bad thing.
<p> There are many feasible scenarios ('alternative futures') that can be depicted in which Quality of Life increases within the resources available.
<p> Unfortunately, there is a lack of leadership in doing that 'facing up to'. Politicians work to such a short time scale that they are incapable of looking at the long-term picture, and academics work in such narrow specialisms that they have no breadth of vision.
<p> There'll come a time, a century or two hence, when the History teachers show the video that we left behind us and explain that for about 300 to 350 years there were abundant supplies of coal, oil, and natural gas being collected from within Earth and those who were in a position to put them to use had a beano.
<p> They will also tell of the later development of Moral Economy, when strategies to cope with exitting from industrialism/capitalism/consumerism were having to be developed.
<p> Some of the video from some places during that transition time may well be quite unpleasant, but regions of the world that still have an agrarian base may make the transition peaceably and pleasantly.
<p> What a poorly informed article by Heather Stewart. Even if 100% of Greece's debts are forgiven Greece remains a country of tax evaders and corruption. Its civil service truly is bloated and needs a 50% haircut. 20% of the work force are migrants from other countries who work harder and for less than do Greeks and inevitably in the black economy. The government is wracked by clientelism and croanyism. Scandalously the political parties award themselves _10 from the public purse for each vote they get. A woman who has had four children gets an extra pension -- even if her children have sensibly departed to live in other countries decades ago. The pension system is politicized, corrupt and doesn't work. With the pervasiveness of fraud in Greece the EU agriculture subsidy system it is little wonder no one wants a land registry in Greece because of the transparency it would bring to fraud that is being perpetuated (alas not restricted to Greece in this EU regard). Don't even ask who is the largest land owner in Greece.
<p> For sure Greece needs a new start but this reform must start with restructuring its systems of governance starting with the lack of accountability on the part of those 'elected' to vote. Greece's fourth largest city of 290 000 people has 41 city councillors plus eight deputy mayors plus a mayor all jammed around the public trough. None have accountability to any particular area of the city which could explain why the city is so squalid. Private payments (yes, bribes) are often necessary to get action from those marching up and down the streets protesting about losing their jobs (= publically-paid welfare positions), i.e. to get them to do the job. Obtaining police action on private property matters first requires an official payment of _100 -- i.e. justice only for the wealthy. These are the scandals of Greece. Alas, this all seems to be unknown or forgotten during this economic crisis.
<p> Austerity is a rapidly failing policy which as the article describes is destroying what is left of the real Greek Economy. The black market and the Tax fiddles will no doubt be continuing unabated,but you can't run a country like that. What ever deal comes out of the panic meetings the Debt will have to be written off not rescheduled traded or passed onto a later date. The Euro is to simplistic a guilty party universally hated by the markets 27 less currencies to wheel and deal in. The blame lies fully on the unrealistic expectations generated by traders in Toxic debt and until there is regulation to stop these fairy tale returns the problem and all of the Debt is going to continue to encourage more austerity through out the world
<p> Yes, yes... we all understand the issue. There is a cash-flow crisis in Greece... the government can't get credit to buy the green ink to print the tax demands to raise the money to...
<p> Greece is locked into a debt death-spiral. If it is continues its present course of (in)action then it will become a long-term basket case, consigned to dependency on handouts from Frankfurt.
<p> A centralized European finance ministry would make this possible. Greece could become a small peripheral region with endemic high unemployment and no industry, scraping by on cash injections from the solvent north.
<p> Or Greece can default, leave the euro and start again with a new, devalued drachma. The immediate effect would be awful, but eventually - as always happens after default - the situation will stabilize and Greek manufacturing will be competitive by virtue of being cheap.
<p> It really is that simple. But of course the sane option won't be taken. Because the EU elite has decided that they'd rather have Greece on perpetual financial life-support than allow it to leave the Euro.
<p> Strange how most of those posting comments (and belatedly journalists) have always said that these cuts would destroy the economy of Greece, while politicians, economists, and experts still seem quite unaware of this obvious result.
<p> The fact is, of course, that they are not unaware. They knew all along. They are quite happy to see whole countries bankrupted, in order to protect their national interest. So much for the United States of Europe.
<p> With all due respect Heather I have been arguing that Greece has moved from recession to depression for a while now. Two months ago now I pointed this out.
<p> The Greek economy is now in a depression
<p> Back on August 12th I pointed out some rather inconvenient facts for the EU/ECB/IMF troika mantra that the Greek bail out is going well.
<p> Available non-seasonally-adjusted data indicate that, in the 2nd quarter of 2011, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices of year 2000 decreased by 6.9 % in comparison with the 2nd quarter of 2010.
<p> industrial production posted a year on year decline of 13.1% in June compared to a year on year decline of 10% in May. If we look at the volume index of retail sales to see real rather then nominal changes we see that a year on year fall of 8.8% in April increased to a fall of 10.9% in May.
<p> To these numbers was added an unemployment rate which has risen to 16.6% and a continued deterioration in Greece's state budget figures. No amount of revision of the targets could hide the truth from those willing to compare the outcome to the end of July 2011 to the same period in 2010 which shows a rise of just under 25%.
<p> I'm not sure whatt his article is trying to say - that Greece could get by without cutting its budget through austerity measures? The damage to Greece was done way before the last couple of years. Greece's over-borrowing was always going to cause a disaster.
<p> Greece should have defaulted and exited the Euro sometime ago however painful that would have been - and it would have certainly led to economic regreesion in the short-term, but the accompanying fall in drachma value would have begun to correct the contraction (though people would still be much worse off).
<p> If people are trying to pin the blame on austerity measures alone they are woefully, woefully mistaken. Europe and the UK in particular is going to have to get used to a drop in living standards certainly in the short-term no matter what kind of escapologist actions we contrive to use............Get used to it.
<p> What nonsense! Totally logical failure. WITHOUT the bailout credits, the austerity would have been ever harsher! What do you expect, really, that the taxpayers of other EU nations subsidize the Greek lifestyle that created the whole mess, without demanding any changes? Simply "more of the same"?
<p> If you have any better ideas than the current reforms, pls explain them here! But simply opposing the changes, without offering any reasonable alternatives, is irresponsible.
<p> Greece leaving the Eurozone ain't a painless reform, either. The devaluation of the currency would hit the low and medium incomes the hardest! And this wouldn't be a magic wand to revive the economy, either, since Greece's problems are structural. It's NOT simply the Euro. Read this McKinsey report fro details: http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/CNBC/Section\\...
<p> "They knew all along." To a degree, yes, brunheiras. But the problem is, WHAT is the alternative? To drop even more money into this failed nation, without demanding any serious changes to the system? Come on! Also, the reforms could have produced much better results if not for the unions actively sabotaging them and harming the economny even more with all those strikes. EU/IMF expected more responsibility.
<p> "They are quite happy to see whole countries bankrupted" Oh, come on, this doesn't make any sense! NOBODY is happy about this desaster costing hundreds of billions of Euros. That's obvious.
<p> For 'rugbyprof' re 11:27AM: Austerity is here to stay for the foreseeable future.
<p> Yes. Why isn't that being generally accepted, faced up to, and got on with?
<p> The levels of austerity required are nowhere near as onerous as the ones that we accepted in Britain in the decade after WWII, whilst we worked our way up to 'never having had it so good' after being skint and deeply in debt to the Yanks at the end of hostilities.
<p> I had my late boyhood, teens and early adulthood in that decade and life wasn't bad at all. Yes, it was 'austere' by today's standards; but there was a general air of confidence that the quality of life could be improved even if the material side if it was a bit lacking.
<p> My guess is that there is now an underlying sense that we are in the process of being bereaved of the materialism that we have become addicted to (and led into by endless advertisements). Often the early times following bereavement contain spells of great unjustified anger, which may be at the root of some of the riots that are blowing up.
<p> Subsequently, there may come depression, before acceptance and coming to terms with the new situation.
<p> I am hopeful that today's kids will leave the depression part to the older generations and get on with living thriftily, frugally, and within their means.
<p> Try this. You tell your bank like I'm in hock for 4400 zillion squigglies but I'm really really gonna pay that off really soon now. Thing is though, I'm in a sticky situation right now so I'm just gonna hafta borrow another 1400zillion squigglies to square-y it all so I can then pay off the whole 5,800 zillion squigglies ASAP! Hey Mister Bank Manager thats kool aint it???
<p> For 'rugbyprof' re 12:24PM: It would seem 'resilience' has been weakened
<p> You have 'hit a nail on the head' there. The concept of 'resilience' does need to make a comeback, as an antidote to the brittleness of the advancement of complexity that Tainter describes as having so often been at the root of The Collapse of Complex Societies.
<p> The word 'resilience' does seem to have begun appearing in the writings of those social scientists (economic anthropologists and so forth) who look at economies other than the highly-industrialised ones.
<p> I am so old that I was born into an extended family in a peri-urban village between Bradford and Leeds which valued their economic resilience to the extent of cosseting it, though they called it 'security', and described it as 'having something to fall back on'.
<p> Hence my continual 'banging on the drum' which advocates the morphing of urban Golf Clubs into Allotment Associations. Behind the row of ex-weavers'-cottages in which the extended family lived, there was The Field. It was less than a couple of acres, but had all sorts of 'projects' in it from vegetable gardens and beehives through to pigeon lofts and a workshop in which I remember three scrap Austin Sevens being profitably cannibalised into two runners. Any member of the family who was on short-time at the mill could pull their weight Up The Field.
<p> My grandparents even disapproved of 'saddling yourself with the debt' of a house mortgage. They advocated saving-up till you could buy 'a little place' outright, and then saving-up again till you could buy your way up to the next step on the housing ladder.
<p> I now live among peri-urban para-peasants again, out here in the Middle Mekong region of Isaan and Laos. They have a very resilient economy that I wrote about yesterday on the thread about flooding down in Bangkok.
<p> What were 'the rural poor' would now be better described as 'the peri-urban secure'.
<p> In fact, they may well come to be envied by residents in 'high-GDP' welfare states.
<p> There are several ways in which 'urbanity' has come to the villages.
<p> Adults returning from working in Greater Bangkok, and in countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, the Gulf States and Israel have 'cosmopolitanised' the villages.
<p> Paved roads now allow for youngsters to ride their motorbikes to the highway and then go to university on the bus, and so on.
<p> The villagers still have the robust social security system of the extended family in the village, with reciprocity and redistribution in their economic system alongside marketry.
<p> They own their own houses on their own land, with no rent or mortgage payment to find each month-----so 100% housing security.
<p> It is usual to keep a good reserve (often enough for three years consumption) of rice in their household granaries-----so 100% food security.
<p> They keep their savings in gold.
<p> And, finally, they work for themselves and so have 100% job security, since no boss ever sacked himself!
<p> Over this century, as industrialism/capitalism/consumerism contract to being a less rampant component in 'Quality of Life', there'll be much to be emulated in their lifestyle.
<p> It is the fact that their is still a lot of this style of agrarian resilience-----with, at base, a Moral Economy, rather than just The Market-----still extant in the world that gives me optimism that many regions will avoid the travails of the cul-de-sac of depending on a dwindling supply of material resources that the 'developed' nations have got themselves into.
<p> (And for which there is no excuse------- Limits to Growth has been on their bookshelves since 1972 and even the students on the ultimate Mickey Mouse degree of PPE at Oxford would have been made aware of it, I expect.)
<p> Yes because if they spend more that should result in double digit growth which will have a multiplier effect and things will all be great.
<p> Back in the real World.....
<p> The Greeks have been living on planet dodo for a long time and the day of reckoning has had to come and the jammy sods look like putting their burden onto others. It just isn't fair, just like the greedy bankers who got bailed out by socialist Gov's.
<p> "Let's face it, if Germany, alone, were to simply assume all of Greece's public debt, that would only raise its indebtedness from 44 to 58% of GDP" This is utter nonsense! Germany's public debt is at about 80% GDP already and can easily jump over the risky 100% line with all the bailout measures in tbhe pipeline. Our economy is cooling down now, too. We should rather use money for our own stimulus than waste it on the black hole Greece.
<p> The Greeks have been living on planet dodo for a long time and the day of reckoning has had to come and the jammy sods look like putting their burden onto others
<p> We've all been living on planet dodo for a long time. The Greek day of reckoning just happens to have come first because it was the weakest in a stampeding herd and got picked off first. Your day will come.
<p> And ordinary Greek people are not 'jammy sods'. And we have not passed the burden to others. The burden has been passed to us. We have one of the lowest levels of private debt in Europe. The vast majority of us pay our taxes and our national insurance contributions in good faith. We work a full 40 hour week 7-3, 5 days a week. The average retirement age is 60 for women and 65 for men. Some get to retire earlier (but they do in Britain too, don't they?) And of course, the rich don't pay their fair share of taxes (sound familiar?).
<p> The Greek 1% is buying up London properties as we speak with the money they got out of the country but the savings of the 99% have gone. Where are they? Who's got them? What have WE done to deserve this punishment?
<p> The fundamental problem with Greece is: There is no real industry, their whole wealth was build on debt. So even if we cut their debt in half the fundamental problem remains: Maintaining living standards on the current industrial base is not possible for Greece. So they remain dependent on the rest of Europe to pay.
<p> Why oh why does the mention of the word Greece in a Guardian article result in an outbreak of general xenophobia in the CiF section?
<p> I was particularly amused by
<p> @TFDS
<p> Its civil service truly is bloated and needs a 50% haircut.
<p> Greece in fact has one of the lowest rates of public employment in the OECD. 7.9% of it's workforce are employed in the public sector, as opposed to a 15% average. (UK by comparison employs around 20% in the public sector)
<p> Prior to the recession public spending accounted for around 45%-47% of GDP (on a par with Germany and the UK), and now stands at about 53% of GDP (what is the UK's I wonder?) Debt has soared from 95% of GDP in 2007 to an estimated 152% of GDP in 2011. The deficit went from just over 3% in 2007 to 15.4% in 2009.
<p> The reason this happened is because Greece experienced a fall in tax receipts, and a rise Government expenditure. This is what happens in a recession. Greece also has higher than average spending on social protection than other OECD countries.
<p> The austerity measures forced upon Greece have ironically made the risk of default much more likely rather than less likely.
<p> Fiscal contraction while it has halved the deficit, has caused growth to collapse - this year growth is forecast to be around -4.0%. Negative growth increases the debt burden, making it more and more unsustainable. Even if the deficit was zero, Greece would be in very serious difficulty.
<p> Unemployment is at 16.5%; businesses are failing; civil servants have faced deep pay cuts; public services are being slashed. Far from being "rescued" or "bailed out" by its Eurozone neighbours, Greece has been plunged ever deeper into the worst economic crisis in living memory, and it should be no surprise that protesters have taken to the streets
<p> Well, far from being forced down its throat, it was Greece who insisted to be bailed out. It needed (and still needs) this money for paying the salaries of its civil servants (and the lavish pensions). Greece still has the option to refuse the EU money, something that she obviously won't. The price for accepting this bail out money is being paid by the Greek commoners, like this Onassis heiress who now lives off refuse bins. In a way, it is the humble Greeks who are being forced to pay the price for the greediness and the insolence of their own Greek brethren (like parasitical civil servants and farmers living off EU subsidies) who ultimately lived beyond their means for the last two decades or so. The party is over now and the ensuing hangover really no-one's fault other that the party goers' own.
<p> @HugsAndPuppies. My dear, aren't we living in a fantasy world. The US and UK as corrupt as Greece? Sorry, but Yanks and Brits pay their taxes in much greater numbers than the Greeks do; many fewer government jobs in America and Britain are received through nepotism; and when you enter a little shop in Louisville or Leeds, rare is the clerk who wants you to pay "without a receipt" as they would in Thessaloniki. The Guardian's special articles on Greece (and Der Spiegel's and El Pais' and The New York Times') have covered this in detail. Guess you weren't there to read them.
<p> Maintaining living standards on the current industrial base is not possible for Greece
<p> .
<p> @bismarx This is true if we're talking about the current industrial base as defined by the 'hard-core' European countries.
<p> This is part of the problem though. Greece and the other periphery countries will never have the same industrial base as Northern Europe because historically the development of these economies has been entirely different. Actually, Greece did have a lot more industry (for example sugar refineries) before the EU put a stop it and flooded the market with other products.
<p> Well the Austerians have taken charge in Europe, led by Germany. They think you can get growth by shrinking an economy. Since this is beyond stupid, the result will be a disaster. The Euro will ultimately have to go. It is acting like the gold standard did in the 1930s to prevent any sensible solution to the problem. Most nations in Europe need to devalue but they can't do that with the Euro. So the agony goes on and on and on, while Merkel dithers and procrastinates. Greece will never recover without something like a 100% repudiation of its debts. And so far they are only talking about 50%. Nowhere near enough.
<p> I hardly think tourism and agriculture can be the sole base for the wealth of a whole major nation. Agricultures boom is - as everywhere in europe - build on the giant subsidies provided by the EU (50% of EU-budget is spend on agriculture).
<p> Other than that, even if Greece did have a "sugar industry", 30 years ago their living standard still was way lower than today and said industry does not exist any more as you say.
<p> For all those who pretend that the major problem isn't Greece, but the other EU nations, read this and weep: http://greekeconomistsforreform.com/publ\\...
<p> Those Greek experts hit all the nails! They identified the major problems and developed ideas for dealing with them. That's an impressive effort at creating reasonable reform proposals to adress the roadblocks that prevent a recovery in Greece now. If this gains traction and eventually becomes reality, there would finally be a chance for a better future for that nation.
<p> We don't think that at all. But we simply can't afford to pay for a huge job program that won't be sustainable at all because of Greece not having done its reform homework yet. There can be only help for those who are willing to help themselves. And any plans that are based on Germany paying even more money in support fo Greece are delusional. Less wishful thinking, less misguided protests, more initiative to engage the every real problems of the nation! See the white paper linked in the previous comment for details.
