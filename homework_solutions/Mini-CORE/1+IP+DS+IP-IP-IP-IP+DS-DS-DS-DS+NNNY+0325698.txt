<p> Norman "Jack-of-All-Genres" Cook, in addition to his former occupations as bassist for the Housemartins and one-third of acid house hitmakers Pizzaman, is also the man behind one of the most popular of the new flock of English "Brit-hop" producers, Fatboy Slim. Releasing his Fatboy material through club staple Skint, Cook's raucous blend of house, acid, funk, hip-hop, electro, and techno has added... Read more in Amazon's Fatboy Slim Store

<p> Finally, the U.S. sees a domestic release of Fatboy Slim's On the Floor at the Boutique , hands down one of the most thrilling, addictive DJ mix albums ever released. Recorded live in 1998 at the Big Beat Boutique (epicenter of the mid- to late-'90s big-beat movement), Norman Cook, a.k.a. Fatboy Slim, takes the listener on a fascinating, diverse tour of four-on-the-floor sounds. What's always made Cook so great is the way that he seamlessly blends seemingly incongruous sounds to create righteously cool, shiny new beats; he truly is the trainspotting vinyl freak with an uncanny talent for creating accessible dance-floor shakers built of weird components. Take track 4--who'd have thought a spry blue-beat ska sample, an ELO riff, phat beats, a few stray horn riffs, and a sped-up Jungle Brothers vocal track would be one of the coolest things heard all year? --Mike McGonigal
<h> Product Description
<p> Continuous Mix By Fatboy Slim. Mixes In Old-School & New Material (even By Fatboy Slim Himself) --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
<p> I was SO surprised to find out that big Mr. Fatboy hasn't lost his roots. This is a fantastic album that highlights the best in bigbeat and Big Norman mixes it all so well. I know alot of the kids out there who love Fatboy Slim for Praise You and "The Funk Soul Brother" have bought this CD and hated it, and they deserve it. This is what true bigbeat is all about and for some it may take a little getting used to, but in the end it's worth it. Notable tracks by the Bassbin Twins, Cut La Roc, Jungle Brothers (my all-time fav FBS remix), and DJ Tonka. I promise you that if you play this album at a party, everyone will have 4.592 times as much fun (that's a proven statistic.)
<p> Fatboy Slim, it seems you either love him for bringing happy bounce music to the masses or loathe him for dragging the big beat genre into insipidness. Personally I'm in the middle, finding his "Better Living Through Chemistry" a well-done effort and his "You've Come A Long Way, Baby" a dumbed down mess.
<p> Well this mixed set of selected tunes is neither, residing in a happy middle ground. Fatboy drops inspired choices like the often sampled "Apache", the Jungle Brothers' "Because I got it like that"- with a great ELO sample in it, and a few of his own, "Michael Jackson" and "Rockafeller Skank." He generally picks fun quality songs with a hip-hop flavor to them, making this disc a parallel to the Chemical Brothers "Live at the Heavenly Social" mix disc of years back.
<p> 70 minutes of this can wear thin at times, and his apparent love of squeally acid tunes which he drops 2/3 the way in won't work for everyone. Still, in the right doses it makes for a good party on a platter.
<p> This latest US release from Fatboy Slim, a.k.a Norman Cook is truly an amazing piece of art. First off, the entire CD is a non-stop mix, making it great for a party, and showcasing Fatboy's talent for seamlessly mixing tracks. Second, the music is classic. There isn't a single track that isn't worth listening to, and the variety is nice. It really is a must have CD if you like this kind of music. Plus, the enhanced track features a cool video from the Concorde Club, where the disc was made. It's definitely worth just that track alone.
