<h> about
<p> Thinking it was too simple, I carried this song around in my back pocket for a few months before trying it out on my regular "Body Life" audience at Peninsula Bible Church. They loved it and learned it on the spot. It's now my best-known song.
<h> lyrics
<p> Love Him in the morning when you see the sun a-rising Love Him in the evening 'cause He took you through the day And in the in-between-time when you feel the pressure coming Remember that He loves you and He promises to stay
<p> When you think you've got to worry 'Cause it seems the thing to do Remember He ain't in a hurry He's always got time for you
<p> So... Love Him in the morning when you see the sun a-rising Love Him in the evening 'cause He took you through the day And in the in-between-time when you feel the pressure coming Remember that He loves you and He promises to stay
