<h> Jay-Z Orders Rihanna: 'Go To Rehab Or You Are Dropped From The Label'
<p> Those close to Rihanna have been worrying about the star's out of control partying for months but it seems the 'We Found Love' star missing a flight back to the US after a night out in London was the final straw for mentor Jay-Z who has ordered the singer to get to rehab.
<p> The 24 year-old hardly seems to miss a night out and has been frequently seen partying around the globe, visiting strip clubs and even hospitalised for exhaustion as well as her intense workload. But now Jay-Z has warned the 'Rude Boy' star that he will drop her if she doesn't get help.
<p> "Rihanna has been out of control for months. She was supposed to catch a flight back to the UK last week, but she ended up missing it, which was the final straw for management," a source told Closer Magazine.
<p> "Jay-Z hit the roof when he found out, and told Rihanna, 'Go to rehab now or I'll drop you from the label.' She's not happy, but she now feels she has no choice."
<p> "She's reached breaking point. Ri says she's physically and mentally exhausted and feeling lost. I think she desperately needs help and some time off - not just from work but from all the other stresses in her life too," the source added.
<p> The stress and upset over her Grandmother's cancer battle is also said to be putting a strain on the young singer.
