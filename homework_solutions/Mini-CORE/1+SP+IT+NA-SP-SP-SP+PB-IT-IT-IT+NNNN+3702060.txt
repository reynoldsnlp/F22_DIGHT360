<h> News from Maggie Seed about Easy Reads
<p> I asked Maggie Seed some questions about the changes to the pocket novels and she has kindly allowed me to share her answers here. These are the questions I asked:
<p> Caress: Can we assume this is very similar to the current pocket novels? Gentle romances with a closed door policy on romantic antics and with a Happy Ever After?
<p> Liaison: Just how 'hot' will these be? Are we talking full scale erotica with commensurate adult language (a la Fifty Shades). Or are they more in line with the Mills and Boon 'Modern' romances, with steamy sex scenes that use euphemism?  Or could it be either?  Does there have to be a Happy Ever After for the hero and heroine?
<p> Intrigue: One question I'm being asked is whether this imprint (and the Suspense) will also have a romantic element. Or can we dispense with the romance and just concentrate on the murders/crimes? Is there room for cosy crime? Or are you looking for something darker?
<p> Suspense: Could this include paranormal? And if so, does there have to be a rational explanation as in past pocket novels? Or are we just talking about 'the evil that men do'? (a la Annie Wilkes in Stephen King's Misery or Charles Boyer in Gaslight (swoon)).
<p> And this was Maggie's response:
<p> Yes, I feel that Caress most closely resembles the Pocket Novels, and I hope with our new branding, writers will embrace the lack of boundaries.
<p> Liaison -- not full scale erotica because I think we need a gripping story. However, Fifty Shades does have a redemption-type story going on, as well as all the action.
<p> Intrigue -- there has to be some sort of relationship going on with these, because these books are going to be in amongst women's magazines, but they are suspense and crime novels, so I am open to them either way. It would be good to have one with and one without, so we can see if there is a trend. If I was to look for a parallel, I would suggest NJ Cooper and Sophie Hannah. We are thinking if there is a trend, we can diversify the genres still further. This applies to the paranormal stories too.
<p> I'd asked about a particular type of character I'd like to include (but which I'm selfishly going to keep to myself until I've written it ... sorry!) But this is what Maggie had to say about it:
<p> I am open to as many different ideas and stories are there are potential writers.I do hope this helps, I am so looking forward to lots of lovely novels to read.
<p> So there you have it. I hope that clears up some of the queries about the new Easy Reads. I can assure you that Maggie is very approachable, so if you have an idea you're not sure about, do contact her to ask if it's suitable. I'm sure she'll be glad to advise.
<p> Hi Sally, Sorry for the 2nd query, but I've searched the net and can't find the answer anywhere. Do you know how long MW take to come back to you, and can you do multiple submissions? I don't with short stories, but 50,000 words is quite a lot to have tied up if it takes ages to get it back!
<p> The response time varies, L.O. When you first send them something, it can take up to three months or more for them to respond, but once you're in the system it tends to be quicker.
<p> Regarding multiple submissions, I'd suggest seeing if they like the first thing you send them first, before committing any more work to them. After that you might be okay to send in more than one submission at a time (but do make sure they're in separate emails/envelopes). I'd also suggest (and this is something I've only started doing) writing just 3 chapters and a synopsis and sending them, rather than completing the whole novel. That way you haven't tied up 50k words. Just promise that you can have it turned around very quickly if they want it. But as I say, this is something I've only just started doing. I used to write the whole thing. But I'm more confident about completing a novel now than I was back then.
<p> Sally, Are all the stories for the younger generation or would mine fit in? I love writing about WW2 and I always think my readers are the more mature reader. What do you think? Lovely to see how you've progressed since we first met. Love Maryx
<p> Hello, Mary, lovely to see you! The stories will suit any reader, though I do wonder if your story would be more suited to The People's Friend. They love WW2 stories (Our Day Will Come was set in WW2). But you never know until you try. Why not send the first three chapters and a synopsis to Maggie and see what she says? She's a lovely lady, very approachable and easy to talk to, and she's also very helpful to writers.
<h> Words to Live By...
<p> "If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot...reading is the creative center of a writer's life...you cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you." -- Stephen King
