<p> In June, the Star launched Help Week and received hundreds of requests from readers asking for help from experts. We extended Help Week through the summer, inviting readers to send in their questions or to help others by responding with solutions.
<p> Debbie Lloyd of Brampton wants her daughters, aged 7 and 8, to know the benefits of volunteer work, but can't find an organization that welcomes young children.
<p> Lloyd's question resonated with readers, some with children who had similar frustrations.
<p> Jackson Framst of Guelph wanted to volunteer at his great grandfather's nursing home. He thought as a 10-year-old, he could easily manage to help at Bingo Night. But the minimum age for volunteers at the home is 14. He wrote a letter to the volunteer co-ordinator explaining how he could contribute as a volunteer, but received no reply.
<p> So he started his own organization.
<p> It's called Kids Can Too and connects children aged 8 to 13 with volunteer organizations willing to take them on.
<p> "I believe that if just a few community organizations are willing to give these younger kids the chance, this will encourage others to do this too!" Jackson wrote in letter to a local newspaper. "Kids are members of our communities. We want to take part. We want to contribute. We want to help."
<p> He's now working with Guelph's volunteer centre , which has offered to partner with him and measure the response. His first project was getting kids to join a mass food packaging event at the University of Guelph on Sept. 8.
<p> Reader Elizabeth Owens Jay recalled helping older people in her neighbourhood -- cutting grass, gardening and shovelling snow. It forged deep bonds. The elderly are often overlooked, she noted.
<p> "I learned an enormous amount about gardening from these seniors. They were always outside directing me. It was beneficial to us both."
<p> She and her family now live in the same Mississauga neighbourhood where she grew up and her children, who are 4 and 6, also help out.
<p> "This lays the foundation that helping neighbours is the natural thing to do ... They love having real 'work' to do and feel important when helping out."
<p> Joanne Berrigan, who works at Acclaim Health , an organization that helps seniors, also questioned the need for structured volunteer work.
<p> "My suggestion is that they seek out a lonely, elderly neighbour and offer to help tidy their yard, get groceries or invite them over for tea for some social time and listen to them. This is what is truly needed by the seniors that I help in our community."
<p> Lloyd was interested in reader Karen Richard's suggestion she check out Holiday Helpers -- an organization that welcomes families to assemble and wrap gift boxes for those in need. Younger children can illustrate cards to go with the gifts. "That's something they would really enjoy doing," says Lloyd.
