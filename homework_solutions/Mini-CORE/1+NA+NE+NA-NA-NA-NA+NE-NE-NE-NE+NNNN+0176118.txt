<h> Adele Steps Out in Public for the First Time Since Giving Birth
<p> The sultry-voiced singer went out for a walk Tuesday evening in London with beau Simon Konecki -- the first time Adele has stepped out in public since giving birth to their first child, a bouncing baby boy, on Oct. 19.
<p> The couple has yet to announce the name of the newborn, who was nowhere to be seen.
<p> The "Chasing Pavements" songbird, however, looked happy and very relaxed as she hit the pavement in a comfortable-looking all-black velour outfit sans makeup and sporting a ponytail. The duo also took with them her beloved red dachshund, Louie .
<p> While she takes a break from the spotlight, Adele hasn't left it entirely, as her eponymous theme song for the new James Bond film, Skyfall , has breached the top 10 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
