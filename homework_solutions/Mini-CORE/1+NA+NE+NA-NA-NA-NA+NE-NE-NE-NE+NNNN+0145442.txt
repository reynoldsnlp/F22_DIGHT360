<h> 'Prince Harry Was The Target': Chilling Message From Taliban As Two US Soldiers Killed In Attack
<p> Two US marines have died and several others have been hurt by an attack on a major Allied military base in Afghanistan late last night.
<p> The Taliban have told Sky News that Prince Harry, who was more than a mile away from the scene, was their target.
<p> They had initially claimed that their attack was a response to a low-budget YouTube film which is said to have motivated Libian rioters to kill the US ambassador.

<p> Sources for Sky News say that 18 Taliban militants died in the attack, whilst reporter Stuart Ramsey said: "It appears that rather than the attack being linked to the video, it was actually Prince Harry that was the target."
<p> "This is quite a development, that the Taliban is confirming Prince Harry was the primary target."
<p> The Ministry of Defense commented: "ISAF have confirmed that two US Marine Corps service personnel were killed and that there were some other ISAF casualties."
<p> Prince Harry turns 28 today. He arrived in Afghanistan for his second tour of duty last Friday.
