<h> We are living in broken Britain - and almost half of us want to emigrate, says poll
<p> Most voters believe we are living in broken Britain, according to a poll.
<p> Nearly three fifths say they hardly recognise the country they are living in and are deeply pessimistic about the state of Britain today.
<p> The survey shows that 70 per cent believe that society is now broken and 68 per cent believe people who play by the rules get a raw deal.
<p> Grim picture: A street of closed down shops reflects the pessimism of the times
<p> Many say they are worried by the pace of social change and 42 per cent admit they would like to emigrate, the Populus poll for the Times found.
<p> Women, working-class people and Tory voters were more likely to say that they hardly recognise their own country.
<p> Overall, 64 per cent think that Britain is going in the wrong direction and just 31 per cent believe it is on the right track.
<p> This is a widely used measure of mood in the U.S., where 57 per cent of people think America is going wrong and 37 per cent believe it is on the right track.
<p> It is not all gloom. Three fifths (60 per cent) of those polled say they look to the future with optimism, against 38 per cent who are looking forward with anxiety.
<p> While 45 per cent say Britain's best years are behind us, 50 per cent say that they are still to come.
<p> More than half the public (55 per cent) say that their children's lives will be better than their own, while 37 per cent say that they will be worse.
<p> Voters' main fire is directed at political institutions: 73 per cent say politics is broken in Britain and 77 per cent say there are far fewer people in public life that they admire than there used to be.
<p> The poll suggests anger at MPs who have had to repay expenses.
<p> A third say that they will vote against their local MP if he or she had been required to repay money.
<p> David Cameron claimed yesterday that his generation of Tories were better placed than the Government to 'fix broken politics', and unveiled new rules that would bar former ministers in the private sector from lobbying government for two years.

<p> Whilst I miss certain things, (Tesco, BBC, pubs, football) overall life here is far better than the UK. I tried to emigrate to the US or Canada for years and when I finally succeeded it was an incredible relief to be somewhere other than Britain. What is most ironic is what I blamed the most for Englands decline was immigration, so I in turn emigrated out of the problem.
<p> I hear a lot of complaints about the Labour party's performance but people don't cite many specific examples on what has changed in Brittan over the last 10-20 years due to this party. I would be interested to hear your thoughts on what effect Labour has had...
<p> Having worked in the USA for a short time i found it full of delightful, open and warm people. If i had the money i too would leave, i love Scotland but dispair about the way it is run. We elect politicians to run the country based on what we read in the various manifestos only for them to go back on what they promised, and now Cameron has performed a U turn on his statement re a referendum on the european treaty ibelieve a tory government will not help, it will mainly be more of the same. Is there a party out there (possibly still to be officially formed) that can work for the British people ? I feel its out only hope.
<p> Hello Lesley (ex-pat), Alberta, Canada (10/2, 05:23): Thank you for your comment but no interest in spending life submerged for months on end in SNOW. Having said that, would add that I've liked every Canadian I've ever met and know that Vancouver isn't snowbound - just rainy quite a lot, like the U.K. I'm staying put, in the land of my birth - visiting friends in Bath and the glorious Cotswolds at the weekend. There are already daffodils in my garden ...
<p> So most people agree that it's broken. Will it be fixed? Cameron will never get a better chance to change things. After doing it the marxist way for 13 years Britain is ready to see some hard choices made. Is Cameron willing to take on the pressure groups, the human rights wallies and the EU? Or is he going to be just one more part of the problem? We want to believe. We really do. But we've lived so long under spin and malice that we're cynical.
<p> So the mail says that the vast majority want to emigrate, and yet they expect the Tories to be in power in a few months, sort of tells you something about the hope of the people in relation to the abilities of the Tory party tax breaks for the rich. They are all getting out whilst the going is still good.
<p> There are a few posters 'having a go' at American's on here. Every American I have come across in my life has been nothing, but polite and kind, their society can't be that bad then can it? Certainly most people I encounter in public these days in England are rude (and from all walks of life).
<p> Left to come to Canada 22 years ago with 2 teenagers. They are both married now, have good jobs and a life style that you in the UK can only dream of. It was the best thing I have ever done. Have been back to the UK once, believe me it will be long time before I visit again. If possible get out while you are still allowed to bring anything with you.
<p> - John, Dallas, Texas, Your figures for gun crime are misleading. The population of Texas is just under half that of the UK and your land mass is almost 3 times bigger. If the People of Texas lived in more congested areas I would doubt those figures would hold up. Dallas 2006 was statistically the most violent city in the US with a population of over 1 million.... You can't compare apples with oranges.....
