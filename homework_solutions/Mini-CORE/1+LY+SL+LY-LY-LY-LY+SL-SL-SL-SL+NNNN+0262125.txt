<h> David Foster - Just For a Moment lyrics
<p> We laugh until we had to cry And we love right down to our last goodbye We were the best, I think we'll ever be Just you and me For just a moment
<p> We chase that dream we never found And sometimes we let one another down But the love we made, Made everything alright We shone so bright For just a moment Time goes on, People touch and they're gone And you and I will never love again Like we did then
<p> Someday when we both reminisce (We both say) We both say There wasn't too much we missed And through the tears (And through the tears) The smile when we recall We had it all For just a moment
<p> Time goes on... Ahh... People touch and then they're gone But you and I will never really end Will never love again... Like we did then
