<p> The Indian team featured several Olympic medalists from Beijing, including rifle shooter and Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra , who failed to advance into the final rounds of his event in London. Wrestler and Olympic bronze medalist Sushil Kumar managed to claim another medal by winning silver in the men's freestyle wrestling. The Indian Olympic Association also appointed him to be the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.
<p> This was India's most successful Olympics in terms of total medal tally, having won a total of 6 medals (2 silver and 4 bronze), doubling the nation's previous record (3 medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics ). Two medals each were awarded to the athletes in shooting and wrestling. India also set a historical milestone for the female athletes who won two Olympic medals. Badminton player and world junior champion Saina Nehwal became the first Indian athlete to win an Olympic bronze medal in the women's singles. Boxer Mary Kom , on the other hand, lost to Great Britain's Nicola Adams in the semi-final match, but settled for the bronze in the first ever women's flyweight event.
<p> Eleven Indian shooters qualified for the London Olympics. Seven male and four female. India has earned 11 quotas in shooting events. [ 11 ] India has been most successful in this category this year with Gagan Narang and Vijay Kumar winning bronze and silver medals respectively.
<p> An unknown woman in civilian attire was seen walking at the head of the Indian Olympic team's march past during the Parade of Nations . Her presence attracted media attention throughout India and raised questions about security at the Olympic Games. The woman was subsequently identified as Madhura Nagendra (incorrectly referred to by some sources as Madhura Honey [ 19 ] [ 20 ] ), a graduate student from Bangalore living in London [ 21 ] and a dancer in a segment of the opening ceremony co-ordinated by Danny Boyle . [ 22 ] The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games issued an apology to the Indian contingent over the incident and revoked Nagendra's Olympic security accreditation. [ 23 ] On her return to India, Nagendra issued a public apology for her "error of judgement". [ 24 ]
<p> A win by Vikas Krishan in the welterweight pre-quarters was overturned after an appeal by the opponent Errol Spence . The Indian was given four penalty points and the score was changed from 11"13 to 15"13 in favour of Errol Spence. [ 27 ] The decision was overturned citing the nine holding fouls committed by the Indian boxer in the third round and for spitting out the gumshield intentionally. As the jury's decision was final, no further appeal by the Indians were permitted. India through its Acting Chef de Mission Brigadier PKM Raja approached the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) [ 28 ] but the appeal was rejected. [ 29 ]
<p> Boxer Manoj Kumar lost his pre quarterfinal light welterweight bout against Great Britain's Tom Stalker in a controversial manner. The boxer was at the wrong end of some of the dubious judging calls and he cried "cheating" openly before leaving the boxing arena. [ 30 ]
