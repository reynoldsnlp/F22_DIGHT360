<h> Apollo Sunshine - I Was On The Moon lyrics
<p> I was on the moon when you were born Taking one small step And thinking it was a giant leap
<p> December 1988 Cub Scouts on a battleship It kept raining where I was standing I think I have pictures of that day Tucked away in books and shelves throughout my mind
<p> And on that very same day A baby blue boy brother's Brought into this world I think I have pictures of that On display in frames and albums of that kind
<p> I was on the moon when you were born At least I think I was You see, I can't remember 'cause
<p> I think, maybe, I was in the room when you were born Filling books with words 'Cause I had nothing to say
<p> Fifteen years after '88 I missed every baseball game But you look so handsome at funerals Or a lame holiday brunch And I want you to see how beautiful you look to me So I'll be home soon I'll be home soon
<p> I was on the moon when you were born Trying to write for you The perfect song
<p> Fifteen years after '88 Writing in a different room Still trying to balance freedom And at the same time Let a family know that I'm still alive Still alive, still alive, still alive
