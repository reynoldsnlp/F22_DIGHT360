<p> Vacation Packages Spots Tonga:
<p> Everest: This is a pinnacle dive, located around 2.0 miles offshore. It begins at 2-3 meters down, before descending into the depths.

<p> Tunnels: This dive is made up of two fissures, which you will swim north-south and then south -- north. You should see some very big humphead maori wrasse, as well as lobsters. Macro lovers will be pleased to know that this is a good place to see nudibranches. This dive will suit all abilities.
<p> Cathedral: A lovely dive, where a gap in a coral wall leads to a large cathedral cave. The cave is occupied by a family of lionfish, and a resident large grouper. There's also a coral garden a few meters down. The maximum depth is 20 meters.
<p> Lafa Lafa: This dive name means 'seasick' in the local language -- perhaps not the most inviting name, but it is 4 miles offshore! 3 meters down is a coral garden, where you'll see all kinds of tropical fish. However, another attraction is that this is one of the best dives in Ha'api to see sharks, including white tips, silver tips, black tips and even the occasional tiger shark. The maximum depth is 25 meters.
