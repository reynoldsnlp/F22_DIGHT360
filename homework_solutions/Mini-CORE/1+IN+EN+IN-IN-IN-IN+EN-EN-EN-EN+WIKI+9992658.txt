<p> At Yale, Collins worked under the direction of Sherman Weissman , and in 1984 the two published a paper, "Directional Cloning of DNA Fragments at a Large distance From an Initial Probe: a Circularization Method". [ 3 ] The method described was named chromosome jumping , to emphasize the contrast with an older and much more time-consuming method of copying DNA fragments called chromosome walking . [ 4 ]
<p> Several scientific teams worked in the 1970s and 1980s to identify genes and their loci as a cause of cystic fibrosis . Progress was modest until 1985, when Lap-Chee Tsui and colleagues at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children identified the locus for the gene. [ 7 ] It was then determined that a shortcut was needed to speed the process of identification, so Tsui contacted Collins, who agreed to collaborate with the Toronto team and share his chromosome-jumping technique. The gene was identified in June 1989, [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and the results were published in the journal Science on Sept. 8, 1989. [ 10 ] This identification was followed by other genetic discoveries made by Collins and a variety of collaborators. They included isolation of the genes for Huntington's disease , [ 11 ] neurofibromatosis , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 , [ 14 ] and Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome . [ 15 ]
<p> In 1994, Collins founded NHGRI's Division of Intramural Research, [ 17 ] a collection of investigator-directed laboratories that conduct genome research on the NIH campus.
<p> In June 2000, Collins was joined by President Bill Clinton and biologist Craig Venter in making the announcement of a working draft of the human genome . [ 18 ] He stated that "It is humbling for me, and awe-inspiring to realize that we have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only to God." [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] An initial analysis was published in February 2001, and scientists worked toward finishing the reference version of the human genome sequence by 2003, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of James D. Watson and Francis Crick 's publication of the structure of DNA .
<p> Another major activity at NHGRI during his tenure as director was the creation of the haplotype map of the human genome. This International HapMap Project produced a catalog of human genetic variations-called single-nucleotide polymorphisms -which is now being used to discover variants correlated with disease risk. Among the labs engaged in that effort is Collins' own lab at NHGRI, which has sought to identify and understand the genetic variations that influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes .
<p> In addition to his basic genetic research and scientific leadership, Collins is known for his close attention to ethical and legal issues in genetics. He has been a strong advocate for protecting the privacy of genetic information and has served as a national leader in securing the passage of the federal Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act, which prohibits gene-based discrimination in employment and health insurance. [ 22 ] In 2013, spurred by concerns over the publication of the genome of the widely used HeLa cell line derived from the late Henrietta Lacks , Collins and other NIH leaders worked with the Lacks family to reach an agreement to protect their privacy, while giving researchers controlled access to the genomic data. [ 23 ]
<p> Building on his own experiences as a physician volunteer in a rural missionary hospital in Nigeria , [ 24 ] Collins is also very interested in opening avenues for genome research to benefit the health of people living in developing nations. For example, in 2010, he helped establish an initiative called Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) [ 25 ] to advance African capacity and expertise in genomic science.
<p> Collins announced his resignation from NHGRI on May 28, 2008, but has continued to maintain an active lab there. [ 26 ]
<p> On July 8, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Collins as Director of the National Institutes of Health, [ 27 ] and the Senate unanimously confirmed him for the post. He was sworn in by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on August 7, 2009. [ 28 ]
<p> Science writer Jocelyn Kaiser opined that Collins was "known as a skilled administrator and excellent communicator," that Obama's nomination "did not come as a big surprise" and that the appointment "ignited a volley of flattering remarks from researchers and biomedical groups." Yet, she wrote, Collins "does have his critics," some of them who were concerned with the new director's "outspoken Christian faith." [ 29 ]
<p> In October 2009, shortly after his nomination as NIH director, Collins stated in an interview in the New York Times ,"I have made it clear that I have no religious agenda for the N.I.H., and I think the vast majority of scientists have been reassured by that and have moved on." [ 32 ]
<p> On Oct. 1, 2009, in the second of his four appearances on The Colbert Report , Collins discussed his leadership at the NIH and other topics such as personalized medicine and stem cell research . And, in November 2011, Collins was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
<p> Mention of Collins' love of guitar playing and motorcycle riding can often be found in articles about him. [ 39 ] While directing NHGRI, he formed a rock band with other NIH scientists. Sometimes the band, called "The Directors," dueled with a rock band from Johns Hopkins University , led by cancer researcher Bert Vogelstein . Lyrics of The Directors' songs included spoofs of rock and gospel classics re-written to address the challenges of contemporary biomedical research. [ 40 ] Collins has performed at TEDMED 2012 , StandUpToCancer, [ citation needed ] and Rock Stars of Science. [ 41 ]
<p> Collins has described his parents as "only nominally Christian " and by graduate school he considered himself an atheist . However, dealing with dying patients led him to question his religious views, and he investigated various faiths. He familiarized himself with the evidence for and against God in cosmology, and used Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis [ 50 ] as a foundation to re-examine his religious view. He eventually came to a conclusion, and became an Evangelical Christian during a hike on a fall afternoon. He has described himself as a "serious Christian". [ 22 ]
<p> Collins has rejected the concept of intelligent design , and for this reason he was not asked to participate in the 2008 documentary Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed . Walt Ruloff, a producer for the film, claimed that by rejecting intelligent design, Collins was "toeing the party line", which Collins called "just ludicrous". [ 54 ] [ clarification needed ] In 2007, Collins founded the BioLogos Foundation to "contribute to the public voice that represents the harmony of science and faith". He served as the foundation's president until he was confirmed as director of the NIH. [ 55 ]
<p> In an interview with National Geographic in February 2007, writer John Horgan criticized Collins' description of agnosticism as "a cop-out". In response, Collins clarified his position on agnosticism so as to exclude
<p> earnest agnostics who have considered the evidence and still don't find an answer. I was reacting to the agnosticism I see in the scientific community, which has not been arrived at by a careful examination of the evidence. I went through a phase when I was a casual agnostic, and I am perhaps too quick to assume that others have no more depth than I did. [ 56 ]
<p> In a 1998 interview with Scientific American , Collins stated that he is "intensely uncomfortable with abortion as a solution to anything" and does not "perceive a precise moment at which life begins other than the moment of conception". [ 57 ]

""It is humbling for me, and awe-inspiring," he said, standing at Clinton's side, "to realize that we have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only to God." That moment moved Collins -- who is married and has two grown daughters - to talk more publicly about his faith and to write the book. "It's been a bit like taking a public bath," he said."
