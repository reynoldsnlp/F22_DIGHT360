<h> The A Team (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> And they say she's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen but lately Her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us
<p> 'Cos we're just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly
<p> And they say she's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen but lately Her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us
<p> 'Cos we're just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple of grams But she don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland And sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly
<p> An angel will die Covered in white, closed eyed And hoping for a better life This time will fade out tonight Straight down the line
<p> And they say she's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen but lately Her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries They scream The worst things in life come free to us
<p> And we're all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And we don't want to go outside tonight And in the pipe fly to the Motherland Or sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly, fly, fly For angels to fly, to fly, to fly For angels to die.
<h> Drunk (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> I wanna be drunk when I wake up On the right side of the wrong bed And never an excuse I made up Tell you the truth I what didn't kill me It never made me stronger at all Love will scar your make up Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there I'm sat here wishing I was sober I know I'll never hold you like I used to
<p> But a house gets cold when you cut the heating Without you to hold I'll be freezing Can't rely on my heart to beat in 'Cos you take parts of it every evening Take words out of my mouth just from breathing Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
<p> Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again To feel a little love
<p> I wanna hold your heart in both hands Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then? Keep it between friends Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
<p> There maybe other people like us Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before And you don't hold me anymore
<p> On cold days cold plays out like the band's name I know I can't heal things with a handshake You know I can change, as I began saying You cut me wide open like landscape Open bottles of beer but never champagne To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
<p> Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again To feel a little love
<p> All by myself, I'm here again All by myself, you know I'll never change All by myself All by myself
<p> I'm just drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love
<h> U.N.I. (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> I found your hair band on my bedroom floor The only evidence that you've been here before And I don't get waves of missing you anymore They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes Never getting dry, so I get high, smoke away the days never sleep with the light on Weeks pass in the blink of an eye and I'm still drunk at the end of the night I don't drink like everybody else I do it to forget things about myself Stumble and fall with the head spin I got, my mind's with you but my heart's just not
<p> So am I close to you anymore if it's over? And there's no chance that we'll work it out That's why you and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
<p> Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that I never wanna settle down, come around, break up the love like Lego now Never wanna turn into another like you Sleep with my thoughts and I dance with my views Everything's great, not everything's sure but you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus Now I'm in position to be another stalker like everything I say seems to all sound awkward
<p> Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous on the surface And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it, pain is only relevant if it still hurts I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative and go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss
<p> So am I close to you anymore if it's over? And there's no chance that we'll work it out You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
<p> Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now And maybe I can let myself down And I'm thinking I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground And keep looking around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
<p> Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered From all that I've done wrong And I know you'll say that I'm the only one But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will
<p> 'Cos you and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
<h> Grade 8 (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> My mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner Be a true heart not a follower, we're not done yet And I see it in your movements tonight if we should ever do this right I'm never gonna let you down, I'll never let you down And I'm keeping on the down low and I'll keep you around so I'll know That I'll never let you down, I'll never let you down
<p> You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down, now You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I never felt this way I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down, now
<p> My eyes are a river filler, this drink is a liver killer My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again Your body is my ballpoint pen and your mind is my new best friend Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again, now And I see it in your movements tonight if we should ever do this right I'm never gonna let you down, I'll never let you down I'll keep it on the down low and I'll keep you around so I'll know That I'll never let you down, I'll never let you down
<p> You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I never felt this way I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
<p> You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I never felt this way I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
<h> Wake Me Up (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> I should ink my skin with your name And take my passport out again and just replace it See I could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles 'Cos maybe you're loveable and maybe you're my snowflake And your eyes turn from green to grey in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair 'cos I love the way you flick it off your shoulder And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
<p> And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me? Could you make me a cup a tea, to open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek 'cos we've watched it twelve times But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too And if your DVD breaks today, you shoulda got a VCR Because I've never owned a Blu-ay, true say And now I've always been shit at computer games because your brother always beats me,
<p> And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me and be asking me if I'm gonna be home next week And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep and flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
<p> And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
<p> And I think you hate the smell of smoke, you always try and get me to stop You drink as much as me, and I get drunk a lot So I take you to the beach and walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace so the heart falls where your chest is And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
<p> Against yours now 'Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up
<h> Small Bump (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> You're just a small bump unborn in four months you're brought to life You might be left with my hair but you'll have your mother's eyes I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans A small bump in four months you brought to life
<p> You're just a small bump, I know you'll grow into your skin With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice And eyelids closed to be soon open wide A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes
<p> And I'll hold you tightly and tell you nothing but truth If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you
<p> You are my one and only And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb And hold me tight You are my one and only And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb And hold me tight And you'll be alright
<p> Then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet When you're half asleep I'll leave you be Right in front of me, for a couple weeks So I can keep you safe
<p> 'Cos you were just a small bump unborn for four months, then torn from life Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why.
<h> This (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> This is the start of something beautiful This is the start of something new You are the one that will make me lose it all You are the start of something new
<p> And I'll throw it all away And watch you fall into my arms again And I'll throw it all away And watch you fall, now
<p> You are the earth that I will stand upon You are the words that I will sing
<p> And I've thrown it all away And watched you fall into his arms again And I've thrown it all away And watched you fall, now
<p> And take me back, take me home Watch me fall down to earth Take me back
<p> For this is the start of something beautiful You are the start of something new
<h> The City (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> This city never sleeps, I hear the people walk by when it's late Sirens bleed through my windowsill, I can't close my eyes Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive, the lights that blind keep me awake Hood up and lace untied, sleep fills my mind Can't control what I'm into
<p> London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home
<p> I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you If the city never sleeps then that makes two
<p> The pavement is my friend, it will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up and puts me down This is not what I'm used to And the shop across the road fulfils my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls, I don't think I'm gonna make it Past tomorrow
<p> London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home
<p> I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you If the city never sleeps then that makes two
<p> And my lungs hurt and my ears bled With the sound of the city life echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along
<p> London calls me a stranger This is not my home, home
<p> I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you If the city never sleeps then that makes two
<h> Lego House (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house If things go wrong we can knock it down My three words have two meanings but there's one thing on my mind It's all for you
<p> And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now
<p> I'm out of touch, I'm out of love I'll pick you up when you're getting down And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind I'll do it all for you in time And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now, now
<p> I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours
<p> I'm out of touch, I'm out of love I'll pick you up when you're getting down And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind I'll do it all for you in time And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
<p> Don't hold me down, I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
<p> And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now
<p> I'm out of touch, I'm out of love I'll pick you up when you're getting down And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind, I'll do it all for you in time And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now I'm out of touch, I'm out of love I'll pick you up when you're getting down And out of all these things I've done, I will love you better now
<h> You Need Me, I Don?t Need You (Ed Sheeran 2011)
<p> Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd That's you now, hello, ciao, seems that life is great now See me lose focus as I sing to you loud I can't, no, I won't hush, I say the words that make you blush I'm gonna sing this now See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is I'm like glue, I stick to other artists I'm not you, now that would be disastrous Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
<p> I sing, I write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell Don't need another wordsmith to make the tune sell Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School I came fast with the way I act, right I can't last, if I'm smoking on a crack pipe And I won't be a product of my genre My mind will always be stronger than my songs are Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating When I perform live feels like I am meditating Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me Young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
<p> 'Cos with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right, I won't stop till my name is in lights At stadium heights with Damien Rice, on red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice Long nighter, short height and I'm going hyper Never be anything but a singer-songwriter Yeah, the game's over but now I'm on a new level Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal People think that I'm bound to blow up, I've done around about a thousand shows But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out From day one, I've been prepared, with VO5 wax for my ginger hair So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds 'Cos it's another day, plus I keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift Into another rapper's shoes using new laces Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for majors Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back Clean-cut kid without a razor for the moustache I hit back when the pen hurts me, I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though According to the MySpace and YouTube videos I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio Truly broke, never growing up call me Rufio Melody music maker, reading all the papers They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
<p> Kiss me like you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved This feels like falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
<p> Settle down with me and I'll be your safety, you'll be my lady I was made to keep your body warm but I'm cold as the wind blows So hold me in your arms My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed to my neck I'm falling for your eyes but they don't know me yet And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now
<p> Kiss me like you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved This feels like falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
<p> Yeah I've been feeling everything from hate to love from love to lust from lust to truth I guess that's how I know you So hold you close to help you give it up
<p> So kiss me like you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved This feels like falling in love, falling in love, falling in love Kiss me like you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved, you wanna be loved This feels like falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
<p> Give me love like never before 'Cos lately I've been craving more And it's been a while but I still feel the same Maybe I should let you go You know I'll fight my corner And that tonight I'll call ya After my blood is drowning in alcohol No I just wanna hold ya
<h> Cold Coffee (Ed Sheeran & Amy Wadge 2009)
<p> She's like cold coffee in the morning I'm drunk off last night's whisky and coke She'll make me shiver without warning And make me laugh, as if I'm in on joke
<p> And you can stay with me forever Or you could stay with me for now And tell me if I'm wrong And tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand To help you fall asleep tonight Tell me if I know Tell me if I do Tell me how to fall in love The way you want me to
<p> I'll wake with coffee in the morning But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea Outside, the day is up and calling But I don't have to be So please go back to sleep
<p> And stay with me forever Or you could stay with me for now And tell me if I'm wrong And tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand To help you fall asleep tonight Tell me if I know Tell me if I do Tell me how to fall in love The way you want me to
<p> Cos I love the way you wake me up For goodness sake, will my love not be enough?
<p> Tell me if I'm wrong Tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand To help you fall asleep tonight Tell me if I know Tell me if I do Tell me how to fall in love The way you want me to
<p> Tell me if I'm wrong Tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand To help you fall asleep tonight
<h> She (Ed Sheeran & Amy Wadge 2009)
<p> I paid all my dues And she wanted to know That I'd never leave her Now I'm ready to go And strange as it seems She's endless to me She's just like paperwork But harder to read
<p> Patience, my enemy And loving's my friend It's harder to leave With my heart on my sleeve Than to stay and just pretend Oh, she knows me so well Oh, she knows me like I know myself
<p> I made all my plans And she has made hers She kept me in mind But I wasn't sure I searched every room For a way to escape But every time I tried to leave She keeps holding on to me For dear life And blocking my way
<p> Patience, my enemy And loving's my friend It's harder to leave With my heart on my sleeve Than to stay and just pretend Oh, she knows me so well Oh, she knows me like I know myself
<p> And like the back of her hand She already understands everything Won't you stay? She says And she already knows how it goes And where she stands I'll stay, anyway Cos she knows me so well Oh, she knows me like I know myself Oh, she knows me so well Oh, she knows me like I know myself
<h> The A Team (Ed Sheeran 2010) (Not Available on Loose Change)
<p> And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us Cos we're just under the upperhand And go mad for a couple of grams And she don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly
<p> And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us Cos we're just under the upperhand And go mad for a couple of grams And she don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly An angel will die Covered in white Closed eye And hoping for a better life This time, we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line
<p> And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries They scream The worst things in life come free to us And we're all under the upperhand Go mad for a couple of grams And we don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland Or sell love to another man It's too cold For angels to fly Angels to fly To fly, fly Or angels to die
<h> Homeless (Ed Sheeran & Anna Krantz 2009)
<p> Could I wake up next to you When we're hitting double figures Look into your eyes Like I'm looking into double mirrors Could you make it any clearer Everything's such a blur It's not my turn It's hers to get hurt On a late night Coming home from way too many train rides Lace not as red as my face I'm home at the same time Highbury estate's fine Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines
<p> I haven't slept for the past week Two hours ain't enough for me I feel inspired, at quarter to three am I haven't changed since our last meet I'm still getting all my meals for free Think I'm being shunned by my feet again
<p> It's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
<p> And now I'm sitting on a night bus Flicking through my Ipod Feeling kinda tired So I try to close my eyes up Driver, turn the lights off Lights on, on stage, mics on Song plays, nice one Gotta keep my hype strong Truth be, never went to Uni People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see I'm never gonna do one Gonna live past 22, done Everything I need to Except get a 2:1
<p> I haven't slept for the past week Two hours ain't enough for me I feel inspired, at quarter to three am I haven't changed since our last meet I'm still getting all my food for free Think I'm being shunned by my feet again
<p> It's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
<p> It's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
<h> Little Bird (Ed Sheeran 2009)
<p> If we take this bird in With its broken leg We could nurse it She said Come inside For a little lie down with me If you fall asleep It wouldn't be the worst thing But when I wake up Your make-up is on my shoulder And tell me, if I lie down Would you stay now And let me hold you?
<p> But if I kissed you Will your mouth read this truth Darling, how I miss you Strawberries taste how lips do And it's not complete yet Mustn't get our feet wet Cos that leads to regret Diving in too soon And I'll owe it all to you My little bird My little bird
<p> If we take a walk out In the morning dew We could lay down So I'm next to you Come inside For a little home-made tea If you fall asleep Then at least you're next to me And if I wake up You see, it's late, love Go back to sleep I'm covered by nature And I'm safe now Underneath this oak tree With you beside me
<p> But if I kissed you Will your mouth read this truth? Darling, how I miss you Strawberries taste how lips do And it's not complete yet Mustn't get our feet wet Cos that leads to regret Diving in too soon And I'll owe it all to you My little bird My little bird
<p> And of all these things I'm sure of I'm not quite certain Of your love And you made me scream But then I made you cry When I left that little bird With its broken leg to die
<p> But if I kissed you Will your mouth read this truth Darling, how I miss you Strawberries taste like lips do And it's not complete yet Mustn't get our feet wet Cos that leads to regret Diving in too soon And I'll owe it all to you My little bird My little bird You're my little bird
<h> Sofa (Ed Sheeran & Anna Krantz 2009)
<p> She's reinventing loving me When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa It must have been about 5.01 Like my blue ripped jeans And my eyes are closed And I'm way too tired Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire On the sofa, where we lay I wanna stay inside all day And it's cold outside, again
<p> And we're both so high We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica We can go where you want Say the word and I'll take ya But I'd rather stay on the sofa On the sofa, with you
<p> When the morning comes We're not watching Formula I It's not what we breathe for So kick off the day with Friends on T4 Two, boiled and brew Two sugars ain't too sweet for you On the sofa, where we lay I wanna stay inside all day And it's cold outside, again And we're still so high
<p> We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica We can go where you want Say the word and I'll take ya But I'd rather stay on the sofa On the sofa, with you
<p> And it feels like I'm flying And it feels like We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica Through the streets of New York That is where I will take ya Paris, Rome, to Rio Passing through Las Vegas We can go where you want Say the word, and I'll take ya But I'd rather stay on the sofa On the sofa On the sofa, with you
<h> One Night (Ed Sheeran & Jake Gosling 2010)
<p> Lying in a bedroom Lighting up a Benson Face hair is growing So I cut with a vengeance Hey, did I mention As she makes an entrance Said I had a tendency To finish off a sentence
<p> Oh well, she's a local girl No make-up Cos she knows me well Hair tied up in elastic band With a kiss on the cheek For her one-night man
<p> Is it fast food I'll regret it after And I needed money But I'm too shy to ask her So she buys me chips and cheese And I tell her I love her And she's all I need I take it with a cold glass Of the fruit and the barley She's still a sucker for the Apple and Bacardi Heading to the party Sitting in the car seat B.E.P. on radio It makes me feel naughty
<p> She knows me well Bit of a catch To have a local girl Hair tied up in elastic band With a kiss on the cheek For her one-night man I don't wanna go alone I don't wanna go alone
<p> Tell her that I love her Tell her that I need her Tell her that she's more Than a one-night stand Tell her that she turns my cheeks The colour of my hair All I wanna do is be near
<p> Tell her that I want her Tell her that I need her Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand Tell her that I love her More than anyone else If you don't, then I'll tell her myself
<p> And we've got love in us So if the drink kill us We're gonna dance all night Till the floor fillers If we talk outside I say I hate wasps too I don't really dance So I'll just watch you Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that's alright I don't wanna be here I'm not the sofa type Tell me if you have a toothbrush You don't mind sharing She said I wanna take off What you're wearing I don't wanna go alone I don't wanna go alone
<p> Tell her that I love her Tell her that I need her Tell her that she's more Than a one-night stand Tell her that she turns my cheeks The colour of my hair All I wanna do is be near Tell her that I want her Tell her that I need her Tell her that she's more Than a one-night stand Tell her that I love her More than anyone else If you don't, I'll tell her myself
<p> She's like the fast food I'll regret it after And I needed money But I'm too shy to ask her But she buys me chips and cheese So I tell her that she's all I need
<p> Tell her that she's more Than a one-night stand Tell her that she turns my cheeks The colour of my hair All I wanna do is be near Tell her that she's more Than a one-night stand Tell her that I love her More than anyone else If you don't, I'll tell her myself
<p> Tell her that I love her Tell her that I need her That she's more Than a one-night stand Tell her that she turns my cheeks The colour of my hair All I wanna do is be near Tell her that I want her Tell her that I need her Tell her that she's more Than a one-night stand Tell her that I love her More than anyone else If you don't, I'll tell her myself
<p> There's a firefly Loose tonight Better catch it Before it burns this place down And I lie If I don't feel so right But the world looks better Through your eyes
<p> Teach my skin Those new tricks Warm me up With your lips Heart to heart Melt me down It's too cold In this town Close your eyes Lean on me Face to mouth Lips to cheek Feeling numb In my feet You're the one To help me Get to sleep
<p> And hold me tight Don't let me breathe Feeling like You won't believe
<p> There's a firefly Loose tonight Better catch it Before it burns this place down And I lie If I don't feel so right But the world looks better Through your eyes
<p> It's only been One night of love And maybe That is not enough
<p> Hold me tight Don't let me breathe Feeling like You won't believe
<p> It's only been One night of love And maybe That's not enough
<p> Hold me tight Don't let me breathe Feeling like You won't believe
<p> There's a firefly loose tonight Better catch it Before it burns this place down And I lie If I don't feel so right But the world looks better Through your eyes
<h> The City (Ed Sheeran & Jake Gosling 2008)
<p> This city never sleeps, I hear the people walk by when it's late Sirens bleed through my windowsill, I can't close my eyes Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive, the lights that blind keep me awake Hood up and lace untied, sleep fills my mind Can't control what I'm into
<p> London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home
<p> I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you If the city never sleeps then that makes two
<p> The pavement is my friend, it will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up and puts me down This is not what I'm used to And the shop across the road fulfils my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls, I don't think I'm gonna make it Past tomorrow
<p> London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home
<p> I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you If the city never sleeps then that makes two
<p> And my lungs hurt and my ears bled With the sound of the city life echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along
<p> London calls me a stranger This is not my home, home
<p> I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you If the city never sleeps then that makes two
<h> You Need Me, I Don't Need You (Ed Sheeran 2008)
<p> I don't want bruise your ears Or hurt you again But I got back-stabbed by a black cab When I needed a friend
<p> But now I'm in town, break it down Thinking of making a new sound Playing a different show every night In front of a new crowd That's you now, hello, ciao Seems that life is great now See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud I can't, no, I won't hush I'll say the words that make you blush I'm gonna sing this now See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is I'm like glue, I stick to other artists I'm not you, now that would be disastrous Let me sing and do my thing And move to greener pastures See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy I won't stay put Give me the chance to be free Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you
<p> Does he write his own tune? Does he write his own verse? hell Or need another wordsmith to make the tune sell? Call yourself a singer-writer You're just bluffing Your name's on the credits And you didn't write nothing I sing fast I know that all my shit's cool I will blast And I didn't go to Brit School I came fast with the way I act, right I can't last, if I'm smoking on a crack pipe I won't be a product of my genre My mind will always be stronger than my songs are Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating When I perform live, feels like I am meditating Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me 'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi' You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
<h> So (Ed Sheeran 2009)
<p> Filled up with doubt I have to move home But I want to stay with you For all of the summer I have my plan That you won't remember If you want to see the world Then please ask your mother I cannot hold your hand To watch you go I am a liar As you might know I need you now I need your touch And your lips I need that smile And your kiss
<p> You're so cool You're so beautiful You're so You're so
<p> I see your grace From my window When it is late at night It'll show me your shadow I'm in my place Hope you remember When summer's gone I'll still sing a song Of you in September I cannot hold your hand To watch you go I am a liar As you might know I need you now I need your touch And your lips I need that smile And your kiss
<h> The City (Ed Sheeran & Jake Gosling 2008)
<p> This city never sleeps I hear the people walk by when it's late Sirens bleed through my windowsill I can't close my eyes Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive The lights that blind keep me awake With my hood up and lace untied Sleep fills my mind Don't control what I'm into
<p> London calls me a stranger A traveller This is now my home, my home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two
<p> The pavement is my friend Hey, and it will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up And puts me down This is not what I'm used to The shop across the road Fulfills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I don't think I'm gonna make it Past tomorrow
<p> London calls me a stranger A traveller This is now my home, my home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two
<p> And my lungs hurt And my ears bled With the sound of the city life Echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts But I need to move along
<p> London calls me a stranger This is not my home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two
<h> Sunburn (Ed Sheeran 2009)
<p> You're not her Though I try to see you differently I tow the line You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine I saw your eyes And then I saw her staring back at me And I will try to find another one Who suited me as well as her
<p> I moved far away from you And I want to see you here beside me, dear But things aren't clear When we never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I'd miss you I miss you
<p> She was mine I was hers And all that's in between If she would cry I would shelter her And keep her from the darkness that will be
<p> If I moved far away from you And I want to see you here beside me, dear But things aren't clear We never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I'd miss you And I miss you
<p> We never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I'd miss you And I miss you
<h> Be Like You (Ed Sheeran 2008)
<p> Happy days That left us on the floor And you breathe me Till you're not feeling sure Everything will brighten up If we go to Brighton I'll take you along the Pier Everything will lighten up If you feel too frightened I'll make it disappear, dear
<p> Darling, don't be nervous I'll understand If you'll let me go I did this on purpose Now, when I'm missing you I'll stop eating food And I'll squeeze into a dress So I can be like you And then I'll see your bitterness And why you're leaving too Maybe, I'll put you to a test And say that I love you I think that I love you
<p> Sunny days That left my skin dark red You squeeze me Till these thoughts leave my head If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated Can you see what's wrong? If you feel like you've been hated This love's too overrated See what's going on, on
<p> Darling, don't be nervous I'll understand If you'll let me go I did this on purpose Now, when I'm missing you I'll stop eating food And I'll squeeze into a dress So I can be like you And then I'll see your bitterness And why you're leaving too Maybe, I'll put you to a test And say that I love you I think that I love you
<p> Take me back to live at home Take me back to Albert Road
<p> Now I'm missing you I've stopped eating food And I've squeezed into your dress So I can feel like you But then I saw your bitterness And why you left me too I thought I'd put you to a test And say that I love you I think that I love you
<p> And I stopped eating food And I squeezed into your dress So I could feel like you But then I saw your bitterness And why you left me too Maybe I'll put you to a test And say that I love you Now it seems you loved me too
<h> You Break Me (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree My knees feel weak and I fell too fast The tide is high but we swam in too deep To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece You can take away all this mess And I could never think anything less of you
<p> 'Cos you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all I have left
<p> The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms To spur this on we left that room too long You open wide and all the lies flow out To eat you whole But we both know that you're too cold And she said 'I can put away all those lies And show you there's no surprise in me'
<p> Well still, you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all that I have left
<p> Exorcise these demons But they keep talking to me I am no believer But I believe you will relieve me I believe you will relieve me And that's what's going on
<p> 'Cos you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all that I have left
<p> You break me
<h> I?m Glad I?m Not You (Ed Sheeran 2007)
<p> It's been a while since we were here Been too long my fear is Holding back the memories of your eyes Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me All that's left is shattered hearts It's plain enough for us to see that You've got me You've got me
<p> We're just friends tangled up in loose ends I feel it coming around again Let me know where you let your heart go And I will just pretend That I have never felt this way Since you I have never felt this way Since you I feel strange Playing games It's no fuss I'm not in love
<p> We're just friends tangled up in loose ends I feel it coming around again Let me know where you let your heart go And I will just pretend That I have never felt this way Since you I have never felt this way Since you I feel strange Playing games It's no fuss I'm not in love
<h> You Need to Cut Your Hair (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> Well I walked from my house to yours In a warm cold April rain We barely went outdoors And your family took the blame Take time to be with you She can only glare I'm a bad influence, that'll do 'Cos I need to cut my hair Wash my mouth, change my clothes Just don't talk to those friends of yours Tell them not to come here anymore Time to go, don't be slow This'll only take a mo' Take yourself right out of my door
<p> It's just that they don't care Dad said beware, watch your back Just don't reply to that woman there And even if she makes a fuss Just ignore that trust And don't give in to lust And leave that one alone The girl's trouble
<p> Time spent in burnt-down shed Add up near two days Fall down and cut my head Take time to misbehave Spend time and be with you She can only glare 'Cos you're a bad influence, that'll do Boy you need to cut your hair Wash your mouth, change your clothes Just don't talk to those friends of yours Tell them not to come here anymore Time to go, don't be slow This'll only take a mo' Take yourself right out of my door
<p> It's just that they don't care Dad said beware, watch your back Just don't reply to that woman there And even if she makes a fuss Just ignore that trust And don't give in to lust And leave that one alone
<p> This is the dancing song Close your eyes Hypnotise to the beat And the movement of the week Do that shuffle of your feet And pound out the fever, either Dance as you're a true believer Cleaner lives are what you don't see Fell the weight, gravitate Feel the pace of me This world is 2D The only thing that's free in life is love And that don't come cheap
<p> It's just that they don't care Dad said beware, watch your back Just don't reply to that woman there And even if she makes a fuss Just ignore that trust And don't give in to lust And leave that one alone The girl's trouble
<h> Sara (Ed Sheeran 2007)
<p> Sara, what you do is enlighten my mind Oh wow, I said Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind
<p> Hey now 'Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue Half the guys I know are after you Cheer me up when I'm in a mood So I thought I'd write a song for you
<p> And may I say, you look like an angel today May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays If only to make you smile today 'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that
<p> Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock Behind a can of Strongbow Oh wow, I said Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do Even with that soul
<p> Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue Half the guys I know are after you Cheer me up when I'm in a mood So I thought I'd write a song for you
<p> And may I say, you look like an angel today May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays If only to make you smile today 'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that
<p> May I say, you look great May I play this to make your day
<h> Move On (Ed Sheeran & Alonestar 2007)
<p> Now it seems I've been young, dug my hole in the ground To me there's only up, there ain't no point in looking down However hard I try, I only get weaker Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold
<p> What you gotta do is never get yourself down Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground Keep out of trouble, ain't no trouble being pure Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
<p> Move on, forget it Now move on, forget it
<p> When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody Hennesey shots and glocks, all these fools on the block Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top? I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy With my head in the sky Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die So see the signs, stand to the side Open your eyes and take a look and realise The resurrection's arrived And as the mist clears, homie I arise From my tomb in disguise I'm all alone, Alonestar Urban Angel rising from the ashes Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move Now back up!
<p> Move on, forget it Now move on, forget it
<p> All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who ...what the fuck does it matter? Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder It don't matter to me All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?
<h> Yellow Pages (Ed Sheeran 2007)
<p> I felt the fall on my breast At the bottom of my stomach She put my hand on her chest While she looked into my eyes You rescued me And called up these words in threes And you know I can't forget it And 10 months on you liberate truth See, I was wrong on how I hate you And it's the worst thing that I did
<p> When I read through you You weren't translated So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages So I'd be free from it
<p> See, all this truth sparks lies in me Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy The key is just to ignore Even if this time has made me unsure And 12 months on I'm back in my mood See, I got drunk and said I loved you And it's the worst thing that I did
<p> When I read through you You weren't translated So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages So I'd be free from it
<h> Smile (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> Just give me a pen and I'll write my worries Now and again I'll try and not see that you don't care Taking the time to taste and savour Life's bitter wine and childish behaviour But you don't care
<p> And hey, I don't speak that language of youth And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth And hey, I lay in this world for a while When all is lost just smile
<p> They've written the dates and the times to follow See all the fakes that look so hollow But you don't care What ever happened to the youth and culture? Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper So you don't care
<p> And hey, I don't speak that language of youth And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth And hey, I lay in this world for a while When all is lost just smile
<h> Postcards (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> Face me, are you tired of living? Replace, she was so unforgiving And I'm so frustrated, so dilated And she's telling me I've wasted my time And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right To tell me your voice takes me through the night
<p> Your smile and your memory Simply eases me to sleep In my ear while the whispering Melts my heart on every beat
<p> Still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place And we're asking for so much more Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
<p> Face me, are you tired of living? Replace, she was so unforgiving And I'm so frustrated, so dilated And she's telling me I've wasted my time And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right To tell me your voice takes me through the night
<p> Time past, heal this broken heart Pulled away that sellotape Take your time, 'cos I won't mind I doubt if I even know that I'm awake
<p> And still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place And we're asking for so much more Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
<h> Two Blokes and A Double Bass (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> Sing the song Celestial Man Shake the thing your mother gave ya! Tear your lungs out, scream your heart Be on your worst behaviour I'd wager that you're gonna take it Make you fight nature, born and raised in Funk those things that make you go bump in the night Turn off the dark, put on the light And he said 'You and your big cheeks have got me' Along with 'Disarm' and 'Flooded Quarry' Turn off the base with the beat-box detox Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks Lampshades, carpets, the stage black You make the room's hands laugh as they clap You make my mouth water with support acts They could even match you in talent - ignore that! Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain't wrong He's got me singing to 'Amerikan Folk Song' Loop pedal class is used as weaponry You gotta know your enemy Gotta check your distance Don't talk, only whisper Slap the base so hard you get blisters Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand This ain't no fake, it's music in your hand As you run into the centre of the crowd Silence falls like water You just wanna shout 'Wow!' How did they even have the guts to do it ? If your name's Nizlopi, then there ain't much to it 'Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now
<h> The West Coast of Clare (Andy Irvine)
<p> Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief Memories I have of you Won't leave me in peace My mind was running back To the west coast of Clare Thinking of you And the times we had there
<p> I walked to Spanish Point I knew I'd find you there I stood on the white strand You were everywhere Vivid memories fade But the mood still remains I wish I could go back And be with you again
<p> In Milltown there's a pub It's there that I sat down I see you everywhere Your face is all around The search for times past Contains such sweet pain I'll banish lonesome thoughts But they'll return again
<p> I walk along the shore The rain in my face My mind is numb with grief Of you there is no trace I'll think of this again In far off lands I roam Walking with you By this cold Atlantic fog
<p> Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief Memories I have of you Won't leave me in peace My mind was running back To the west coast of Clare Thinking of you And the times we had there
<h> I Can?t Spell (Ed Sheeran 2007)
<p> I found the words to say how I feel But I just can't spell them I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field So you can tell them That I'm a different man with a different tune I didn't find love until last June But I lost it, just like I lost it all I tried to use it to break my fall 'Cos I need something, anything to replace you Or something close
<h> Hidden Track - You Break Me 2 (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree My knees feel weak and I fell too fast The tide is high but we swam in too deep To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece You can take away all this mess And I could never think anything less of you
<p> 'Cos you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all I have left
<p> The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms To spur this on we left that room too long You open wide and all the lies flow out To eat you whole But we both know that you're too cold And she said 'I can put away all those lies And show you there's no surprise in me'
<p> Well still 'Cos you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all I have left
<p> Exorcise these demons But they keep talking to me I am no believer But I believe you will relieve me I believe you will relieve me And that's what's going on
<p> 'Cos you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all that I have left
<p> You break me
<h> Open Your Ears (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> Can't get you off my mind Look at me and you will find Time after time it seems I'll say what I don't mean
<p> In your world we were the same In mine now you're the one to blame You can't remember my name We're lost, it's such a shame
<p> Listen to me Stop making me see What I've been waiting for Listen to me Stop making me see
<p> Listen to me Stop making me see What I've been waiting for Listen to me Stop making me see
<p> And I still feel like I need you still And I still feel like I'm on some pill And I still feel like I need you still
<p> Listen to me Stop making me see What I've been waiting for Listen to me Making me see
<h> Beyond the Pale (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> Just lay it all down on me It's getting harder for me to breathe Just want to know if it will be Just want to know if it is me
<p> And you know I've learned from my mistakes And how much have I got to lose? You find my heart is hard to break Can't keep playing the fool
<p> Breathe in, exhale To turn to move beyond the pale Flag up, set sail To find what's there beyond the pale
<p> I feel like I've gone to the end of the world What do I have to do?
<p> You know I've learned from my mistakes How much have I got to lose? You find my heart hard to break Can't keep playing the fool
<p> Breathe in, exhale To turn to move beyond the pale Flag up, set sail To find what's there beyond the pale
<p> What can I do Just to let you know That you're in my mind? To try and justify The way you liberate me Every time
<h> In Memory (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> I write this song in memory of The wayward smile The boy we won't forget The soul you took away from us The river flows The tears that we wept
<p> Missing you Is all that needs to be said More than blue The words inside my head
<p> And I know that you're gone
<p> The cheeky smile Of jokes and laughs The memories of times We crossed the line The stepping stones Across my mind Washed away We all now feel so blind
<p> Missing you Is all that needs to be said More than blue The words inside my head
<p> And I know that you're gone
<p> Goodbye
<h> Insomniac?s Lullaby (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> I'm getting very edgy Cos you're trying to take this from me And it's something that I wanted so bad Cos you're the definition Of someone who has to ruin The best thing that I ever had Cos you're a jealous girl And all I can say is It's your fault but partially mine For losing hope For not treating you right But that will disappear in time
<p> All I gotta do is pass you by Never say what's wrong Whenever I say why?
<p> Standing in the corner Shadowed by the light To you I seem much smaller But I know it might be you How much better could I do To be myself, not someone else? I'm losing sleep I live only for the week
<p> I've grown to ignore you Cos when I seem to bore you You pretend that you're not interested Your eyes start to twinkle Your smile starts to widen And I just seem to try and forget But you pay me no attention Even though I do But I don't care as long as you're mine It's happening every time
<p> All I gotta do is pass you by Never say what's wrong Whenever I say why?
<p> Standing in the corner Shadowed by the light To you I seem much smaller But I know it might be you How much better could I do To be myself, not someone else? I'm losing sleep I live only for the week
<p> And I'm falling harder now it seems My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams And I can't sleep although I think I can It's insomnia I think I have But who cares when I'm not your man?
<p> Standing in the corner Shadowed by the light To you I seem much smaller But I know it might be you How much better could I do To be myself, not someone else? I'm losing sleep I live only for the week
<h> Quiet Ballad of Ed (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> In shadow there lies hope Cut tension with a knife I find it hard to cope Stop playing with my life You analyse my fears Analyse my dreams Choke on burning tears Through my silent screams
<p> Things aren't what they seem
<p> Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me Tell this army of angels to make me breathe Open doors just to take away the key I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
<p> Watch me fall As I stumble at your feet Always losing in this game Your lies cut me deep And you don't even know my name With your consistency To always make me crawl And my durability Not affected at all
<p> Still things aren't what they seem
<p> Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me Tell this army of angels to make me breathe Open doors just to take away the key I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
<p> Feel the pain On my brain Feel the strain As I start to decay Feel the strain Every passing day Feel the pain As I start to decay
<p> Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me Tell this army of angels to make me breathe Open doors just to take away the key I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
<h> Billy Ruskin (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own And I am my own best friend and I need me to see That I am more than what is hiding in me
<p> Come and show me if you can See I know you're me But I can't seem to understand If you know me, place my hand on mine And we will resurrect the time That we lost when you left my mind It's psycho-paranoia disappearing in time Come and show me what makes you tick I need you to get out of my mind quick
<p> When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own And I am my own best friend and I need me to see That I am more than what is hiding in me
<h> Spark (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> Take me with you I do declare I love you dearly through here and there What can I do to make you share? What can I do to make you care?
<p> The world is harsh I'm stuck in the dark I'll make my mark I've got my spark
<p> We'd be together through bad or worse Sending letters we shall converse We could do better but we must first Make amends That depends Will you be my friend?
<p> The world is harsh I'm stuck in the dark I'll make my mark I've got my spark
<h> Pause (Ed Sheeran & Alonestar 2006)
<p> You know I got to get away To find some peace and sanity I've been playing hide-and-seek too long Shaking, making, everybody waking Setting the hi-fi bleed Keeping me back While you're spinning my track That'll knock you off your feet
<p> Monkey see what monkey do But I'm a monkey telling you I just think that we should take a break Tickity-tock the clock With the hip-hop And alonestar backing me up We won't stop I gotta be searching for my peace of mind Now let the track rewind
<p> And play, let the music play It came, so let the music say what it feels Shame, shame it took too long To see that you were wrong Now turn the song back on
<p> This is Alonestar coming at you With a new style Kicking dust Ready to bust It's Urban Angel Artistic, flipping the script Who d'you really want to get it with? Ed and Alonestar We're like live wires sparking Ready to blow We've already sown our seeds We're just waiting to grow - blow We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body Metaphorical speech when we come and see You ducking for cover Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock With Urban Angel and Alonestar And Ed - keep it locked Let the beat pump Drop the bass but don't stop We're kicking the sound Let the bass bins pound We're gonna roll Can you feel me now with my body? Get down to the sound It's Ed Sheeran in the place And Alonestar rising up We gotta rise up I said rise up
<p> And play, let the music play It came, so let the music say what it feels Shame, shame it took so long To see that you were wrong Now turn the song back on
<h> The Sea (Ed Sheeran 2006)
<p> Pass me a drink You say it's gonna take a while Your consciousness sinks Tears from a crocodile
<p> You've waited too long To finally see The sunshine in the rain Is as deep as the sea
<h> Way Home (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> Well I once heard a story about a run-down home Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone He tried to live, no effort was shown He's slowly finding a way back home
<p> He had a family with smiles and frowns They never could solve his way to be down Cos he's one dog who don't want a bone He's slowly finding a way back home
<p> He had a nice house with windows and doors He said to his wife what's mine is yours But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown He's slowly finding a way back home
<p> His children have left but the rooms are still there His misses the noise and the scents in their hair But far from the nest the babies have flown He's slowly finding a way back home
<p> His wife was an angel sent from above He never returned her kisses or love But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown This man who's finding a way back home
<p> So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon He stares at the floor, no more to roam He's slowly finding a way back home
<p> Well I once heard a story about a run-down home Where a man with regrets lived all alone He tried to live, no effort was shown He'll never find a way back home
<h> Bonus Track (Ed Sheeran 2005)
<p> I want to be real Not some conscience to myself The way you worship, never ending Some idol who's pretending to be true How you put upon yourself A man who never seems To answer to you words So go and make me over
<p> I'm a fly upon your neck You can't control me I have my words, my voice My strengths, my choice And I can cut as deep Just as deep as I need
<p> Don't want your advice Cos I've made up my own mind The way you bore me with the stories Of far and distant times I've heard it before So don't try that on me The way you worship, never-ending Some idol who's pretending to be true It could be you Brainwashed by the lies It's no surprise That you'd wanna waste your time
<p> I'm a fly upon your neck You can't control me I have my words, my voice My strengths, my choice And I can cut as deep Just as deep as I need
<h> Moody Ballad of Ed (Ed Sheeran 2003)
<p> Come on now Dry your eyes I'm sick of all your lies I've grown to despise you Already sick of what you're saying Hoping now I'm only praying My baby's gone away And I've already packed my bags You didn't know me (I've run away) You couldn't show me (What you have to say) My one and only Has gone away Far away You'll never leave me alone Now I'm off on my own I'll never ring your phone again And still you keep on crying If I said I loved you I'd be lying You need to dry your eyes And I've still gone to pack my bags You didn't know me (I've run away) You couldn't show me (What you have to say) My one and only Has gone away Far away
<h> Misery (Ed Sheeran 2004)
<p> Well, I've walked this street Well, I've walked this street before And everyone's locked up their door 'Cos they heard me coming And I've been running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she's cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery You said we went too fast And you said we wouldn't last Now I've put the past behind me And I'm running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery It's taken you a long time to see In misery And everyone's locked up their door 'Cos they heard me coming And I've been running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she's cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery You said we went too fast And you said we wouldn't last Now I've put the past behind me And I'm running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery It's taken you a long time to see In misery
<h> Typical Average (Ed Sheeran 2002)
<p> Strings on my guitar are rusty Even my best friends don't trust me Everybody thinks I must be crazy 'Cos, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen) 'Cos, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen) Everything's in a haze Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze Everything's blurry Oh, what's happened to me? Say, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen) Now, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen)
<h> Addicted (Ed Sheeran 2004)
<p> I think I took too much I'm addicted to your touch But I'm crying In shame again And now I'm high as a kite And I know I might be gone When you get home Oh well, we've come this far You're my Venus And I'm your Mars And we've passed the moon and stars And I'm gone But now I'm high as a kite And I know I'm might be gone When you get home I'm high as a kite And I know I'm almost gone When you get home So please come home
<h> I Love You (Ed Sheeran 2004)
<p> I'm standing on a mountain Waiting for you to come You were sitting counting The days that I had gone The note I wrote I wrapped up in a cigarette Burned away the memories I tried to forget But not yet Wishing my life away But these three words I have to say to you My baby blue You know it's true I love you I love you How can I tell you? I don't know what to say This chance that I won't miss But I miss you anyway I feel your pain It's turning me insane Thrown away I had to take the last train home
<p> But then you came Wishing my life away But these three words I have to say to you My baby blue You know it's true I love you Wishing my life away These three words I have to say to you My baby blue You know it's true You know it's true I love you I love you I love you
