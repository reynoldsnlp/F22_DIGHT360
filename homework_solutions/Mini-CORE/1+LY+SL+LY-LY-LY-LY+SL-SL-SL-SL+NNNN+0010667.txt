<p> DO YOU WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN words and music by Curly Putman & Bucky Jones recorded by T.G. Sheppard It was the [F] hottest day of August All of [Bb] of us were down by the banks of the Paint Rock [F] River I was next in line to be baptised at the innocent age of ten [C7] And Ill [F] never forget, I remember it yet The [Bb] taste of that clear, pure [F] water And that preachers words still fill my head and I [C7] hear them now and [F] then He said, Do you.. Chorus: Wanna [Bb] go to [F] heaven And I [Bb] said [F]Yeah, [C7] just lead me [F] on. Take my hand, can you [Bb] feel that [F] feelin? And [Bb] I said, [F] Yes [C] just lead me on [F] It was the hottest day of summer And our final high school dance was just about over I was old enough for the taste of love when boys turn into men And Ill never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure water But the preachers words I barely heard, as sweet Bonnie Lou gave in She said, Do you... Chorus: It was a lonely night in August She was sittin at the end of the bar when I saw her And with a little wine and an little time she would be a prize to win Now Ill never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure water But that preachers words could not be heard, when she whispered,  Come on in She said, Do you... Chorus:
