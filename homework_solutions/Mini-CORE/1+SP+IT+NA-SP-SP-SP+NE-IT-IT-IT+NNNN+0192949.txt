<p> Nicki Minaj wasn't too happy with Barbara Walters for seemingly defending Mariah Carey recently after a video of the two pop stars arguing at the "American Idol" judges' table leaked onto the Internet in late September.
<p> "Am I not good enough for you to get my side, 'cause I'm a little black girl that raps?" Nicki said during part two of her three-part E! special, "Nicki Minaj: My Truth," according to the Huffington Post , which posted a new clip on Monday.
<p> In particular, Nicki lashed out at the veteran journalist and talk show host, claiming she didn't reach out to the rap and pop star's camp for comment.
<p> "If I was J. Lo, you would've called J. Lo's camp... You wasn't even there when I was on the show, Barbara," Nicki continued, referring to an appearance she made on "The View" that she said didn't include the complete panel. "So I guess I'm not good enough, but I'm only good enough for you to tell people that I'm unpredictable when you don't f***ing know me!"
