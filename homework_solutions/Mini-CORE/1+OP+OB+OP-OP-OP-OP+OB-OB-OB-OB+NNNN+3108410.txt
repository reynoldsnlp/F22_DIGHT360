<h> A List of People who deserve the ill will of fellow prisoners
<p> A List of People : who deserve the ill will of fellow prisoners, well i was thinking it might be a good idea, I could certainly think of a few to go on the list. Obviously this list cant include people who aren't going to prison but should be there, half the government, a long list of corrupt corporations and bankers and the isreali government etc it can only include people who are actually going to prison, if you would like to nominate someone then please comment a suggested person.
<p> I especially dont like over aggressive immigrant business men who make lots of money by dubious means, ie murder and then swan off to say america, and throw their inherited artificial english manners and charms about as a means to persuade americans to believe in them.
<p> oh theres also these guys but the egyptians beat us to it by sentencing both concerned to death, good for them recognising and dealing with such mis-behaviour
<p> The murder of Suzanne Tamim , though her daliance with a much older man with lots of money didn't bode well of her character, better a younger poorer single man really.
