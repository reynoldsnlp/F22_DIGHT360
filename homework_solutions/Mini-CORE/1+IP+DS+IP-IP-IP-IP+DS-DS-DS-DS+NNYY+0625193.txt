<h> All of Us, Together
<h> Vinyl LP $12.98
<p> VINYL FORMAT. All of Us, Together is the first proper full-length from Vancouver's Teen Daze. Arriving after a prolific stretch of EPs, singles, and remixes since 2010, and recorded in the hopeful turn from spring to summer 2011, it's something of a culmination. "I'm very proud of this as my first real LP, and the statement it makes. It fully represents where I've come to as an electronic artist."
