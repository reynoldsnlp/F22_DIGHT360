<h> The stadium issue: we have to get it right
<p> Si Steers discusses the importance of FSG making a decision on the new stadium, or redevelopment of Anfield, this year -- before we are left behind by more of our rivals.
<p> It has been the single biggest issue in the recent history of Liverpool Football Club. It has held the club back for a generation as politics and finances have all prevented the club from making any kind of progress; the only outputs being rhetoric and architect drawings.
<p> Whilst our rivals have all been progressive in stadium strategy Liverpool are still looking at options. Of course, there have been mitigating factors. But after 12 months at the club I would expect FSG to be making an announcement on the stadium this year.
<p> Economics
<p> The reason the stadium solution is absolutely critical to the future of the club is simple economics. Every single season for each home game we are already losing 1m per game to United and Arsenal who both have stadiums fit for the 21st Century. In terms of capacity: Anfield is behind Old Trafford, the Emirates, City of Manchester Stadium, and even St James Park (Sports Direct Arena). Both Chelsea and Tottenham are both looking at stadium solutions; the longer we sit still, the further we will fall behind our rivals.
<p> With financial fair play coming into force it is important that we secure revenue streams that are going to enable the club to be competitive on the pitch. We have done great work on our commercial strategy: with income increasing and lucrative sponsorship deals with Standard Chartered and Warrior.
<p> But the critical challenge for the club is increasing match day revenue. Match day revenue is recurring revenue: it is money that the club is guaranteed. Sponsorship deals are a secure source of revenue, but they are contract driven and can fluctuate. Revenue that the club generates is the primary source of income.
<p> To increase our match day revenue we have to get more bums on seats. There is little room for manoeuvre on ticket prices; so it is essential that we find a solution to get more people to games. The facilities at Anfield have been upgraded in recent times; but they still do not compare to those at new grounds.
<p> Solution? Redevelop vs New Stadium
<p> So what is the solution? I have a strong view: but it is tinged with my head ruling my heart. I love Anfield; I love the match day experience. The history at Anfield seeps out of the stadium. I get goose bumps walking up Walton Breck Road every time I approach Anfield. It has a magical, mystical aura and it is the very heart of the Club's identity. Liverpool Football Club and Anfield are synonymous with each other.
<p> AFL Design of potential new LFC stadium
<p> I can understand why the Club hierarchy have looked at every single alternative of expanding and upgrading the current Anfield. The emotional pull of Anfield should be a key consideration in the stadium solution, but any solution has to be realistic, sustainable, and secure the long term future for Liverpool Football Club. I cannot see that an expansion of Anfield will deliver what the Club needs to progress in terms of infrastructure and capacity. There is also the question of regeneration: the residents of Anfield have been living under the shadow of a new stadium for over a decade.
<p> New Stadium
<p> I believe that the only solution is to build a new stadium in Stanley Park. A new 60,000 seat stadium with world class facilities will secure the future for the club for generations. It will provide the club with financial stability. And critically, it will increase the value of the club. That is the long term goal of FSG, increasing the value of the club. In fact, the sole reason Hicks and Gillette brought into Liverpool; and the reason they put such a ridiculous valuation on the club was based solely upon the stadium solution.
<p> I believe that the stadium solution can be delivered for 250m. Brighton have just moved into the Amex; a fantastic new stadium that was built at the cost of circa 100m. For Liverpool to build a new stadium in Stanley Park a key factor will be securing a naming rights partner. This is perhaps the most sensitive topic of the stadium solution. Any Liverpool stadium will always be known by Kopites as Anfield. Liverpool is a club with such a unique identity: it has struggled more than most to make the cultural transition from football club to business. The issue of naming rights will need to be managed sensitively and sensibly.
<p> If the club does eventually move from Anfield to Stanley Park I would want to see a permanent Liverpool presence on the Anfield site. Be it the club museum, or something else, I believe that Anfield should always be synonymous with Liverpool FC.
<p> The stadium solution is one of the most emotive subjects in our history; but it is also critical to our future success. We have to get it right; we cannot afford to make a mistake. And we have to move quickly. Our future success is reliant on us being competitive financially; we can no longer guarantee CL football. We need to secure the future of the club, and the stadium solution is at the heart of that objective.
<p> Staying at Anfield is another option. But with Chelsea and Tottenham looking at new stadiums, the longer we sit still, the further behind we will fall. Whatever the stadium solution; we need to find a way of keeping our identity intact and traditions that define the Club.
<p> It is FSG's biggest challenge, and if they can pull it off, they will have left a lasting legacy that will go beyond what happens on the pitch during their tenure.

<h> About Si Steers
<p> I have been a Liverpool fan since the early 80's when we were dominating both domestic and European football. I work in PR and Communications as a day job; my work deals with culture, identity and strategy so I take a keen interest in what all of those things mean to Liverpool Football Club. I wite about Liverpool FC for This is Anfield and The Tomkins Times. Find me on Twitter: @sisteers
<p> Do you think 60000 is enough, i know the money comes from the corprate seating, but maybe look to go to 70000+ seating, obviously depends on cost difference for the 10000 compared to revenue it would bring in...
<p> Desthomas2
<p> Great article, totally agree, now let's make it happen! I'm sick of hearing about it I want to see some action on it
<p> Auketas
<p> and why excactely don't you think we can rebuild anfield? i don't see any real arguments in your article but i agree that we need to get this right and we need to do it now
<p> Mattwwhatley
<p> Because there is very little room to expand the stadium and in the past there was a question surrounding the foundations underneath not being strong enough to increase the size of the stands which was why David Moores  did not expand otherwise when he owned Liverpool he would have expanded the capacity.

<p> The feasibility of redeveloping Anfield is well soccumenyes and is FSG's preferred option
<p> Peter McGurk
<p> Well documented
<p> Sisteers
<p> The arguments against redeveloping Anfield have been well documented. There is very little room around the ground for expansion. It is potentially possible to go upwards, but of the cost of redevelopment is going to come in at 150m it has to be considered whether that is value for money in comparison to a brand new stadium. Article is based on my hunch of what I think will happen, hence I haven't dwelled too much on why Anfield cannot be redeveloped.

<p> I'd go for at least 75,000 seats. We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot if we only went for 60,000. What would happen then if Man Utd and Arsenal went to expand again. Would we be left in their shadow for another 20 years. If FSG want to make an impression, they should make New Anfield the biggest club ground in the UK at 76,000 seats minimum. We really do need to harness the club's revenue and every seat will count, but so will the honour of having the biggest ground in the UK. It would give fans something to be really proud of and spur the club on to bigger and better things.
<p> Prole
<p> For me the best answer with regards naming the new stadium would be to use both the advert name combined with Anfield. For example, if it was Amex that wanted the naming rights to the new stadium, then call it the 'Amex Anfield stadium'. I understand that could be easier said than done but it's an idea.
<p> Mattwwhatley
<p> Liverpool have been given planning permission to build a stadium of upto 70000 capacity so given that Liverpool has the second largest following in Britain and one of the largest number of fans of any football club world wide we should be looking at building the stadium to the maximum capacity to start with and try to get permission from the council and government to expand in future.
<p> Masaryk Peter
<p> 75 000 seats minimary....there are around of world many fans who want to watch LFC...and also because of repaying.
<p> We need to redevelop this ground into 75,000 or 76,000 which will be enough and leave the kop untouch, 45,000 at the moment, what we do make the main stand adding 20,000 seats including the corporate boxes that will be 65,000 and both the centenary and annie road will add about 5,000 or 6,000 seats will be enough to adding revenue to the club.

<p> That stadium looks like a cross between Emirates and Wembley awful.

<p> make anfield the home of our academy and museum !!!! and build a new stadium .... that way anfield will continue to live.  a new stadium with anything short of 80,000 seats plus the box[s] will not serve us beyond 20 years max....
