<p> The nightmare terror of the slithering eye that unleashed agonizing horror on a screaming world!!!

<h> I sincerely hope that this is my last post about Sarah Palin.
<p> I'm very tired of her and am upset about how yet another bright, shiny, distracting thing has, once again, become the focus of the campaign for president of the United States.
<p> I know that everyone and his brother has been blogging about Palin, so I am not going to add much to the equation here. But this is what I wanted to point out about her, about how she apparently seems to think. She apparently thinks that rules, about most anything, are pretty arbitrary and don't apply to her. There are the well discussed issues about her time in Alaska, her abuse of power in firing people who wouldn't do what she wanted, her requesting and getting per diem payments (which are, as all government employees know, only supposed to be used when you are on travel) for her, her husband AND her kids, all while they were living at home. That amounted to several tens of thousands of dollars. Normal people would have been fired for that one.
<p> Here are a couple of recent examples from her time on the McCain/Palin ticket. Here is a story from Huffpo , where Palin was on Fox News (which speaks for itself) complaining about Katie Couric.
<p> Appearing on a friendlier news outlet, Gov. Sarah Palin said she was "annoyed" with the way Katie Couric handled their interview and complained that the CBS Evening News host failed to give her the opportunity to take a proverbial axe to Barack Obama.
<p> In a portion of her sit-down with Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron, Palin claimed that Couric's questions -- which produced a series of staggeringly embarrassing responses -- put her in a lose-lose position.
<p> "The Sarah Palin in those interviews was a little bit annoyed," she said. "It's like, man, no matter what you say, you are going to get clobbered. If you choose to answer a question, you are going to get clobbered on the answer. If you choose to try to pivot and go to another subject that you believe that Americans want to hear about, you get clobbered for that too."
<p> Yes, it was all Couric's fault, not giving her a chance to answer the questions that Palin wanted to. She felt that she should have some time to bash on Obama, and was annoyed that she felt she was put in a "lose-lose" situation for flubbing answers to really tough questions, like "What newspapers do you read?" Palin was annoyed at Couric, who was doing her job as a member of the press!
<p> This belief that the press is something to be used or ignored at will came out again in the recently concluded Vice Presidential debate. She said up front that she would probably not answer all the questions the moderator asked, or she wouldn't answer them in the way that they wanted her to answer them. Excuse me, but isn't that sort of the purpose of a debate? You get asked questions, and then you answer them. You aren't supposed to get to make up your own rules . But then, that is how Republicans are seeing the world these days. They do feel they get to make up their own rules as they go. It's as if you are on a basketball team and you tell the referees that you are no longer going to honor the rules about having to dribble the ball while running. Sarah Palin has decreed that she can just pick the ball up and run wherever she likes, and the ref can't call traveling on her, because those are the new Sarah Palin rules.
<p> This would be a very dangerous person to have even as a Vice President, who (up until the time of Dick Cheney) doesn't normally have a lot of important duties. However, given McCain's age, his four cancer surgeries and his very alarming, confused behavior he has been displaying on the campaign, Palin would be extraordinarily dangerous as President.
<p> Just think about this. Women (and many men) have been longing for the time when the United States could have a female president. Several television shows and films have depicted such a time. And it is entirely possible that the first female president could end up being Sarah Palin, a person who seems more equipped to play someone's ditzy neighbor on a 70's sitcom than to be in any position of power, much less the most powerful position on the planet.
<p> It may be very apropos that election day and Halloween are so close together.
