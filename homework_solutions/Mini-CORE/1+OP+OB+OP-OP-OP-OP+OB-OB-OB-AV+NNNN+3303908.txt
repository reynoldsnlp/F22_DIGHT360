<h> Life+Stuff: You don't have to
<p> Whatever it is that you think you have to do, you don't have to. It's that simple. Don't want to get married, have babies, go to work, wear a suit, pay tax, be a good citizen? Don't do it. You don't have to.
<p> I always thought that I would grow up, get a degree, get a job, get married, buy a house, have some babies and that would be it. But you know what? It's not happening that way.
<p> It's taken me a long time to realise that you don't have to do any of that stuff. It's much scarier to consider the vast possibilities. I can live in a rented house in the south of France. I can own an alpaca. I can go blonde, become a stripper and get a tattoo of a pin-up girl on my arm.
<h> Comments
<p> I noticed the piercing I just couldn't remember if you'd always had it? Not sure what that says about my powers of observation or my memory! I generally do what I want most of the time anyway, not that my activities are all that exciting/controversial/wild but if I set my mind to something then I just keep at it until I cross it off the list. My family are used to it now anyway. There are still a few things I want to do that are the traditional norms, and I hope to get married, have kids etc, but they are things I've always wanted to do, I don't feel like I have to do them.
<p> As you know Emma, nothing stops me. Especially when it comes to going to Hawai'i. And I love your style, drive, enthusiasm, infectious laugh, generosity and love of chocolate. You'll do superbly in life but I think you'll only be pole dancing for fun and friends, not as a career objective.
<p> I submit to you the rules I live my life by. I'm sure you and your fans can dig them.
<p> Kimo's Hawaiian Rules Never judge a day by the weather The best things in life aren't things Tell the truth -- there's less to remember Speak softly and wear a loud shirt Goals are deceptive -- the unaimed arrow never misses He who dies with the most toys -- still dies Age is relative -- when you're over the hill, you pick up speed There are two ways to be rich -- make more or desire less Beauty is internal -- looks mean nothing No Rain -- No Rainbows
