<p> Author: The W.H. shouldn't make exceptions for special cases such as Carlos Roa, an illegal immigrant who walk from Miami to D.C. to support the Dream ACT. | AP Photo Close
<p> By TOM TANCREDO | 6/24/11 6:19 AM EDT
<p> I'm the first to acknowledge that among the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, many are hardworking, law-abiding members of our society. A very small percentage were brought here by their parents, and did not choose to break the law themselves.
<p> The media endlessly reports on these hard cases to implicitly -- and sometimes explicitly -- promote bad laws, like the DREAM Act and in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.

<p> The latest of these hard cases involves the former Washington Post reporter Jose Antonio Vargas, who revealed he was an illegal immigrant in a new New York Times Magazine article .
<p> His account is compelling. Vargas is a Philippines native. His parents sent him at age 12 to live with his grandparents in the U.S., in 1993 He excelled in school, went to college and pursued a career in journalism -- eventually sharing a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings. He did not know he was here illegally until age 16, when he applied for a driver's license.
<p> By revealing himself to be an illegal immigrant, Vargas has won praise from liberal immigration advocates. A blogger for the San Francisco Chronicle called it, the "most courageous act I've seen in quite a while" -- and then calls for passage of the DREAM Act. "The bar," Noreen Malone of New York magazine argued, "just got a whole lot higher for describing personal essays as 'brave.'"
<p> Vargas writes, "I don't know what the consequences will be of telling my story."
<p> I'll be glad to tell him. There's a good chance that he will get legal status if a liberal senator writes him a private bill, or if the Obama administration grants him deferred action. I am absolutely certain that no one from Immigration and Customs Enforcement will detain him, and no immigration judge will deport him. It is already the administration policy to use "prosecutorial discretion" for illegal immigrants who could be eligible for the DREAM Act.
<p> Vargas wrote that he was inspired to go public because of four illegal immigrant college students' decision to take a high-profile walk from Miami to D.C. in support of the DREAM Act. Of course, although they were publicizing the fact that they were here illegally, no ICE agents took action against them.
<p> Every month, there seems to be a news story about a young illegal immigrant publicly flaunting illegal status. They testify before Congress, give graduation speeches, organize rallies and, in some cases, break additional laws by blocking traffic.
<p> One popular sign that illegal immigrants hold up at rallies reads "Undocumented, Unafraid" for good reason. To the best of my knowledge, not one of the dozens of illegal immigrants who publicly disclosed their status has been deported, or even detained, by the ICE.
<p> I truly sympathize with Vargas' story, but there is nothing courageous about revealing himself. The worst consequence he may face is another Pulitzer prize.
<p> Last week, I read about a less sympathetic immigrant, Pablo Bergen. Adding to his already long criminal history, Bergen was arrested as the leader of a 33-man heroin trafficking operation. Despite being in this country illegally from the Dominican Republic, he is receiving $900 a month in food stamps.
<p> But the only news story I could find about Bergen was from the Tampa ABC affiliate.
<p> Meanwhile, an informal search of Google News found more than 600 stories about Vargas
<p> Of course, most illegal immigrants are not drug-dealing. welfare abusers like Bergen. But they are also not Pulitzer Prize winning journalists, who did not even know they were coming here illegally.
<p> Almost 10 years ago, I was at the center of one these hard case controversies, when the Denver Post ran a sob story about Jesus Apodaca, an illegal immigrant honor student, who could not afford college.
<p> I found out the story had been planted by the Mexican consulate in Denver, to build support for a bill that would give illegal immigrants in-state tuition, a privilege denied U.S. citizens from other states.
<p> I contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service and asked if they planned to do anything when the name, picture and high school of a self-professed illegal immigrant was published on the cover of a major newspaper. Politicians and media went into an uproar over how insensitive I was.
<p> Ultimately, no action was taken against the Apodacas. A donor to then-Gov. Bill Owens paid for him to go to college. He is still living here without consequence.
<p> At the time, I said the Apodacas "seem like good people, people I'd be happy to have as a neighbor and friends. But it is irrelevant to the issue of whether they have broken the law."
<p> In response, a columnist at the Rocky Mountain News compared me to Inspector Jarvet from "Les Misrables," "the literary symbol of doctrinaire and unfeeling justice."
<p> Unlike the France of "Les Misrables" -- where Jean Valjean spends 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread -- our immigration laws are hardly authoritarian. We offer more legal immigration visas and more civil protections to illegal immigrants than any other country.
<p> Most illegal immigrants are not bad people. But our immigration policy must be based on what is in the best interest of all U.S. citizens. With 9 percent unemployment, a crumbling common culture, overcrowded schools and hospitals and trillion dollar deficits, we cannot afford to ignore our immigration laws -- even in the hard cases.
<p> Tom Tancredo served as a Republican congressman from Colorado 1999-2009, and was chairman of the bipartisan Immigration Reform Caucus. He now serves as chairman of Team America PAC and the Rocky Mountain Foundation.
<h> Readers' Comments (85)
<p> Of course, we must enforce our immigration laws and deport all illegal aliens not just illegal criminals but ALL. We must replace Obama because Obama is granting amnesty to illegal aliens without the consent of our Congress and Americans. Let's vote Obama and the Dems out. They are destroying our country with illegal aliens. No more Obama. His socialists policies are destroying the United States. We need a new president in the White House. NO MORE OBAMA. NO MORE DEMS.
<p> In the wake of the recent memo from the Obama administration which announced "prosecutorial discretion" in dealing with illegal aliens, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents across the country have been speaking out what many of them are calling a "backdoor amnesty."
<p> On Wednesday, ICE Union president Chris Crane told PRNewswire: "Any American concerned about immigration needs to brace themselves for what's coming. This is just one of many new ICE policies in queue aimed at stopping the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws in the United States. Unable to pass its immigration agenda through legislation, the Administration is now implementing it through agency policy."
<p> Crane continued: "ICE and the Administration have excluded our union and our agents from the entire process of developing policies, it was all kept secret from us, we found out from the newspapers. ICE worked hand-in-hand with immigrants rights groups, but excluded its own officers."
<p> Also ignored by the press, was last year's no confidence vote ICE agents gave Obama appointee, ICE director John Morton.
<p> The National ICE Council represents about 7,000 agents and support staff.
<p> Those agents, just as many American citizens are also convinced that the new policy, which gives special preference to illegal aliens who have a relative who has served in the military, those who are enrolled in any education program and even those who are pregnant or nursing is simply to a move from an unpopular president, desperate for re-election.
<p> Crane said: "The desires of foreign nationals illegally in the United States were the framework from which these policies were developed. The result is a means for every person here illegally to avoid arrest or detention, as officers we will never know who we can or cannot arrest."
<p> Perhaps, most troubling are the "secret" orders under which ICE agents are reportedly now operating.
<p> "Our officers are already under orders not to make arrests or even talk to foreign nationals in most cases unless another agency has already arrested them; you won't find that written in any public ICE policy," Crane said.
<p> Finally, this warning from the ICE Union president: "I think the writing is on the wall for every person concerned about good government and effective immigration reforms - the things happening at ICE represent neither. We are asking everyone to please email or call your Congressman and Senators immediately and ask them to help stop what's happening at ICE, we desperately need your help."
<p> Of course, the DREAM Act and so-called Comprehensive Immigration Reform (amnesty) have been defeated many times in Congress, due to public outrage.
<p> However, as Obama's poll numbers continue to slip, he has apparently once again, decided to bypass Congress this time in his pursuit of Latino votes.
<p> Anyone who follows the news to any degree must realize by now that this administration has been doing everything in its power to encourage illegal immigration and to fight against those who are trying to enforce the current immigration laws.
<p> The left-wing mob continues to claim that it is the private sector that wants illegal immigration to get cheap labor. Totally untrue.
<p> The leftists from Ted Kennedy to Obama have been pushing illegal immigration for decades to expand their voting base. That is why they fight so hard to loosen up voting rules. . What better group to court? Most don't speak English very well so they don't know much about current events, have very little idea how this country works, and they do not regard themselves as citizens of the U.S. so they couldn't care less about the long-term prospects of the country and are perfectly willling to vote for whoever is going to give them the most right now.
<p> One of the primary causes of our current economic problems is the amount of money siphoned off from taxpayers to support illegal immigrants.
<p> "Of course, most illegal immigrants are not drug-dealing. welfare abusers like Bergen. But they are also not Pulitzer Prize winning journalists, who did not even know they were coming here illegally."
<p> Most illegal immigrants are welfare abusers. We all know that their children go to our public schools for free. Many of these children receive free breakfasts and lunches at these schools. They use the e.r. for free medical care, they receive food stamps, they use our food banks. They obtain these freebies illegally. They are here illegally. They are costing us billions.
<p> Vargas seems to defy the laws of the land he has lied to for years and years. He, like other illegals, seem to want to rub Americans' noses in their absolute disregard for our laws while expecting to be treated as exceptions.
<p> My great grandparents did not come to America for a better life. It was hard, very hard for them. They came here to give their children and grandchildren a better life. As long as breaking the law is rewarded, people will do it. And not only did Vargus' parents break the law, but so did he.
<p> Perhaps because of decisions his parents made, Vargus learned to lie and cheat. Yet, in America he became a journalist, a position where truth is most important. This con man choose a profession in which he could influence the public. If he lied in his own story and slanted things to suit himself, how can we believe he ever wrote anything other than fairy tales for the publications who employed him? Who knows what lies he told about others he competed against? Regardless of how anyone feels about immigration, this is a totally unethical person in a trusted position.
<p> I am greatly offended and ashamed for what our society has become. I am angry that in America, crime pays. I am astounded that so many do not care about the many ethical, hardworking journalists who lost jobs over the last decade. I am astounded at the many who care nothing for those who work hard to get ahead and are cut out by someone willing to cheat. With stories like this in the news each day, why does anyone not lie on their resume and simply make up anything they like about their past. People like Vargas are peeing in our pool.
<p> The Hispanic nationalists have been waging a stealth campaign of "ethnic cleansing" for decades. They want to transform America into a latino nation, where hispanics are the largest single demographic. They want a country that reflects their culture, their values and traditions. They want a brown America where they feel "at home"
<p> White Americans have been literally intimidated into silence, by the thunderous screams of "racism!" every time some white American demands enforcment of immigration laws, and reducing legal immigration. White Americans, whose ancestors founded this nation, are literally too afraid to defend it against the latino conquerers who are intent on replacing the traditional country with their new dream of a latino dominated culture.
<p> The US is headed to being the first large, long established country in history conquered and occupied by aliens from a different race and culture, simply because of fear. Fear of a word.
<p> RACISM,
<p> The word that conquered and destroyed the greatest nation in history. Amazing.
<p> Look at all the psycho, fascist tea baggers!!!!! I love when they make totally subjective statements, statements which have no basis in fact, and then act like because they said it it must be the truth. Viva Obama 2012, baby. Suck it.
<p> We live in a world of limited resources, which is why we have immigration laws. With millions of foreign freeloaders and criminals here illegally to exploit U.S. taxpayers, we must enforce our immigration laws if we care about our children at all.
<p> Billions of U.S. tax dollars is given to foreigners every year when they use our emergency rooms as free health clinics, get free educations for their kids and welfare checks for their anchor babies.
<p> As a Republican student activist Tancredo spoke in support of the Vietnam War. After graduating from the University of Northern Colorado he became eligible to serve in Vietnam in June 1969. Tancredo has said he went for his physical, telling doctors he had been treated for depression, and eventually got a "1-Y" deferment.[4] Critics have noted that Tancredo's appearance before the draft board led it to rule him mentally unfit for duty due to generalized anxiety, depression, and panic disorders.

<p> Thank you Mr. Tancredo for this article. I wish we can see more like this. To start let me say that I am of Latino origin and a legal immigrant to this country. The argument that illegal immigrants are entitled to amnesty because they are in the USA and want to stay in the country is fallacious, false, and contrary to the principles upon which this nation has been founded. The USA is clearly a nation of immigrants, but it is also a nation of laws. Those braking the laws, knowingly or unknowingly, have to be prepared to accept the consequences. This is best for all. More importantly, only those borne in the USA and those legally authorized to reside, temporarily or permanently, have the right the rights to be here.
<p> I understand the main reason most people want to be here; it was my reason, too. I come from an poor and uneducated family. I came to the USA in search of access to better education opportunities and the hope for a better future for me and my posterity. I entered legally when I was 19. I came alone and followed the proper procedures to gain permanent resident status. Now I am a naturalized citizen. I respect and love this nation; I respect the ideals it stands for; I respect its laws even when I may disagree with some of them. The laws should be enforced, even our immigration laws.
<p> I believe the opposite. Vargas should be deported. What are his real motives? Showing up his accomplishments to claim that those braking the immigrations laws, knowingly or unknowingly, have the rights to be given legal status? This is wrong and also unfair to those that obey and wait.
<p> I do not believe it is an issue to brown vs. white. After all, most Latinos are actually white. Latino America has the same heritages as the USA. But I do agree with you in that the term "RACISM" has been used to trump the enforcement of the immigration and other laws. This trend emerged for political reasons; promoted mainly by white politicians and community activities. The latter because they believe they have to help those in need; the former because they want to be elected and gain access to political and socioeconomic power.
<p> The immigrant communities, have gotten the message and exploit it to their advantage. The antiamericans are the politicians who mainly white male.
