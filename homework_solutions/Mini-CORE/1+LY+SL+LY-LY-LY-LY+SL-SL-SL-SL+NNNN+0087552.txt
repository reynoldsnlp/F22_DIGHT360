<p> [Verse 2:] Let me show you where you went wrong you know that our sex took us to And fro. then you had the nerve to say you're hurt and fix your mouth to Blame the cuervo. then in me could find a compromise and I'm just like You know what you chose. I don't want to say it again but here it goes Fuck it we're just friends now where's my clothes.
