<p> Mr. Bennet Kaye, who was assistant organist with Dr. Dykes, says that the doctor would often come to the boys rehearsals before morning service and practice with them the music for the day. Sometimes he would wander off into a new melody, and all would listen with rapt attention. One day he played over an air several times. It made a great impression on Mr. Kaye, who afterwards recognized it as St. Bees, the tune which has become wedded with Cowpers hymn. It takes its name from a place where the doctor had passed many pleasant hours.
