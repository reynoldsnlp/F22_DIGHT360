<h> About the Author
<p> Steve Anderson has been teaching golf for over two decades. He is a Class-A member of the PGA of America and is classified as an A-6 golf professional, or Ateaching pro. He is also one of 43 golf professionals in the United States to have "Advanced Certification in Instruction" from the PGA of America. Of those 43, he is the only lefthander. In 2000, he was named "Teacher of the Year" by the South Florida PGA.
<p> He is the Resident Head Instructor for Left-tee Golf, the most popular web site for left handed golfers in the Internet, and is an on-line professional for PGA of America. For several years he headed up the Ken Venturi Golf Training Center on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.
<p> Anderson has had numerous instruction articles published regionally and nationally and hosted a popular golf show for the NBC affiliate in Southwest Florida. He has expert certification in club fitting from Titleist, Slazenger, Zevo, and the P.G.A. Titleist named Anderson one the "Top 100" club fitters in the U.S. In May, 2000, he reached a milestone in his career by giving his 35,000th lesson. He averages nearly 2,000 lessons a year. Anderson is a Head Teaching Professional in Ft. Myers, Florida.
<p> I have just recently completed 8 lessons with Steve Anderson and as part of his instrucution I was given his book. Steve could not be any clearer about the golf swing than he is within "On the Other Hand". This book shows you everything that is needed to build a solid golf swing. I am a 16 handicap and after being down in Flordia the last 5 weeks and studying under Steve, I have had the 2 best rounds of my career in tournaments 82 - 86 . I have no one other than Steve to thank fo that. Buy the book, and more importantly get down here and take a lesson with him !!! The great thing is that Steve's instruction follows the book word for word, so even if you don't get a chance to come down and work on your swing in person, you can be guaranteed to feel like you're "almost there" when reading his book. THANKS STEVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<p> "On The Other Hand" is a fantastic instructional manual that has helped improve my game (better than my more expensive clubs!). It seems like Steve's fundamentals are missing from many other sources of golf instruction. I am glad he decided to put them in print for everyone to read. The book is filled with effective instructions, real life adventures, and easy to follow photos (whether you are left or right handed). I am not an expert, but I think this golf book is going to be "HOT!!!"
<p> Received this book on a Monday and had to play in a tournament the very next day. After reading just the first 40 pages it became clear the mistakes I was making. Before the tournament I went to the driving range and practiced what I had read and just like that I was hitting the straightest shots I've ever hit. I can't wait to read the rest of it and watch the strokes disappear!! I applaud Steve Anderson for writing a book for lefties and I agree with him that lefties are still being left behind in the area of equipment. The golf stores around here offer very little in the way of equipment for us.
