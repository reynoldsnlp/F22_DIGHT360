<p> Firstly, there is no footage of the recent Champions league final. However there is footage from this season, and from the road to the final. I can only assume this was completed before the final took place.
<p> This is official FC Barcelona merchandise.
<p> This is in the spoken language of Spanish, however you can watch with English subtitles.
<p> The first disc is a documentary "Mes Que Un Club" (More than a club)
<p> This documentary is fantastic, it takes a look at all the great players in Barcelona history. Everybody from Simitier to Koeman is covered.
<p> However this is not just a historical retrospective, it gives a lot of insight into todays squad. Featuring interviews with most of the Barca sqaud. Eto'o, Puyol, Xavi, Deco, Ronaldinho are all interviewed. Not to mention the vast array of backstage people interviewed. Everybody from La Porta through to Rijkaard.
<p> Not to mention the number of people interviewed who used to play for Barcelona. Stoichkov etc. It is clear from about 10 minutes in that this DVD had the full support of the Barcelona staff. This doesn't feel like a fan-made documentary. It feels like the real thing, and I think this is important to point out. How many times have we seen something that looks interesting and been dissapointed because it is "unautorised"?.
<p> The way this works is they go from past to present fairly frequently, this works excellently because you never get a chance to become bored. We learn some really interesting things too. A personal favourite is when Ronaldinho reveals that Motta took him under his wing when he first arrived at the club. Ronaldinho tells how his Spanish was terrible and that Thiago Motta acted as his personal translator in the dressing room. The real insight like this makes this a truly unique documentary.
<p> There is a lot of footage on this, which is at times over-whelming. To get hold of so much incredible footage feels like christmaa. Anything you can think of is included. Black and White footage of the club, footage of the Nou Camp being built, footage from the Barcelona streets on game night and of course a fantastic amount of trickery and goals from the likes of Ronaldo, Eto'o, Maradona, Cruyff and of course Ronaldinho.
<p> Hell ,there is even footage of a young(ger) Messi in training. Which is just great to see.
<p> My only problem with this documentary is that I felt it could have gone deeper into the Catalan history, showing why the club is so important. They do explain this but I just thought it could have been done in more detail. The filmmakers obviously decided this was a football DVD and to focus on that.
<p> However with the sheer wealth of footage, interviews and behind the scenes story's I couldn't rate this anything less than a "must-have".
<p> The second disc is the special features, and they are special.
<p> "2004-2005" - This is basically a season review.
<p> "Winning the title" - Brilliant, a camera crew go behind the scenes with the team on their trip to Levante (the game which won them the league) We get great footage of them leaving, the match and even the plane ride home. The squad even sing "We are the Champions" on the flight. trust me you haven't lived until you've seen a Deco/Giuly duet. We are then treated to their arrival back home in Catalunya, where the streets are full of supporters. We follow the squad to a sold-out Camp Nou where they celebrate in style, with fireworks, champagne and fans.
<p> "Ronaldinho" - An in-depth interview with the man himself, interspersed with footage of his greatest Barca moments. Very interesting.
<p> "La Masia" - La Masia is the Barcelona training camp, and here we see what goes on inside, from the youngsters to the senior squad.
<p> This dvd is incredible. I'm sure most people were put off in the beginning by reading that it was in Spanish. However I can honestly say that I was so engrossed that I didn't even notice.
<p> I was really looking forward to this DVD, especially after reading from the previous review that you could watch in English subtitles. I've tried the disc now in three different DVD players and it just won't allow me to watch in English subtitles. I'm gutted because I can't really enjoy the DVD the same without knowing what on earth people are talking about. Someone please help!
