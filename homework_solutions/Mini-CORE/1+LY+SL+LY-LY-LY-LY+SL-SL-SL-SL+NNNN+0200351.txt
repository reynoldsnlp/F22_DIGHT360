<p> (mick ralphs) [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/mott+the+ho\\... ] It would be a pleasure just to know just a little bit moreoh oh I could grow quite fond of your acquaintance Of this I'm sure The time will open up so many doors for you and me
<p> I could spend my days in sweet surrender Knowing you the way I do Lady look at me so warm and tender Yes, it's true, happiness only shared by two, just me and you
