<h> Wanted: Woman Who Took Joy Ride on Manatee
<p> Authorities in Florida are searching for a mystery woman who hitched an illegal ride on the back of a manatee.
<p> Deputies from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office responded to a call at Fort De Soto Park Sunday afternoon after a concerned witness reported a woman riding a manatee in the waterway.
<p> Witnesses provided deputies with photographs of the woman on her joy ride and a description of her, but they were unable to locate her in the area.
<p> No manatees were believed to have been injured, but the woman could face a second  degree misdemeanor charge for disturbing the mammal, police said.
<p> The Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act states, "It is unlawful for any person at any time, by any means, or in any manner intentionally or negligently to annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any Manatee."
<p> Y'all just evil. Thanks for the laugh -- I'll be coming back for some ORIGINAL comments.

<p> dedanielson states, "I'll be coming back for some ORIGINAL comments." And yet you lack the wherewithal to see the irony of your own post. Thank YOU for the laugh.

<p> .....wow! Who cares. Go after real criminals please! Waste of tax payers money! Maybe she is a tree hugger that wanted some love from a manatee! Maybe a male mantee made the first move :-) lol

<p> I long for the America that had true freedom...before the ACLU, the Sierra Club, and the diversity worshiping freaks took over. It's ok for Obama and Holder to give automatic weapons to the drug cartels, but not to take a joy ride on a sea cow. What a joke.

<p> You held a press conference to get help finding a woman who RODE A MANATEE? Talk about a waste of time and taxpayer money!!
<p> Posted by: Jim | October 2, 2012, 8:42 pm 8:42 pm
<p> "Particularly egregious" according to the police buffon. So riding a sea cow is an extremely wicked act, but abortion, gaysex, and adulterous celebraties are ok. What a sick nation.

<p> But you can ride a sting-ray around down in the Florida keys?

<p> The woman was having fun and so was the manatee, otherwise the manatee would have just swum away. So what's the harm? People swim with dolphins all the time.

<p> He's a MANatee. And she's a WOMANitee. Seems natural to me. I think in Florida they can get married. Oh, the HUMANitee!!
<p> If that manatee didn't want to be around the woman, it would have swam away in a heartbeat with no difficulty at all. From what we can see, it looks like a beautiful moment between human and nature :)

<p> r u kidding me....manatee was fully capable of avoiding human contact...this was not a seawold ride for $$ where such encounters are ok if you pay !!!!!

<p> Do you know what the narcissistic irony to all this is? SEAWORLD and the trained veterinary keepers of the damaged jaw Killer Whale........PETA says an anonymous whistle-blower told them that Nakai was attacked by other captive, angry orcas at the park.
<p> "You can't keep three young males together in what is, for them a fishpond or a fishbowl," PETA president and co-founder Ingrid Newkirk told ABC News. "They will have nowhere to go unless they can swim through concrete when they feel aggressive towards each other."

<p> I'm sure it's meant to be a silly story, but these mammals are facing extinction within a fairly short timeframe. It is entirely appropriate for law enforcement to take this idiot woman's behavior seriously.

<p> This is stinkin news!?

<p> How is this news?????!! One animal of the same species giving a helping hand (or back in this case) to another of said same species.

<p> Too bad the manatee didn't stab her with his tusk.

<p> Hmmmmm -- which one is the manatee?
<p> Posted by: fred | October 3, 2012, 6:56 am 6:56 am
<p> This is the stupidest thing I have heard of. Wasting police resources on a woman riding a manatee? What a waste.

<p> Glad to see the Pinellas County Sheriff's office has fixed all the other issues with crime in Pinellas County and St. Pete. This is absurd waste of law enforcement resources. Way to go Pinellas County Sheriffs Department...

<p> Really? Really? You have nothing better to do then expend this amount of time and money on a second degree misdemeanor with no victim? She played with a apparently friendly wild animal. Molestation and harassment is a big leap from that. It doesn't look like she was perusing it or attempting to harm it. Go find some real criminals, or if your that worried about florida wildlife spend some more time trying to deal with all the anacondas breeding in the glades/swamps.
