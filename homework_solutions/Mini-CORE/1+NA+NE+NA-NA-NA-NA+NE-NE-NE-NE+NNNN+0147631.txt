<p> Superior Court Justice M. James ruled: '(The father's) weight loss regime is itself a full-time job. So is parenting two high-needs children. One will inevitably have to give ground to the other.'
<p> He said his decision was also based upon the man's former marijuana use and documented violent outbursts.
<p> Bad news: A doctor conducting a court-ordered assessment of his health said his size meant he couldn't keep up with his sons, aged five and six
<p> Apart: The man has not seen his sons in a year but they send him artwork, above. They went into foster care when his ex-wife suffered a mental breakdown
<p> He noted that the man, who, did not know his own strength, had never hurt his children.
<p> The man told the Ottawa Citizen : 'I can't believe the judge called me extremely overweight. The judge didn't take into account how much I had lost.'
<p> He went on: 'The only thing they have against me is my weight. I'm not too fat to be a dad. I can be a good dad. I almost ate myself to death but these days I eat really healthy meals.'
<p> The ruling comes after a doctor at the Royal Ottawa Hospital's family court clinic said he was concerned the man's size could hinder his ability to care for the boys.
<p> Working out: He claims he has lost 150 pounds since the start of the case. A video on YouTube shows him lifting weights
<p> The doctor noted in his report: 'He was short of breath or winded in simply walking short distances about the clinic and he lacks both the mobility and stamina required to keep up with young and active children.'
<p> Before the judge's ruling, the man told CTV he believes the court case has bad implications for his health.
<p> 'I am a stress eater,' he said. 'Having them in my life would cause stress, but not having them in my life would cause even more stress.'
<p> He added: 'I'm a passionate man, I love my kids, just want a single chance to be a father, that's it.'
<p> Other media outlets have reported that this man has not even SEEN his kids in over a year! Strange for a supposedly loving father, right?" He hasn't been allowed to see them. He's apparently been clean for a year+; not that marijuana is a good reason to keep kids from an otherwise good parent. I'm amazed at the people commenting on "violent outbursts"; I'd be more than a little violent towards the people who took my kids away and kept them from me for over a year, too. I've noticed people involved in children's services inexplicably expect people to react to them with complete calm & obedience to get their kids back. Which is also the drs problem; he can't handle this father ignored him and lost weight without the doctor's "advice".
<p> As an American, from the USA, I can't help but be puzzled by all the comments that clearly indicate that the person commenting failed to read the article or failed to parse its' simplistic language adequately and I am horrified that the vast majority of them are from the USA. This man's wife had custody of the children (not him), she had a mental breakdown and suffered a drug overdose, the children are "high needs" children and he has not seen them (for no apparent reason) for over a year. He is a drug user who has violent outbursts and does not know his own strength and has had altercations with the police, his wife and social services. Oh, also he is extremely overweight. The Judge determined he was not capable of giving his children the care they need for several reasons, including the limitations his current weight put on his physicality. Please, put the children first, not this selfish, violent, aggressive man. Treat the children better than he has, give them a safe place.
<p> It's possible his 'violent outbursts' mentioned near the end of the article had a bearing on the decision too. It's a real shame they couldn't have attempted to keep the family together though, by using professional carers or something.
<p> Way more to this story than what is written here. He is an habitual drug user and is violent. His wife is also a drug user. He used to run a marijuanna grow-op. He held deep hatred for the Childrens Aid Society of Ottawa and had angry outbursts at CAS workers. He also plays World of Warcraft for up to 24 hours at a time . The doctors say he hasn't followed any of their advice in how to loose weight properly and will probably gain it all back. Ironically, he vows to go on a hunger strike to prove he is serious about being a good Dad. This man does not deserve to raise his children (who he hasnt seen in over a year) and cannot physically raise them anyway. He also said he would have to bring in boarders to live with them as he cant afford to raise the kids by himself. Sorry, but I agree with the Judge in this ruling.
