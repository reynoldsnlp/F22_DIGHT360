<h> Lorrie Morgan I Guess You Had To Be There lyrics
<p> Hello,honey,how was your day Well,you're sure i a good mood tonight Oh,by the way,I was downtown this afternoon And I saw the most amazing sight Through the window of a small cafe I saw a man and a woman holdin' hands And they looked so much in love it took my breath away Can't you see it,don't you understand?
<p> Well,I guess you had to be there Yeah,you really had to be there Some things you just can't explain It's just not the same I guess you had to be there [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lorri\\... ] I just stood there my heart poundin' I couldn't move,all I could do was stare I kept rememberin' when we used to look like that Two people with so much to share They were talkin' and they were laughin' Just like we used to do every day And then he kissed her tenderly What's the matter,you don't have much to say
<p> And as I watched you with your new love I haven't seen you that happy in years We've drifted so far apart and it's hard to admit it But there's nothin' left for you here (so I guess)
<p> Well,I guess you had to be there Yeah,you really had to be there Some things you just can't explain It's just not the same I guess you had to be there
