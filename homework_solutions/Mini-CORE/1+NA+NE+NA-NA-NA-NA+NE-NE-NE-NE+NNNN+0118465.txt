<p> BERKELEY, Calif. (CBS Seattle) -- It sounds like something out of the movie "Johnny Mnemonic," but scientists have successfully been able to "hack" a brain with a device that's easily available on the open market.
<p> Researchers from the University of California and University of Oxford in Geneva figured out a way to pluck sensitive information from a person's head, such as PIN numbers and bank information.
<p> The scientists took an off-the-shelf Emotiv brain-computer interface, a device that costs around $299, which allows users to interact with their computers by thought.
<p> The scientists then sat their subjects in front of a computer screen and showed them images of banks, people, and PIN numbers. They then tracked the readings coming off of the brain, specifically the P300 signal.
<p> The P300 signal is typically given off when a person recognizes something meaningful, such as someone or something they interact with on a regular basis.
<p> Scientists that conducted the experiment found they could reduce the randomness of the images by 15 to 40 percent, giving them a better chance of guessing the correct answer.
<p> Another interesting facet about the experiments is how the P300 signal could be read for lie detection.
<p> "For this reason, a GKT based on the P300 has a promising use within interrogation protocols that enable detection of potential criminal details held by the suspect," the researchers said.
<p> However, scientists say this way of lie detection is "vulnerable to specific countermeasures," but not as many compared to a traditional lie detector.
<p> This could only be the beginning of a new form of fraud. Scientists say that a person with their guard lowered could be "easily engaged into 'mind games' that camouflage the interrogation of the user and make them more cooperative."
<p> Also, much like other household electronics, "the ever increasing quality of devices, success rates of attacks will likely improve."
