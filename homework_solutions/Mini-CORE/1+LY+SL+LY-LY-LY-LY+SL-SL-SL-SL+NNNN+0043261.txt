<p> Well I try and I try You can't forget her Can't run, can't hide When you remember Nights that won't fade away Yea fade away Well I still go crazy When you hear her name Feels like you just left today And it drives you insane But you keep holding on Yea holding on In the back of my mind You live all the time In the back of my mind In the back of my mind Every night, every day That's where you still play In the back of my mind When I close my eyes You can still touch her And I fantasize She's still your lover When I wake up I see The only place you'll be I know where you'll be [| From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/f/fleetwood-\\... |] In the back of my mind You live all the time In the back of my mind In the back of my mind Every night, every day That's where you still play In the back of my mind I remember your eyes burning bright Like we touched the summer sun I can see your shadow standing there On the streets where we used to run Remember In the back of my mind You live all the time In the back of my mind In the back of my mind Every night, every day That's where you still play In the back of my mind In the back of my mind You live all the time In the back of my mind In the back of my mind
