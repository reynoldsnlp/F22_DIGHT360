<p> I love puppets. Maybe it's because I grew up watching Sesame Street and The Muppets, but put a puppet in a show and I'm sold. Fortunately for me, Runaway Moon Theatre's upcoming show, Dream , has puppets. Unfortunately for The Marble, the play's run is too short to warrant a review, but that doesn't mean we can't do something to showcase this unique and wonderful show (yes the puppets make me biased). I sat down with Dream 's creative minds, Cathy Stubington and Zompopo Flores, to talk about the show. Based on a Mexican folktale, Dream chronicles the story of Juan, a peasant who finds himself having to account for his actions to three powerful figures. The play is set during the Mexican Day of the Dead, and is part of Puente Theatre's "Sharing the Legacy" symposium on multiculturalism in theatre. Check it out, and not just for the puppets, but because it sounds like a pretty interesting show.
<p> Why puppetry? It's something I think of as pretty cool but isn't it something a lot of people don't think of to getting into?
<p> Cathy : Yeah, it's kind of what we do. Sometimes we question it but I don't think we questioned getting into it in the first place. What do you think Zompopo?
<p> Zompopo : I think puppetry is open to the imagination, to the creativity...
<p> Cathy : Yeah, because the puppets are inanimate objects, but when the audience watches them they kind of come alive. Whether it's magic, or the puppet's spirit, or the power of the imagination of the audience, it opens up the possibility for other realities to exist, or to imagine a reality that's different than the one we're in.
<p> And how did you both get your start?
<p> Zompopo : We met in 1989 in Montreal, for the first time, and we were in a puppet show of South African folk tales, and since then we have been working in different shows together.
<p> So you obviously like working together.
<p> Cathy : Yeah! I started in puppetry when I was in high school, if you want to know - if you want to go back that far. I started to do it with friends when I was in high school, and I've just kept experimenting since then. Zompopo had a start in theatre in El Salvador. Street theatre right Zompopo?
<p> Zompopo : Yes.
<p> Cathy : When we met we realized we had a lot in common. We had a sensibility in common and an aesthetic in common and common intentions.
<p> Briefly describe the show Dream.
<p> Zompopo : The show Dream is a story about a peasant from Mexico; it's based on a folk tale. He's a hard worker and a dreamer, that's why he's a little bit distracted from what's going on because he's dreaming.
<p> Cathy : He lives an ordinary life of a peasant farmer -- he's a coffee worker on a plantation -- and he tries to support his family but he becomes obsessed with a desire for something that's beyond his reach. And then through different circumstances, he does the thing that is beyond his reach and things take an abrupt change around him.
<p> As mentioned, you've done shows involving folktales from South Africa, and this is based on a Mexican Folktale. What's the appeal of folktales from other cultures, and what are you saying about our culture using these stories, if anything at all?
<p> Cathy : Yeah well, this folktale is kind of a universal folktale, there are probably similar versions in Europe and also anywhere else in Latin America. The peasant family that Juan is a part of is probably quite typical of other parts of Central America where Zompopo's from. Zompopo has also worked on coffee plantations.
<p> Zompopo : We also found that there are many common things in every culture and we've found how interesting it is for us to work on stories from different cultures. We have worked on stories from Guatemala, from Africa, from Chile, and in some sense all the cultures are universal. We always meet in someplace where we feel we could identify with some particular part. For example, in the story of Juan, one of the things I think that happens to everybody is to dream. We all have dreams... In some sense we learn from other cultures, how similar all the cultures are.
<p> Cathy : And one of the universal themes of this story is that it's about a person who has a desire for something that he doesn't have. Sometimes we think so much about what we don't have that we forget to notice what we do have. But one of the things of Mexican culture that we find interesting is that there seems to be a kind of acceptance of death as part of the culture that's more comfortable than we generally are here in North America.
<p> So is that the significance of using the Day of the Dead as the setting, to show that contrast between Mexican culture and our own?
<p> Cathy: Yeah, there is something to learn from that that helps us to reflect on our own relationship with death.
<p> Is it safe to say the show has a sort of surreal feel to it?
<p> Cathy: For us the story is more related to the Latin American literary style that's called magical realism. In that kind of tradition, which is a cultural tradition, it can be unclear whether things are real or not real. There isn't really a distinction and also there can be a co-existence of the living and the non-living, and the past and the present can overlap and go back on each other. The way we're presenting this story, we were influenced, well I don't know if we were influenced by magical realism but it's in that style.
