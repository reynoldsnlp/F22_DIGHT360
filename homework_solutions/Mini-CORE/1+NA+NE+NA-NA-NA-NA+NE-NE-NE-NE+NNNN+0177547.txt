<p> "Many property owners have found themselves in a situation where selling a building at a loss is still better than waiting for the market to comeback," said NAI Capital agent John Manion in the statement.
<p> "This was the case of this sales transaction that closed in September. The partnership had major problems and they looked to NAI Capital to help solve them. By bringing the Sellers an all cash offer with a two week close, it prevented the loan from going into default and allowed the partnership to unwind without any more financial effects, "said Manion.
<p> $1M lease signed for Irvine clothing company
<p> Los Angeles-based Western States Technologies Inc. signed a four-year, $1 million lease with Irvine-based, global clothing manufacturer Benecci Corp. according to a release.
<p> The Benecci headquarters -- recently relocated from Anaheim -- is a 22,470-square-foot building at 1 Mason at the Irvine Spectrum and is comprised of 75 percent warehouse space and 25 percent office space.
<p> Jeff Mitchell and Trent Walker, both with Voit Real Estate Services, represented both parties in the transaction, the release said.
<p> The CVS/pharmacy was built in 2010 and sits on a 1.27-acre lot offering an 11,800-square-foot, freestanding building. The purchase price for the property represented a 5.25 percent capitalization rate, the statement said.
<p> "The sale of the Mission Village CVS represents the lowest capitalization rate for a single-tenant CVS Pharmacy in the nation for the last 4 years," said Eric P. Wohl, president of HIG NNN at Hanley Investment Group in the release. "With the decrease in Walgreens' S&P credit rating to BBB, CVS should begin to command better cap rates and pricing with their BBB+ rating."
<p> The buyer, a private investor from Pasadena, Calif., was represented by Cypress Retail Group.
<p> Pacific World Corporation, international nail and beauty care product supplier, moved its corporate headquarters from Lake Forest to Aliso Viejo on the third floor of Summit Office Campus at 75 Enterprise, Suite 300.
<p> "RREEF is a long-term owner of Summit Office Campus and has a proven track record of keeping their assets in pristine condition," said Colby Annett in a release, co-managing partner of Stream Realty Partners.
<p> "Summit Office Campus is the perfect setting for Pacific World's new corporate headquarters since the unique and creative Class A office environment will provide them with direct access and high visibility, while placing them amongst Southern California's most distinguished neighborhoods, parks, hotels, dining establishments and retail centers."
<p> Guardian Commercial Realty represented Pacific World Corporation in the transaction.
