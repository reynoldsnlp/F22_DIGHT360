<h> David Hasselhoff confirms that he was sacked from Britain's Got Talent
<p> November 29th, 2011 by Lisa McGarry.
<p> David Hasselhoff looks at home already!
<p> David Hasselhoff has confirmed that he will not be judging on Britain's Got Talent when it returns next year.
<p> Reports emerged in October that the Baywatch star had been sacked by ITV bosses, who didn't think he came across well on last year's series of the reality TV show.
<p> However no official announcements were made until the star revealed the news himself today. He wrote on his website:
<p> "So it's official. I'm not coming back to Britain's Got Talent. So if you want to see me live come check me out in Bristol as Hoff the Hook in Peter Pan XXX."
<p> "Thanks to everyone who supported me on my Britain's Got Talent days. Nothing but fond memories of the cast and crew and thanks to Simon Cowell."
<p> Comedian Michael McIntyre won't be on the panel either and announced his decision to step down as a judge recently, claiming that he wants to concentrate on his stand up tour in 2012.
<p> Reports have emerged, suggesting that former X Factor judge Dannii Minogue will replace one of the men and sources claim that the Australian star has gotten as far as sorting out timetables and dates with show bosses.
<p> However, she is continuing to deny all knowledge of the talks and tweeted:
<p> "BGT headlines -- all news to me. Planning to be back on UK TV soon so hold tight."
<p> It has also been claimed that both David Walliams and Samantha Womack are possible BGT judges and Amanda Holden confirmed this week that although she will be heavily pregnant, she is planning to attend the ITV auditions in a few months time.
