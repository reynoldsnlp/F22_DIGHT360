<p> When it comes to the so-called culture wars, Canada is more than a few election cycles ahead of the United States, but it is not completely done with such battles yet.
<p> In this country, political clashes between socially conservative and progressive values don't take place anywhere near the centre of the electoral battlefield.
<p> But they still rage inside the Conservative movement.
<p> Even within those narrower confines and with a government in their image in place on Parliament Hill, the champions of the religious right have recently been on a losing streak.
<p> There has never been a federal government caucus as dominated by social conservatives as the one that Stephen Harper leads. Yet, over his tenure, they have failed to regain an inch of ground on abortion rights and they have lost the same-sex marriage battle.
<p> Just last month, the majority of Conservative MPs who would have wanted to reopen the abortion debate were defeated by a majority in the House of Commons that included the prime minister himself.
<p> And while there has been rampant speculation that Harper would eventually use the back door to achieve what he is refusing to advance through the front door of Parliament, there is scant evidence to support that theory.
<p> The majority of the judges who currently sit on the Supreme Court are now Harper appointees. Over the past six years, he has filled five vacancies on the nine-member bench. If he had wanted to, the prime minister could have recast the Supreme Court along more social conservative lines.
<p> Instead, he opted to continue to select members of the top court on the basis of judicial merit. Moreover, on Harper's watch, Supreme Court appointees have been drawn from short lists that had been vetted by the opposition parties.
<p> On same-sex marriage, Harper fulfilled his promise to put the issue to a vote early in his days as a minority prime minister and stuck to his word to leave the matter alone since he secured a majority. When a loophole surfaced that cast doubts as to the legal validity of the Canadian-performed same-sex marriages of non-Canadians, his government endeavoured to plug it.
<p> On John Baird's watch at Foreign Affairs, Canada has become a vocal critic of countries that persecute their gay citizens.
<p> Canada has come a long way since Svend Robinson stood up in the House of Commons to become the first openly gay member of Parliament in 1988. By every indication, the clock will not be turned back.
<p> Today in Ontario, two of the leading candidates to succeed Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty -- Glen Murray and Kathleen Wynne -- are openly gay.
<p> In last spring's Alberta election, the Wildrose party saw a solid lead melt away on the heels of an outcry involving a candidate's anti-gay blog.
<p> At the last federal Conservative convention in 2011, 800 delegates crowded the Fabulous Blue Tent for a party organized by Conservative gay activists.
<p> By all indications, Canada in general is done with the culture wars. But the Conservative party in particular may not be.
<p> Even as Harper exercises iron-clad control over his government, his position on social conservative issues is a minority one within his caucus. The recent vote on abortion rights provided a graphic illustration of that reality.
<p> In the immediate future, the outcome of the American presidential election coupled with a handful of landmark victories for gay rights at the state level stand to validate the prime minister's approach to social conservatism.
<p> But the Harper decade has not been kind to Canada's religious right and some of its members are hoping that payback time will come upon his retirement.
<p> Many see Jason Kenney as a promising flag-bearer. The immigration minister shored up his social conservative credentials when he voted a few weeks ago to revisit the legal status of the fetus.
<p> The battle over Harper's succession could be a watershed moment for the Conservative party. Notwithstanding mainstream Canadian public opinion, it is not necessarily immune to the kind of fratricidal battles that have crippled the Republican Party in the United States.
