<p> It's been 24 hours and Hurricane Sandy still has the eastern seaboard in its sights. The Frankenstorm, as it has been dubbed by some, is slated to make landfall on Tuesday morning.
<p> Sandy is currently exiting the Bahamas with a minimum pressure of 970 millibars and max winds of 80 miles per hour. We can expect the Hurricane to maintain that max wind speed for the next 84 hours as it churns its way up the coast.
<p> The questions are: where will Sandy hit exactly and how bad will the damage be?
<p> We spoke yesterday about the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was pegging the Frankenstorm to come aboard at about New York City. Today, the central track of invasion has been shifted further to the south.
<p> Graphic: NHC
<p> Sandy is scheduled to land early Tuesday in the state of Delaware. By hitting further to the south, we can expect that the storm maintains the necessary 74mph winds to still be called a "hurricane". The heaviest winds would be from Delaware up to the south-central Jersey shore with heavy winds extending up to New York City. Right now, the probability of 39mph winds hitting New York City is around 43%. This will almost certainly rise as we get closer to Tuesday.

<p> The uncertainty of the storm track is smaller than it was yesterday, but is still a big deal. The Euro , which has been nailing this storm, has landfall right at about where the NHC does. Further to the north is the morning run of the GFS, which is going for a landfall around New York City. Even further to the north is the afternoon edition of the GFS , which goes to Cape Cod and cuts back across Long Island with flooding rains from DC to Maine.
<p> I'm not surprised the NHC went with the consistency of the Euro.
<p> It's wise, however, not to concentrate on the exact path of Sandy. As I mentioned yesterday, Sandy is very tightly wound and very large in size. It's difficult to see on the five-day track I posted above, but once Sandy comes aboard the dot representing the center is white. That indicates that the storm is extratropical. This means that the storm is among other things very large in scope.
<p> Tropical storm force winds from Sandy are going to be felt well away from the center of the storm. In fact, the storm looks to have tropical storm winds at least 150 miles from the center. Frankenstorm could maintain tropical storm force winds well into its trip into central western Pennsylvania.
<p> The beaches look to be specially hard hit. We can expect the major flooding up and down the coast because of the combination of heavy winds, rain, and a full moon. These are the places that are most likely to see evacuations, especially further to the south from Long Island to Virginia.
<p> The width of Sandy will also lead to widespread heavy rainfall.

<p> If the NHC central track holds, we'll be looking at 10in-plus of rain in Wilmington, Delaware, 6in-plus from Washington DC to Philadelphia, PA, and 3in and more up to New York City through early Wednesday. We could see more rain on Wednesday, especially inland.
<p> I wouldn't be surprised if the worst floods are inland where there are low-lying rivers that have a tendency to overflow. This is especially the case in interior New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
<p> One place where it might not be as bad as initially advertised is New York City. Three or even five inches of rain in New York is not going to flood the city to devastation. This is the reason why people should wary of any forecast that says this is the end of days for a particular area.
<p> Where the storm hits, it's going to be very bad. A more indirect hit will lead to harsh conditions and potential power outages, yet it probably won't be something that is the be all, end all. That said, we don't know where the direct hit will be, so it's important to take all necessary precautions.
<p> As for the non-tropical part of this storm, snow is still in the probable further away from the storm center. We could see good sized accumulations in the northern Appalachians. Minor snows could occur in western Pennsylvania and into Ohio. This part of the forecast is still very much up for grabs.
<p> Overall, we still got a big storm on our hands. The question of where Sandy will lay down its greatest rage is still up for grabs.

<p> After advising tourists against travel to the cities of Jammu and Srinagar for nearly 20 years, the Foreign Office has lifted its guidelines after a fall in violence. So, Dal Lake and part of the Valley of Kashmir, one of India's most beautiful regions, are once again open to visitors
