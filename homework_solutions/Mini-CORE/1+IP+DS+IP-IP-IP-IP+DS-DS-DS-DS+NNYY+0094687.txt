<p> 1999 was the best year for me when i started to watch the WWF/E when I was at the age of 8 yrs. old. SmackDown! was really cool at that time when they had a cool roster, awesome storylines, promos, matches, puppies (divas), and other cool things that they did. I did not watch Raw (Raw is War) at that time, so maybe I can watch it from 1997-2001. Anyway, I cannot wait to get this dvd, because it was a part of my childhood of becoming a wrestling fan in the late 1990s.
<p> In terms of an actual year, it's really hard for me to single out by year, wwhen WWF was most successful in the Attitude Era. If I really had to pick one year though, it'd have to be 1998.
<p> 1998 was a real groundbreaking year for WWE. The attention they got by having Tyson on their show really skyrocketed WWE to bigger heights then The Hulkamania Era took them. And considering how huge the company was in Hogan's heyday, that was no small feat. The momentum continued with the Taker/Kane rivalry. The summer of 98 is still to to this very day, some of the VERY BEST entertainment they provided. To top it off, that summer was headlined, main evented by four of the best the industry had and WWE were lucky to have them and thankfully, utilized them to the fullest -- Taker, Austin, Kane, Mankind, all veterans by that time who knew how to keep things rolling the right way.
<p> Hey Dave, why do you always put people down for asking questions and sharing their opinions? Why don't you have some patience and let people post what they want to post and not always have some insulting and smart a** comment for them.
<p> I have patience...but not for stupidity and lack of common sense. This has been answered a million times. Sometime before or after December 31, 2012 the situation regarding future EU released will become clear. Until then NOBODY knows, except WWE.
<p> Dave, what are you the WWEdvdnews police. Just ignore peoples posts instead of trying to argue with them and insulting them. You come off as some lonely loser who has no friends and no options in life.
<p> Now i have 2 questions for you.. Where the match listsing and what about the EU release/? Please tell us!!
<p> Dave, what are you, the WWEdvdnews police? Just ignore peoples posts instead of trying to argue with them and insulting them. You come off as some lonely loser who has no friends and no options in real life.
<p> Now i have 2 questions for you Davey boy..... Where is the match listing and what about the EU release/? Please tell us!!
<p> Remember that they also have a RAW DVD coming out in a few weeks with RAW 1000. So I am sure they will have a lot of attitude era stuff on there also. So maybe they will focus more on smackdown and PPVs on the attitude era DVD. Of course I am just speculating lol but that would be a smart move by WWE. If they put a lot of the same stuff on both the attitude era DVD and RAW 1000 then less people will buy both. I am really happy that we won't have any of those stupid a** blurs.
<p> Also for those of you thinking you're getting PG content, think again. It has been confirmed through BestBuy.com that it is in fact TV-14. So in my estimation, we'll get the good stuff we've all been hoping for. Or at least most of it.
<p> I have a feeling one of the early chapters in the documentary will discuss where the Era actually began with personalities offering their opinion. However I don't think they will conclusively answer when the Era began.
<p> I really hope that they give all of the starts credit for the success of the Era, not just the top stars. As during the time the Divas, Tag Teams and mid/lower card superstars were all really involved, and added a lot to the period. As you would often get a 'top' star facing off with in a match with a lower card personality in a completive match -- this in turn made fans invest in lots of superstars regardless of their position on the card (a point sorely missing with today's product IMO).
<p> I gotta question it's not Attitude related. But why do when they show Goldbergs run in WCW, They give him the crappy WWE Theme. But on some of the short spots involving him in the WWE, like the Rock concert on the Rocks Dvd released back in Febuary. They give him his WCW theme it doesn't make sense!
<p> I noticed that 2 in the rock dvd the segement involving the rock and gillberg goldberg comes out to his wcw theme yet in matches hes involved in wcw they dub his theme, i dont understand that, they can use his theme so what the catch here, the only reason i can think of them dubbing his theme when he is in a wcw match is they dont have the rights to use the theme but can you use the theme if it was on WWE TV!!
<p> Since SV can't provide this, I wonder if I should wair for some new European supplier or get it from Austrailia or USA. Australia DVDs and Blu Rays are PAL, aren't they?
<p> But I have heard in the past that some say PAL looks better and some say NTSC. Or someone once mentionend that the WWE US pressings would look better than the Silvervision ones. I wonder on what this depends, my DVD and Blu Ray players are european.
<p> What are your experiences with this matter (region code, pressing country and quality)?
<p> As I understand it, the footage on Blu-ray discs is stored without either PAL/NTSC, and then the player will display it in the appropriate format for your TV (i.e. if you are in Europe it will playback as PAL and the US NTSC). I have both Silver Vision releases and US ones and notice no real difference at all on DVDs.
<p> Obviously the US releases are region locked (1 for DVD & A for Blu-ray) however if you have a region free player you will have no problems, alternatively you may be able to find a 'region hack' for your current player online
<p> In regard to Australia their DVDs are a different region to the UK -- region 4, but they are PAL. And for Blu-ray they are within the region, thus those will play fine on all UK Blu-ray players.
<p> I imported all WWE UK exclusive Blu-rays (even region locked B) up to Money in the Bank 2012 and they play great on my region free Blu-ray player and quality is amazing...none of that PAL to NTSC framerate conversion like with DVD.
<p> Hey completely unrelated but dont think its been covered. Got the US edition of WWE12 today and the bonus blu ray is not region locked! Also it contains 2 complete episodes of Raw featuring The Rock. Thought id pass it along!
<p> Documentary, huh? I guess that's why Russo was on the NWO DVD. Guarantee he was brought in to do this, and they just used some extra stuff he filmed to fill out that NWO documentary. Whenever they bring in guys from outside the company, they're usually not interviewing them for just one thing. Can't be;ieve we don't have a content list yet, can't wait for this!
<p> I am very excited to purchasing the Attitude era DVD. If some of you are going to complain about it thats concern content and other things include it then you shouldn't be planning on buying it. All i know is i am fine whatever WWE puts on the Attitude era DVD. I remember those days when watched Raw every monday night and record but not the whole show. I only record it when involved Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Undertaker, DX, Mcmahon and other superstars that were my favorite. I hope they will included matches like Stone cold steve Austin vs The Undertaker the night after King of the ring 1999 where austin regain the WWE championship for a 4th time. Also, i would like to see the highest Raw episode from May 10, 1999 where they had the match between Austin, Rock and Vince vs Taker, HHH and Shane with HBK as the guest referee. If i had to pick my favorite times during the Attitude era it would be from 1998 to 1999. In 1999 is when WWE was really on top and hotter during the Monday night wars when WCW was started lose the battle from there to 2001. Can't wait the relive those moments.
<p> Seeing as Tyson was practically the launching pad for the Attitude era...makes sense to be on a DVD called "The Attitude Era".
<p> The Zamboni incident was fuel to the fire for Austin vs McMahon...why wouldn't it be on?!
<p> I can already tell lot of people are going to b******* and moaning about the content being "repeated"...and funny thing is people keep mentioning only RAW moments and matches...just so you guys know there were also PPVs and SD as well. Another added bonus is the "repeated" content will actually be unedited with no blurs...especially matches like HIAC with Foley/Taker which is a definite lock on this set.
<p> Jericho and Edge and Christian aren't exactly the first people that come to mind when I think of the Attitude Era. The company was at its most "attitudinal" just before Jericho came in. By the time E&C got their big push, the weekly shows were kind of bland actually. Good wrestling but they had definitely settled in at that point.
<p> I'm sure it will be the standard documentary (Mick Foley has stated he was interviewed for this) with matches format. I doubt they'll do any 100 countdown of moments or anything like that. One thing I would love to see on here, since it's never been released (it's on Youtube) is the segment where Terri Runnels won the Hardcore title and then lost it to Stevie Richards. Sure, it was right at the very end of the Attitude era, but it was pretty hot, and would fit in nicely on this set. As far as matches, I'm really hoping they include Undertaker vs Foley Hell in a Cell, since it will mark the very first time that match will be released on DVD or Blu-ray uncensored in the US.
<p> Thats the problem with fans and people in general today...they're pessimistic about everything, they find fault in everything instead of keeping an open mind. The content is not even out, yet your saying "the set isn't going to be as good as some hoped". Well, if thats how you think...then good luck to you...maybe you should get out of your parent's basement and step outside in the real world.
<p> Nice to see WWE embracing their past again. I can't believe they actually addressed the rating issue with a gag about puppies and grapefruits! Something tells me they're gonna go controversial again now that this campaign's over, lol.
<p> you tube?whats a youtube?ive been living in a cave for the past 10 years gotta love the internet asshats that think they can run people down cause they have a opinion that differs from theyre own may i suggest you losing your high and mighty attitude,and the fact that it has a documentary just makes me think that its gonna be a waste,they dont need a documentary just have three or four discs of matches and moments instead of a hr or two hrs of people who werent even there during the attitude era talking about theyre "memories"and "feelings" but hey im sure vincenzzzzzzo will have some holier than thou answer since hes the only person on here that has a opinion that matters
<p> Thats awesome! This for sure has the potential to be dvd of the year. I don't get why Katie Vick's pom poms are on the cover though. they were post attitude era. Maybe theres another cheerleading segmet im overlooking but im not sure
<p> Then you better grab a box of tissues now then, because I can almost bet all the money in my pocket you STILL won't be satisfied -- no matter what is on this DVD. You let yourself down. Instead of accepting something for what it is, you have to "fantasy concept" the DVD in your head, and when the listing doesn't match what you had in your head, people like you throw a temper fit.
<p> If something isn't on a DVD and you want to see it, may I suggest youtube? You have heard of that site before, correct? They have 97% of what you want to see on there.
<p> All i have to say is if this set is as top notch as it seems it could be and has a great doc and plenty of good moments with a few matches mixed in(since the attitude era was about the moments and not the matches for the most part)i think people should put there money where there mouth is everyone wants a change in wwe make this the top selling dvd and maybe they will listen and get more of an edge again if not then shut up about the current product
