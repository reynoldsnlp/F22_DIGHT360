<p> BROTHERS AND SISTAS-AH! We have been fed an undercooked shit sandwich on ciabatta this week. As our nation slips further into the Great Devaluation, remember that this is the United States of America. We have overcome worse than the bumbling ineptitude of our current government.
<p> At some point, we can undo the damage and restore Liberty, even if it takes the rest of our lives. The pro-freedom movement of conservatives and libertarians will examine its faults, sweep away what drags it down, and prove that it is the ONLY choice for guaranteeing prosperity. It doesn't seem obvious today, but the only way we lose is if we quit.
<p> Reaffirm what you know to be true and remember that nobody can take that away no matter how many how many executive orders the president makes.
<p> The weekly Friday music threads were started around 5 years ago here on RTFLC by Manwhore. When we left, we took it with us and refined it. For those not familiar with the concept, we post music consistent with the theme (or whatever we feel like posting) until we get too bored/drunk to continue.
<p> The embedded video is a playlist. As you post your links in the comments, I add them all to the playlist in the top post. Don't get put off or intimidated by some people's weird selections either. This is all about everybody, alright?
<p> It's time to revive something good. This week, let's have any of the below:
<p> 1. Music that cheers you up (you've had all day Wednesday and Thursday to mope) 2. Patriotic music 3. Music from a better time, such as the Reagan years 4. Music of finding someone or something that was thought lost 5. Whatever you want that expresses how you're doing. Perhaps someone still needs a bit of catharsis
<p> Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Kimpost, CM, and the other left-of-center members for their graciousness in victory. You guys take a lot of abuse here and you had every right to kick us while we were down but you didn't. You showed class and that is not a term I throw around lightly except to note how it's largely missing from our culture. I, for one, will not forget it. So the first song is dedicated to you infidels (wouldn't be a revival if we didn't invite the sinners to stand up and be counted):
<p> This is what we have now:
<p> The Outsiders by The Doves All These Things that I've Done by The Killers Starlight by Muse Save the Day by The Living End Shadow on the Sun by Soundgarden Audioslave The Wanderer by Johnny Cash and U2 Lithium by Nirvana

<p> Do you remember, your President Nixon? Do you remember, the bills you have to pay Or even yesterday?
<p> ...is appropriate this week.

<p> Seems odd to have the last song from a guy who, in his end, was an absolute pussy, shoved a gun in his mouth, and killed himself...

<p> A valid point and I do appreciate the chance to bathe in some irony. But the selections are based on the music, not the personal failings of the artists. Most of them are also flaming liberals (except arguably for the late Johnny Cash).
<p> The Devil has the best tunes, after all...

<p> Speaking of irony, this song always makes me feel good when I hear it. I am a Powerpop junkie....
<h> CM says:
<p> Tonight I am feeling for you Under the state of a strange land You have sacrificed much to be here There but for grace as I offer my hand Welcome home, I bid you welcome, I bid you welcome Welcome home from the bottom of my heart
<p> Out here on the edge The empire is fading by the day And the world is so weary in war Maybe we'll find that new way
<p> So welcome home, see I made a space for you now Welcome home from the bottom of our heart Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts Keep it coming now -- keep it coming now You'll find most of us here with our hearts wide open Keep it coming now -- keep on coming now Keep it coming now -- keep on coming now
<p> There's a woman with her hands trembling...Haere Mai And she sings with a mountain's memory...Haere Mai
<p> There's a cloud the full length of these isles Just playing chase with the sun And it's black and it's white and it's wild All the colours are one
<p> So welcome home, I bid you welcome, I bid you welcome Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts Welcome home, see I made a space for you now Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts From the bottom of our hearts
<p> I really do like that concept of welcoming new people as if they are already home. Most of this is filmed within 10 minutes of my house....my son's school is featured, and Dave walks past our local shops. This was released just as we moved home after nearly 5 years on the other side of the world.....so, yeah, anyway it's pretty special in this house. How do you say it -- 'That damned dust in my eye again' ;-)

<p> I'm really digging on Take A Walk by Passion Pit. It's somewhat apropos (but mostly I really like this song).
<p> Honey it's your son I think I borrowed just too much We had taxes we had bills We had a lifestyle to front And tonight I swear I'll come home And we'll make love like we're young And tomorrow you'll cook dinner For the neighbors and their kids We could rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes You'll see I am no criminal I'm down on both bad knees I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

<p> This thread's moving fast. Got the playlist updated to Santino at 9:16, but some tracks are out of order.

<p> Nice.

<p> In a similar vein, last week this won NZ Single of the Year (and Best Group, and Peoples' Choice Award, and Highest selling New Zealand Single and Highest selling New Zealand Album and Radio Airplay Record of the Year).
<p> Inspired by the vibrant culture of soul, rock and bass-heavy electronica that defined late 1990s student life in Dunedin, they began jamming in their flat at 660 Castle Street. Bedroom practices quickly became small living room concerts for friends and family, which led them to playing flat-warmings, parties and eventually local bars.
<p> Fuck, Tears For Fears, When In Rome, Rick Astley... I fear we may be blowing our load a little early. Maybe it's just because it's been a while since we've have one of these threads. I'll just chalk it up to blue balls.

<p> When I first heard this song, I thought they used some old black souls singer for the vocals and did a remix.
<p> Oh, Hell, yes. Awesome choice, Biggie. REALLY awesome, even.
<p> Nothing political about this being a better time. I am really getting into 60?s soul.

<p> Saw this guy playing support to Ryan Adams last year and was blown away. Just amazing. Acoustic set in a perfect venue. Got online the next day and bought two of his albums. This is my favourite track.....I about fell off my seat when I heard it played in Sons of Anarchy......I can play it ten times in a row and still want to hear it again....

<p> Went to bed early last night and now regretting it in the morning looking at this thread.
<p> Thank you, Thrill, for welcoming me back and repmom for remembering me. You guys are sounding a little crazy right now.
<p> I'm not too proud to admit that the sound I made when I saw pluffy post was extremely undignified for a male homo sapiens.

<p> I hear a lot of people talk shit on that song and it bugs me. It's a very deep and meaningful song. I've always liked it. Don't understand where the criticism comes from
<p> It's one of my favorites from them. Although according to Wikipedia.
<p> Filter's frontman, and founding member Richard Patrick has said that the song is about him getting drunk on an airplane, taking off all of his clothes, and fighting with the flight attendants who tried to stop him.
<p> It kind of takes away some of the deep and meaningful for me.

<p> I was so buzzed when I wrote that. My turn to be ashamed. It's a good song, but I think I laid it on a bit thick with that comment.
