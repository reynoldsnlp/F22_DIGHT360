<h> Rescued pilot whale dies near Leith after being rescued from Fife coastline
<p> A whale which was rescued after becoming stranded on a Fife beach has died further down the coast at Leith.
<p> Meanwhile, an operation is under way to remove the carcasses of 17 whales from Anstruther and Pittenweem beaches.
<p> Fife Coastguard were called to the beaches near Anstruther at around 7am on Sunday when almost 30 pilot whales were spotted on the sands.
<p> Thirteen had already died when the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) arrived. Another four died despite more than 30 volunteers trying to keep the animals wet.
<p> At around 4.30pm on Sunday, ten of the whales were re-floated in the water when the tide came in. At 9pm, the pod had left the harbour. One had found it hard to keep upright but was supported by the other whales until it balanced.
<p> The group all swam out to open water and are being monitored to make sure they head towards deeper water.
<p> Alistair Jack, from the BDMLR, said: "The whales were spotted by the Harbour Master at Leith at 7.45am this morning. They were just off the docks but they have found deeper water.
<p> "We're not 100% sure where they are now and we are asking the public to keep a close eye out for them and let us know if they see them. It might take a couple of days for them to sort themselves out.
<p> "It's been a very traumatic experience for them. I don't know if they grieve or not but they have lost a lot of their family. But fingers crossed that they will keep heading out to sea."
<p> One of the pod beached near the docks at Leith, Edinburgh and died. The rest of the group have disappeared and it is hoped they are heading for deep water.
<p> Meanwhile, post-mortems are being carried out on the beach and samples taken from the dead whales to try and determine why they became stranded.
<p> The removal operation has also started, with specialist winching equipment brought in to take the whales up the 40m cliffs before they are taken away and disposed of. Thirteen carcasses are at the bottom of the cliffs at Pittenweem and a further four at the beach at Anstruther.
<p> An adult whale weighs around two tonnes.
<p> Experts believe the whales might have come ashore in a group because of their social behaviour. Pilot whales will not leave a wounded or sick member of their school, and it is thought that the animals might have followed one such whale onto the shore and become stranded.
