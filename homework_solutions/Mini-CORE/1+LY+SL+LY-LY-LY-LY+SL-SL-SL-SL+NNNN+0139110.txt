<p> Oh, I wish I was in heaven sitting down I wish this road we were taking wasn't made for breaking down I wish these nights of pleasure and days of pain weren't so tightly bound and I wish I was in heaven sitting down.
<p> They done kept me out here on this road so long all the way back home she finally said "so long." I tried to call her on some old telephone but she's not around. And I wish I was in heaven sitting down.
<p> Oh, I wish I was in heaven sitting down I wish this road we were taking wasn't made for breaking down I wish these nights of pleasure and these days of pain weren't so tightly bound and I wish I was in heaven sitting down.
<p> I been out here so long, baby, my back and my shoulder they're tired. And my mind __________ but the wheels on this old thing, they keep turning round and round and I wish I was in heaven sitting down
<p> Oh, I wish I was in heaven sitting down I wish this road we were taking wasn't made for breaking down I wish these nights of pleasure and these days of pain weren't so tightly bound and I wish I was in heaven sitting down. oh, I wish I was in heaven sitting down. Oh, I wish I was in heaven sitting down.
