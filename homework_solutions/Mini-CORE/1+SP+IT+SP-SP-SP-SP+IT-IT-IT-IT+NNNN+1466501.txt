<h> Example: 'I'm in charge of my own destiny'
<p> The recent success enjoyed by the 30-year-old star, aka Elliot Gleave -- one of only a handful of UK artists to top both the albums and singles chart last year - hasn't arrived by accident. These are the spoils of a carefully planned, slow-burn sales assault; not calculated by his manager or his label Ministry Of Sound, but by Gleave himself.
<p> Interviewed by Music Week in a Fulham pub mere yards from his mum's house, the outspoken artist reveals just how intently he studies his popular Twitter account for market research purposes: "I look at people's profile pictures, especially if they're saying bad things. I try and build an image of who my fans are and who I still have to convert."
<p> If this careful attention to career progression sounds a little business-like, that's because it is: Gleave's sod-it-let's-all-just-get-mullered hip-hop beginnings on Mike Skinner's DIY label The Beats in 2006 taught him precisely how to best disregard the commercial potential of his talent. These days, he takes the opposite approach, with studious intensity.
<p> This week, he has released his fourth album, The Evolution Of Man, which melds thick beats with grunge guitars and even the odd flash of metal. Graham Coxon, Calvin Harris, Dirty South and Zane Lowe are all involved in its 12 tracks.
<p> It's Example's darkest, most challenging LP yet -- but, naturally, it's laced with obvious hit singles too; this is an artist exclusively, prepensely interested in growing his fanbase, not alienating listeners. He will embark on his second arena tour early next year and is already planning his subsequent step up, with a crafty/hopeful eye on a future Milton Keynes Bowl gig - and even Wembley Stadium.
<p> Gleave's pragmatic professional gameplan even extends to self-sacrifice; he admits that Mercury hasn't taken up the option of his album in the US, pointing out he just wasn't willing to commit to spending months away from his tribal fanbase in the UK and Eastern Europe. Little wonder; record sales and tour dates are mutating in size on these shores, especially after festival crowds lapped up Example's exultant stage show this summer.
<p> Here, he tells Music Week how the lion's share of his income comes from live shows, why he's no fan of '360' deals -- and why he so appreciates his unique relationship with his indie label...
<p> There was talk of grunge influences on the lyrics of your last album, but this time, there's guitars...
<p> The songs start off nice and polite and then go really nasty. When I did [title track from last album] Playing In The Shadows, I wrote it with Iain Archer on guitar and Chase & Status produced it. It made me realise I could write an album with guitarists and get in the best electronic producers.
<p> How has that approach gone down with fans?
<p> I get abuse on Twitter all day every day: "Stop fucking messing with guitar music! Leave it alone! You're shit!" But I've got the seal of approval from Ian Brown, Noel Gallagher, Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon and Kasabian. I don't really give a fuck. I don't have to win over all of my haters. I've already got enough fans.
<p> Don't you worry that those who like your big hit singles might be a bit scared by your new direction?
<p> Yeah, but it's my fourth album - I've got to take risks. The most defining thing about my music is my voice. Whether I'm singing over dubstep or trance or guitars, it's such a unique sound compared to other things on the radio.
<p> You sound like a grown man when you sing. That's quite rare on mainstream pop radio these days...
<p> Exactly. Most men sound like women. It's not even a falsetto voice - it's just their normal voices. Especially the boy bands.
<p> Where do you find most of your new fans?
<p> We convert people live. We get told that a lot: "I thought you were shit, but I saw you at V or Isle Of Wight and loved it." The best thing about festivals is that you're on a line-up with people like Noel Gallagher, The Stone Roses, Elbow, Tom Petty. I can see people in the crowd stroking their beards thinking: "Who the fuck is this prick?" But by the end of it, even if they don't like the music, they might like our drummer or guitarist or the attitude. If you hear me on the radio - my song with Calvin [Harris] or Changed The Way You Kissed Me - you might put it in the same box as David Guetta. But when you see it live, it's a real band rocking out.
<p> It's interesting you should mention 'attitude' - is that missing from some of your Top 20 chart peers?
<p> It's about how you conduct yourself. It's not about being purposefully rude, it's just about having an opinion and believing in what you do. I can honestly say that I'm a huge fan of every song I've released in the last four years. That's despite what some of my detractors may think - they probably wish I was still making hip-hop, which sold to very few people. Once you find success after being an underground artist, people automatically think what you do now is not the real you, but what I do now is more naturally me than anything I did before.
<p> How much importance do you put on ticket sales versus recorded music sales?
<p> I think my music's strong, otherwise I wouldn't put it out. But I'm also aware I'm not on a major label who are going to invest a million into selling the record. Looking at my accounts, 90% of my income came from live last year. That's where I'm going to put most of the effort in. When I write songs now, I write them for festivals or the arenas and then tweak them slightly for radio.
<p> Do Ministry support that approach?
<p> Ministry pretty much let me do what I want so long as I deliver them two or three hit singles to help shift the album. If you listen through the new album, there are 12 tracks and most of it is very dark and would never get played on Capital or Kiss. There are some scary songs on there - I mean, they're exciting songs, but they're not as palatable or easy on the ear as [earlier singles] Kickstarts or Let The Sun Come Up. But then there's moments like Say Nothing or Close Enemies that have a classic song structure. You've still got to play the game.
<p> Are you closer to your label than other artists?
<p> Definitely. The good thing is I'm a priority at Ministry, but then there's a very small team. Most decisions are made between me, my A&R [David Dollimore - Ministry label MD] and my manager. It's not like there's 12 people round the table fighting. Even the videos, the look, who's going to master and mix it - it's all pretty much decided between us. I like the fact it's a small group. There was a battle to get some songs on the album - Dave would say, "Nah, I don't like them." But at a major, they'd tell you that you weren't having them on.
<p> Do you have friends who are artists signed to other labels with whom you compare and contrast?
<p> Oh yeah. I hear stuff about majors wasting X amount of money on this, not putting enough effort into that: "They made me put this out/they made me do this collaboration/They made me remix the single." I'm in a good position where I don't give any of my live or merchandise [rights] away. I own it all, which is quite rare nowadays when everyone's in a 360. I'm kind of in charge of my own destiny.
<p> Ministry have a [non-financial] interest in things like arena shows but they don't interfere. If a major label has 10% or 20% or even 50% [participation] in your live, they want a big say in what you do. Ministry are very careful spenders, I think we run a really good business - we could go on Dragon's Den! With everyone else having No.1 albums, No.1 singles or playing arenas, there are many more fingers taking pieces of the pie - and there are a lot more people who want to be involved in decisions. With us, there's three people. I love it like that.
<p> Are your fellow artists a bit jealous of your setup?
<p> If they are, they haven't told me. But I can imagine it must be quite frustrating to get a sponsorship deal with a clothing brand and give away 20% or 30% [to your label]. That can't be a good feeling. I don't do many sponsorship deals.
<p> You've worked with Adidas, I think...
<p> I'll work with Adidas because I wear Adidas. Whereas when other people have come to me and offered me a load of money, I've said no because I don't like the product. The whole Nandos thing came about because I mentioned them on my first album. Now people associate me with Nandos; I get free Nandos, Nandos are happy. It's a natural thing. Kids are savvy nowadays. They know all about advertising, marketing and branding - they learn it in schools.
<p> A well-known company recently approached me - let's say their product is worth 5,000 - and said, "We'll give you this for free if you write about it on Twitter, and you have to mention the specific product code." I said no, then they came back and said they'd give me 15,000 plus the product. Then they doubled their offer again. I said no: "I can't be bought, I don't like your product and I don't need your money."
<p> It winds me up when people say I'm a sell-out just because I've had a few chart hits. I'm the least sell-out of everyone. I've turned down so many ridiculous offers of money to do features on people's records or promote someone's brand or product. I've got the most integrity out of everyone [laughs].
<p> Does your deal with Ministry help with that - some people might try and grab as much as they can knowing careers often only last a couple of years...
<p> I feel so in control of my career at the moment. Look at some of the people on Syco: if you fall out of favour with the label, they can finish you. If [your label] manages you and puts out your records, you're out in the cold. They own everything you stand for: all your records, songwriting, image rights. That's why these people are the biggest thing ever after X Factor, then a year or two later someone at their record label decides they don't want anything to do with them, fuck them off and they're gone.
<p> When you come from an underground background, which I did, you learn industry stuff the hard way. The countless amount of times you spend delivering your records by hand to shops or radio or drive yourself to gigs, or create your own artwork, or book your gigs, or sell your own records... even though it's on a much smaller scale than the real thing, you learn the ropes. By the time I signed to Ministry, I'd already played gigs - when I had my first No.1, I'd done 2,500 shows.
<p> You sound like someone who might want to go into management at some point...
<p> Trust me, I haven't got the patience. I wouldn't want to deal with me.
<p> Your last three albums aren't on Spotify. What are your thoughts on that?
<p> It's not my decision. My label don't want my albums on Spotify - I can't really argue with that. Unfortunately there isn't a clause for me to say yes or no either way.
<p> You don't seem particularly bothered by it.
<p> I'm not. It's not affecting me. I might get a request once a week asking why I'm not on Spotify, but I don't get enough to go on about it. From what I understand they take people's subscription money and don't give any of it back to the artist.
<p> I?think that's got more to do with certain artists' relationship with their labels than Spotify...
<p> Well they should probably treat everyone equally.
<p> Mike Skinner was on the front of the NME the other week. Do you still talk - and are you thankful for your time on The Beats? Do mistakes that might have been made rankle you at all?
<p> I loved that period because I didn't have a fucking clue what I was doing. I'm not sure Mike had a fucking clue what he was doing either, certainly in terms of running the label. As I signed to him, he was the biggest thing in Britain, and then as my album came out, he was just beginning his fall from grace.
<p> I remember he said to me just before The Beats finished, "Don't ever talk about how famous you are or how much money you have." I learnt quite a bit from Mike. He taught me songwriting, structures, concepts, pacing - on a creative level he was quite helpful. But [The Beats] was kind of a free-for-all; be who you want to be, do what you want to do. No-one ever turned round to me and said: "Get your hair cut," even though I should, or told me not to wear shit hoodies. But it was a laugh.
<p> Pro Green had just come from being a battle champion, I'd come straight from a job in TV - I didn't even want to be a musician, I wanted to be a film director. But if The Streets says "come and tour", you think, "Fuck it. Even if in two years it's been the worst experience ever, you're going away with The Streets to have a laugh." And it was a laugh: we all went fucking mad.
<p> During that time, I saw a different side to the industry and, almost like a businessman, I started to realise there was a place for me. I realised I was quite unique in the marketplace. It wasn't that I didn't want to do hip-hop, I just wanted to work with some different producers. I experimented with house and dubstep producers, and everyone kept saying: "There's no-one singing and rapping over dubstep."
<p> All through that early period, I got to meet Chase & Status and Sub Focus who shaped my second album. And then I hooked up with Metrophonic, which was a great move from Dave at Ministry - it helped my songwriting no end. Before then I'd never written a chorus. You know, the first time I sung in my life was in 2009. Mad, really.
