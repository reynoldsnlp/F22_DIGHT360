<h> Even If I Wanted To Lyrics
<h> Gloriana
<p> I believed in us, baby I believed in this love From we would always be together I would always be the only one You said I'd never be lonely Now here I am all alone I let you take me from 'This is forever' To 'That's just the way love goes' And breakin' up's the best thing we'll ever do Couldn't go back even if I wanted to Right now we're broken down, baby Neither one of us wants to be Somebody else's maybe Makin' up's the best thing we'll never do Your words, I still remember you Breakin' it to me, goin' right through me I couldn't go back even if I wanted to Said I've been gettin' all your messages You're beggin' me to call you up How you were wrong about it And all you think about is How you can't quit thinkin' 'bout us And I been lyin' here cryin', baby Goin' back and forth all night From 'I can't live without ya' To 'Better off without ya' I keep comin' back to 'You were right' Breakin' up's the best thing we'll ever do Couldn't go back even if I wanted to Right now, we're broken down, baby Neither one of us wants to be Somebody else's maybe Makin' up's the best thing we'll never do Your words, I still remember you Breakin' it to me, goin' right through me I couldn't go back even if I wanted to Even if I wanted to Your words Your words goin' right through me Your words Your words goin' right through me Breakin' up's the best thing we'll ever do Breakin' up's the best thing we'll ever do Breakin' up, yeah Breakin' up, yeah Breakin' up's the best thing we'll ever do Couldn't go back even if I wanted to Right now we're broken down, baby Neither one of us wants to be Somebody else's maybe Makin' up's the best thing we'll never do Your words, I just wanna thank you for Breakin' it to me, goin' right through me I couldn't go back even if I wanted to Even if I wanted to, yeah So breakin' up, it's the best thing we'll ever do
