<h> The probe that led to Gen Petraeus' affair being exposed reportedly began with a complaint at emails allegedly by his biographer.
<p> The FBI investigation that led to the discovery of CIA boss David Petraeus' affair and resignation was reportedly triggered by "harassing" emails allegedly sent by 'lover' Paula Broadwell to another woman.
<p> The receiver of the emails went to the FBI for protection and to help track down the sender, said the Washington Post.
<p> A US official told the Associated Press the FBI's investigation began several months ago with a complaint against Ms Broadwell, who is Gen Petraeus' biographer.
<p> That inquiry reportedly led agents to her email account, which uncovered the alleged relationship with the 60-year-old retired four-star general, who earned acclaim for his leadership of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
<p> Amid concerns the emails he exchanged with Ms Broadwell, 40, raised the possibility of a security breach, the FBI brought the matter up with Gen Petraeus directly, according to the official.
<p> The FBI was also alerted that Ms Broadwell may have had access to his personal email account, said Fox News.
<p> The agency then apparently determined she allegedly had emailed a number of government workers.

<p> It was at one point trying to establish whether any of the employees were being stalked, sources told Fox.
<p> The person who complained about Ms Broadwell's purported harassing messages was not a family member nor a government official, the network added.
