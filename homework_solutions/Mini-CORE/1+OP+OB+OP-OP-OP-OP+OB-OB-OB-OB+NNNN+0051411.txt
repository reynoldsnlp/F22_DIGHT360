<h> 10 Action Movie Characters Every Guy Wishes He Could Be
<p> It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter how successful and happy with life you are. The fact of the matter is that you are destined to at one time or another have the "grass is greener on the other side of the fence" envious feeling. It's a natural feeling to have. We all want to obtain that which we don't have and we all want to be that which we are not. Every one of us has watched a movie and thought to ourselves, "I really wish I could be that guy for a day".
<p> Truthfully, there is no reason we shouldn't be having these thoughts. Movies are meant to be escapism for life, striving to both entertain and have the audience get lost inside the world the movie is depicting. For the most part movies of today, action ones in particular, are designed to make the over the top and impossible seem realistic. In doing so, the personality traits of these characters are pushed to the extreme limits of believability. Even though we as an audience know what we are seeing is not likely something that could ever really happen, we still catch ourselves wishing it could.
<p> These moments happen at different times for everyone and involve different character types depending on the personal preference of the viewer.  However sometimes there are no disputes. Anyone who sees these movie characters, no matter what their lot in life is, wishes they could be these iconic action movie personas.
<p> Now before we get started, it has to be noted that any and all superheroes are not eligible for this list. The reason for that is a simple one: they are too obvious. We all want to be them, case closed.
<p> So with that said, here are the 10 action movie characters every guy wishes he could be.
