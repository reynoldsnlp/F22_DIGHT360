<p> This is the extraordinary love story of Clare and Henry who met when Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-two and Henry thirty. Impossible but true, because Henry suffers from a rare condition where his genetic clock periodically resets and he finds himself pulled suddenly into his past or future. In the face of this force they can neither prevent nor control, Henry and Clare's struggle to lead normal lives is both intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.

<h> Review
<p> "Niffenegger exploits the possibilities of her fantasy scenario with immense skill: no wonder this novel has spent weeks on the bestseller lists in the US. This is one of those books that makes you want to eat it up from start to finish"-- The Guardian
<p> "Pick up Niffenegger's book and you'll experience a visceral thrill that only a few novels provide - an elegy to love and loss."-- Independent on Sunday
<p> "Magical - memorable... poignant, amusing and intensely moving portrait of a unique relationship - quirky, romantic, and kept the right side of cute"-- Mail on Sunday
<p> At first glance, this book might seem like a gimmick book - the idea of a man who time travels to various parts of his own, his wife's, and other's lifetimes seems like a plot gimmick that won't hold up beyond the first chapter, but it's not! In fact, the whole time-travelling thing is just a vehicle for one of the most moving, tragic love stories I have read in quite a while.
<p> The Time Traveler's Wife tells the intruiging story of Clare and Henry, who meet when Claire is 6 and Henry is 36 but marry when Claire is 20 and Henry 28. It describes in dramatic detail, their unusual meeting, and their lives together and not. Their story is full of up and downs - Clare can never be sure when Henry will disappear next, where to, or when he will come back. This adds a certain fleetingness and intensity to their relationship, particularily the earlier parts. As the book continues, it adds more flesh and detail to the two central characters; their friends, family, and relationships before and after they met each other. This ensures that the characters are well developed and described - not just reflections of each other.
<p> This book is beautifully written, poignant and incredibly moving - I would recommend it highly.
<p> Bought this after browsing through people's book lists on this site (a great place to find new books!) and finally started reading it yesterday. And finished reading it. It's a massive book so that should give an indication of how much I enjoyed it!
<p> Reading other reviews here should have already given you an idea of the story's content, so I suggest you do what I did and just buy it. I tried not to let myself be too influenced by the reviews here, other than by being convinced that I would enjoy it - and I was right. I really, really enjoyed it and read it on the outward and return journeys on the train (3 hours each way).
<p> The story is highly original and told from the points of view of Clare and Henry at different points in their lives. This is quite confusing at times but you soon get used to it. What's different and intricate is that you're reading the story out of synch, because Henry can exist in different times as he time travels through his own history. This in itself makes for an intriguing read.
<p> But for me - the crux of the story is about love. Call me an old (young actually) romantic but I just loved this aspect of the story. Before you assume anything, I'm not your typical chick-lit reader - in fact I avoid it like the plague - but this is not typical chick-lit. It's so moving and beautifully told that I had to try not to cry on the train, and spent a long time thinking about it after I'd finished.
<p> I know this review doesn't really say much about the plot but that's because I really think you should buy it and read it with an open mind. Prepare to be entertained - you'll laugh, wonder, and probably cry.
<p> I've never written a review before but felt that I just had to comment on this wonderful book.
<p> This book moved me so much - I laughed and cried. I can't remember the last book that affected me so much. This is a huge book, both in terms of length and themes. It is a beautifully crafted elegy to love, longing and absence. The time travelling concept takes a little getting used to but this is what gives the novel its unique charm. I'm not a sci-fi fan at all but the author handles it with a lightness of touch. It is essentially a love story with a difference. Henry and Clare's relationship is portrayed so compassionately without ever being maudlin. The bitter sweet ending left me in floods of tears - it was as if Henry and Clare were people I knew. There have been a lot of comparisons to "The Lovely Bones". I loved that book too but "The Time Traveler's Wife" is still with me five days after finishing it. It is so rare to find a novel that is original, well written and unafraid of taking on some big themes. The only problem I have now is finding another book to match it!
