<h> Reality Used To Be A Friend Of Mine Lyrics
<p> ( chorus ) Reality used to be a friend of mine Reality used to be a friend of mine Maybe "why? " is the question that's on you mind But reality used to be a friend of mine Reality used to be a friend of mine. Reality used to be a friend of mine Please don't ask me 'cause I don't know why, But reality used to be a friend of mine.
<p> I used to be friends with reality She used to be a pal real close to me But she tried to hide from me what was in store Tried to house me but a house has doors I was insane and the picture was crazy So the relevance here seems to be a bit hazy But I tried to explain this in the simplest terms But she let the cross burn and it was my turn to say, "the roses are red, and violets are blue,j And things are gonna stay that way, too" And I was the nut to believe all of this I figured life would just hand me bliss Now I have to worry about certain doom Or will I be here tomorrow afternoon Now ask me about the future.
<p> ( chorus ) [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pm+dawn/rea\\... ] I remember sandy gave me a hand. Now I'm known as the maniac man Looking and searching for a shred of proof Knowing any time this world could go poof Now what might happen without me knowin' That's why I find myself always tip-tip toeing She tried to let prophecy sneak yp on me But I woke up, I told her "yo step off me" What you wnat me to do? You want me to sweat blood, And hang up on your strings like a marionette does? Go to the pm on the dock of the bay, sit You need a clue. go back to the basics. She needs to learn her abc's Her and I sail on different seas. She sees different from what I sees. {do you believe? hell no}
<p> ( chorus )
<p> I lost touch with reality. I keep it as far as I can from prince be I just didn't run with the way she flowed, To where I just said "yo, I gots to go" But my heart wasn't I'll or mad at her I just chose to laugh at her And disragard everything she tells me Believe in her and she's happy and healthy What is real, a posotive plane Reality and life are no the same As to her equivalent to what is real She doesn't appeal to how I feel Maybe I should try transchanneling her {prince, you're taking this trip to far} Ok, fine, nevermind But reality used to be a friend of min
