<p> "I want to scream from the rooftops 'I'm ready to take action!'" - Kimanzi Constable SYMPHONY is a manifesto of purpose. It highlights how we all want to make an impact in the world and change it. Join the movement and act on your dreams now!
<h> That Moment When You Decide to Do Something Awesome
<p> It's hard to believe that I've already been at this blogging thing for 4 months...but sometimes hard to believe it's only been that long.
<p> Writing just feels right. It works for me and it allows me to share ideas I've had cooped up for years. Pretty incredible that there's actually people who choose to listen too.
<p> And, in order to insure that I'm doing this for the right reasons and for the right WHY, I've decided to join Jim Woods on his quest for WritersUnite.
<p> This will take place during the whole month of October and will allow us to focus on what really matters when it comes to writing. For me, that is a few key things and they are:
<p> Write a manifesto (that will be my new free download)
<p> Hone my writing theme and topics
<p> Seek out guest post opportunities to connect with other writers
<p> So with that, you will see a lot less of me here for this month. I will continue to communicate via email and want you to communicate any needs with me, as always.
<p> My major goal with this is to remember my WHY. I started this for a reason and it seems to have gotten a bit lost in the process. By the end of this month (and into next), you will have a much better understanding of what I'm about, why I do what I do, and how you can get involved with the movement.
<p> If you're a writer or blogger and are interested in joining, I encourage you to do so. Visit UnknownJim.com/revolution for details.
<p> I think #2 is essential for any writer/blogger to know and remember. When it comes to blogging being more narrow than broad in our topics is a must. Keep at it bro, your doing a great job!

<p> Definitely so. Thanks for the encouragement!

<p> Jared, I've been meaning to write a Manifesto myself. I started one but I have to finish. I plan to finish by the end of the year. . I myself have been blogging for over a year now, and I've made some strides. It's all about going at it a bit every day. Keep up the good work.
