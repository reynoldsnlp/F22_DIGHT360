<p> When a girl reach the age of eighteen She begins to think she's grown That's the kind of little girl You can never find at home
<p> Come and see me early in the morning Just about the break of day Do you want to see me hug my pillow Where my baby used to lay?
<p> One drink of wine And two drinks of gin A pretty, young girl put me In the shape I'm in
<p> Come and see me early in the morning Just about the break of day Lord, you want to see me hug my pillow Where my baby used to lay? [- From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/e/eric-clapt\\... -]
<p> I pass by the juke joint I peek through the door She's doing the boogie-woogie In the middle of the floor
<p> Come and see me early in the morning Just about the break of day Do you really want to see me hug my pillow Where my baby used to lay?
<p> See, when a girl reach the age of eighteen She begins to think she's grown And that's the kind of little girl You will never find at home
<p> Come and see me early in the morning Just about the break of day Do you want to see me hug my pillow Where my baby used to lay?
