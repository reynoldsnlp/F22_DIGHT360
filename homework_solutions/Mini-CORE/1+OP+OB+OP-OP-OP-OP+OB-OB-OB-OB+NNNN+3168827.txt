<p> Two women from the Dominican Republic told The Daily Caller that Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez paid them for sex earlier this year. In interviews, the two women said they met Menendez around Easter at Casa de Campo, an expensive 7,000 acre resort in the Dominican Republic. They claimed Menendez agreed to pay them $500 for sex acts, but in the end they each received only $100.
<p> The women spoke through a translator in the company of their attorney, Melanio Figueroa. Both asked that their identities remain obscured for fear of reprisals in the Dominican Republic. When shown a photograph of Sen. Menendez, the women said they recognized him as the man with whom they'd had sexual relations at Casa de Campo this spring. Both said they were brought to the resort with the understanding they would be paid for sex. Neither knew the identity of the man at the time. Both claimed to recognize him later as Sen. Menendez.
<p> "He called him[self] 'Bob,'" said one. One woman said Menendez wooed her with compliments like "beautiful" before they slept together. The other woman recounted, with apparent bitterness, receiving from an intermediary only $100 of the $500 she had been promised. "He lies," she said of Menendez. "He says one thing and does another." According to the translator's summary, Menendez "was nice at first, but then later he did not seem to care about her."
<p> Menendez, who is 58 and divorced, has represented New Jersey in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat since being appointed to fill a vacancy in 2005. He is up for re-election on Nov. 6
<p> In the latest October surprise, two unidentified women from the Dominican Republic are accusing Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez of paying them for sex earlier this year, The Daily Caller reports . The two women spoke on camera with their faces obscured through a translator, with their attorney present. The prostitutes are alleging that Menendez agreed to pay them $500 for sex, but he only gave them $100.
<p> Even die-hard right-wing loon host of MSNBC's The Cycle S.E. Cupp believes this is a non-scandal:
<p> Sorry, Drudge. Not interested in the Menendez scandal. NJ needs our help right now, and there are more important stories before election. -- S.E. Cupp (@secupp) November 1, 2012
<p> That's odd. He's so generous with spending your money -- just not his own.
<p> And until CREDIBLE news sources report on this (such as HuffPo, CNN, MSNBC, TPM, NBC News, Yahoo!), this is just another right-wing bogus story perpetrated by the likes of Dana Loesch, The Daily Caller, The Blaze, FreeRepublic, HotAir, Drudge, NewsMax, and the whole RWNJ/#TCOT Media apparatus. And even if they did, it would be seen as a RWNJ hackjob.
<p> Adam Weinstein at Mother Jones has called out The Daily Caller on their role in the non-scandal on Twitter :
