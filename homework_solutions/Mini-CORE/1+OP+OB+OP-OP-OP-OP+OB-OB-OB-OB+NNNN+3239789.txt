<h> Less Politeness, More Forthrightness
<p> Watch out -- the Federal Observer brings you another thought provoking rant from a member of its Granny Brigade. Maybe that is the problem in this nation -- let's turn it over to the Grannys and let them straighten it all out. (JB)
<p> What happens when you yell and scream and finally get the attention of the law makers and lo and behold actually get a bill passed into law that will help save this country?
<p> Are you ready to do your part to make it work?
<p> Evidently not the people in Georgia! Or I suspect anywhere.... Headlines scream Farms falling into ruin... no workers? Well duhhhhhhhhh.....
<p> WHY?
<p> New immigration laws working too well? Crops sitting in the fields rotting not in the packing houses being shipped. Farmers losing their income, people losing their groceries!
<p> Oh yes we want to send the illegals home and save all of those empty dollars we give them every day, stop all the medical costs, all the housing etc... I yelled as much as anyone and know it is the right thing to do but are you ready for the results?
<p> We Americans have no intention of lowering ourselves to go into the fields like a wetback or migrant or what ever you want to call them... We want the products, the farmer wants the produce to sell, and the merchants need the produce but how do you get them without breaking a sweat or getting a little dirt under those manicured nails?
<p> Cut off the welfare and food stamps to the Americans... let them earn their keep for a change also.. it is not just the illegals smothering us all with their laziness and worthlessness. It isn't just the blacks it isn't just the foreigners there are just as many white bums out there as any race creed or color.... In all it is a American Problem... Too many hand outs, too many liberal voters, too many nanny state promoters.. well someone has to make that nanny state available and who better than the people who do have a backbone and are trying to take care of themselves.. The middle class has become the foster parents to the lazy, incompetent and brain dead, crack showing idiots that we just allow to take and take and take from us.
<p> As long as there are jobs of any kind, any pay scale, there should be no welfare, no help what so ever. Let the over weight bloated couch potatoes get off their butts and learn how to work for a change or starve. Have you noticed at the grocery stores that 90% of the food stamp users are hugely over weight? If they had to work for those food stamp dollars I bet some of that blubber would come off.
<p> You yell and scream moan and groan about no jobs yet there are thousands of them out there waiting for someone who really wants to work not just talk about it.
<p> Actually there aren't very many Americans that could do the work, maybe a little each day but to put in a full day of actual work? Not going to be easy and the Americans I know want everything easy. Clean... Quick... without effort just push a button or flick a switch.
<p> Well folks the time has come.. you will have to put your petty pride and laziness aside and get out and start doing what your ancestors did and learn to do it well. Hell no you had rather make minimum wage at McDonald's rather than get a good tan, build muscles and get healthy. You had rather sit in the air conditioning and punch little buttons on the cash registers or dump tons of potatoes into that nasty grease.
<p> Instead of buying your kids new IPODS etc drive them out to the farm and tell them to earn it.. Oh I know how lazy they are but if you are persistent and can find a farmer willing to put up with their whining and BS they may just learn the value of a dollar and respect you a little more. They would respect you allot more if you started being a parent instead of a friend also.. that means whacking a butt here and there when they are out of line.. not allowing the disrespect and demanding of a spoiled ingrate. that requires you to be a sensible adult also, one with respect for yourself and your country.
<p> Can you do that?
<p> People hate to hear "When I was a kid" etc but never the less when I was a kid every one of us knew that come the summer time we would have to bust our butts to get the things we wanted. We always had free time but also had jobs to do around the house, help in the garden, help in the kitchen, work in tobacco, pull weeds, string beans, peal apples, all to just make sure we ate the next winter.. Then we could also work for money when needed to pick berries, tomatoes, peppers, apples all by the basket.. I paid for all of my school clothes by the time I was 14 years old and I had nice clothes. I took care of them because I had worked so hard to get them.
<p> Where is our pride? Where is our desire to do things for ourselves?
<p> Had you rather stand in a line and get your free food stamps, your WIC cards, your welfare check, wow that is really hard work.. keeping your pride and dignity while standing in those lines with those judgmental government workers looking at your every secret. Judging you with their 9th grade education. ( It doesn't matter if they graduated with a masters they still only have a 9th grade education compared to what it should have been)
<p> Farmers will have to learn to farm the old ways too, give up those million dollar tractors, go back to the ones with no air conditioning, no stereos, just the functional equipment to get the job done. Can you imagine paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a harvester to use just once a year? How was it done in the past? Someone needs to start looking backwards.
<p> Folks with the devastation of our marketing farm products will come a better future.. Maybe we can get Monsanto out of farming along with the USDA and go back to the smaller family farms where the family works the land and profits from it for themselves not to support the corporations. It can be done.. It will just take some bravery and determination along with a big serving of PRIDE in yourselves.. Pride in your work,,,, Pride in your home and family. Pride in your country.
