<h> Brown coal generators come back to the table
<p> Negotiations between the federal government and brown coal generators for their closure are set to restart after changes to the carbon price scheme.
<p> Negotiations stalled earlier this year after the low international price of carbon caused power companies to revise up the value of their generation assets because it extended their likely lifespan. As a result, the talks were put on hold pending the resolution of the future of the price floor from 2015 and what access companies would have to international carbon markets.
<p> On Tuesday, Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said the government would endeavour to announce an outcome "shortly".
<p> As part of the carbon price package announced last year, the government agreed to negotiate by June 20 the closure of 2000 megawatts of highly emissions-intensive generation capacity by 2020. The government is negotiating with five generators: Playford B in South Australia, Energy Brix, Hazelwood and Yallourn in Victoria and Collinsville in Queensland.
<p> Companies involved in the negotiations declined to comment on the progress of the negotiations.
<p> Environment Victoria campaigns director Mark Wakeham said it was time for the government to deliver on the last remaining plank of the Clean Energy Future package.
<p> "Now the floor price issue has been resolved there should be no impediment to getting to the pointy end of the negotiations," he said.
<p> "Depending on what happens with the EU permit price, the generators may be better off from 2015 to 2018 without a floor price, but the restriction on cheap CDM certificates is likely to have a much larger impact on the generators' carbon liability and the value of their assets."
