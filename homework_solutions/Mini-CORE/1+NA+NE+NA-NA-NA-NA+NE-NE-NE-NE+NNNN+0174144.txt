<h> Next Two Debates Likely to Be Nasty
<p> In a political year when debates have repeatedly reshaped the course of the Republican presidential campaign, the next two televised gatherings of candidates, on Saturday and next Thursday, are shaping up to be the most important -- and nasty -- yet.
<p> Both come just weeks before voting is set to begin in Iowa on Jan. 3, followed quickly by primaries in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. And both debates are likely to be slugfests as desperate candidates search for a magic bullet to improve their political fortunes in the short time that is left.
<p> The best predictors for the tenor of a presidential debate are the hours and days that precede it. The rhetoric on the stump and in campaign ads usually previews the way the candidates will interact with each other and with the debate moderators when they step onto the stage.
<p> And the 2012 campaign for the Republican nomination has suddenly taken on a much harsher tone.
<p> On Thursday, a so-called super PAC affiliated with Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, released -- then quickly pulled back -- a 60-second TV ad blasting the record and character of Mr. Romney's new chief rival in the contest, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House.
<p> The ad, which the group later said was unfinished, declared that Mr. Gingrich had "a ton of baggage": fines for ethics violations, payments for work on behalf of Freddie Mac and health insurance companies, a controversial position on immigration and support for an individual mandate. And, perhaps worst of all in the eyes of many conservatives: "Gingrich even teamed up with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming."
<p> The group, which is run by associates of Mr. Romney's but by law cannot coordinate its attacks with Mr. Romney's campaign, managed to inject the ad into the political conversation just in time for Saturday's debate, essentially ensuring it will be talked about without spending a dime.
<p> Mr. Romney has been waging a cautious campaign, being careful not to attack his rivals too directly. But Mr. Gingrich's recent surge in the polls forced the campaign to shift into a new, more aggressive phase. Thursday morning, two prominent supporters of Mr. Romney accused Mr. Gingrich of "self-aggrandizement" in his reaction to the Republican budget plan this year.
<p> "To undercut Paul Ryan, is the most self-serving, anticonservative thing one can imagine happening," John Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, told reporters.
<p> Mr. Romney's campaign has promised that the tougher rhetoric will be part of Mr. Romney's debate performances. But he is not the only one who will be on the offensive.
<p> Representative Ron Paul of Texas unveiled an ad this week accusing Mr. Gingrich of "serial hypocrisy" for claiming to be a political outsider while having had a career in which he was deeply involved in governing and lobbying.
<p> Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, on Thursday attacked Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney, saying that Americans lack trust in their leadership and do not need "a lobbyist in chief" or a "panderer in chief."
<p> Look for those phrases to trip easily from Mr. Huntsman's tongue during the debate next Thursday. (Mr. Huntsman did not qualify to attend Saturday's debate because of low polling numbers.)
<p> Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, offered a peek at part of his strategy -- and a likely message he will try to put forward during the debates -- in an ad that attacks the idea of gays serving in the military, and accuses President Obama of waging a "war on religion" in the country.
<p> "There's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in the schools," Mr. Perry says in the ad, running in Iowa. "Faith made America strong. It can make her strong again."
<p> Mr. Gingrich has largely held back from harsh rhetoric about his rivals, preferring to maintain the above-it-all, professorial manner that has won him plaudits from viewers during the debates.
<p> But Mr. Gingrich is certain to find himself in a new and unfamiliar place during the debates: under fire by his rivals and under scrutiny by the moderators of the debate who will no longer ask him a question and quickly move on.
<p> Mr. Gingrich and his aides express no concern about the debates, professing supreme confidence in the former speaker's ability to thrust-and-parry with the best of them. So far, Mr. Gingrich's use of exasperation -- especially directed at the media -- has endeared him to audiences.
<p> But Mr. Gingrich can also get testy, as he did when Mr. Romney accused him during one debate of being the inspiration for the individual health care mandate.
<p> And Mr. Gingrich has for years demonstrated a lack of discipline that sometimes leads him to say something with conviction that quickly gets him into hot water. The other candidates on the stage are no doubt ready to pounce if Mr. Gingrich has one of those moments.
<p> The debates over the course of the next week are only one piece of what is finally becoming a multidimensional campaign. The candidates are descending on the early-voting states. The campaigns and their allies are taking to the television airwaves with millions of dollars. Direct-mail appeals are being sent out and volunteers are knocking on doors.
<p> But the past six months have proved that the debates can be crucial moments in the presidential calendar, dashing the hopes of some candidates even as they provide momentum for others.
<p> There is every reason to believe that the upcoming televised exchanges could be just as consequential.
