<h> From The Bottom Of My Heart Lyrics - Wallflowers
<p> Fire on the porch on a summer's night All of my things are there inside Black smoke rise up, burn on burn higher I smell leaves and burning tires Dogs in the meadows barking wild Blackbird rise up, tell me what you have done
<p> I'm not drunk and I'm not sad There's nothing inside that I want back Let me touch your lips, let me see where you're at Do you wonder how I am tonight Then don't lose time looking in my eyes Not every tear means you're gonna cry
<p> From the bottom of my heart Comes a cold dark feeling There is nothing but dust in the layers I'm peeling From the bottom of my heart Beats a rattling drum comming up from the depths Into the rays of the sun
<p> Now, under crushing skies of grays Paralyzed with phantom pains Before this room became just a place Where I just sleep through endless days Spinning webs and carving names Where thoughts break up, exploding in space
<p> But I once crossed a quarter mile Through black pools of razor wires And cut through steel with the edge of a file While singing rhapsodies in stride Hellbent and dignified But my time has come Who you fooling and why?
<p> From the bottom of my heart Comes a cold dark feeling There is eminent death to the promise I'm keeping
<p> From the bottom of my heart Comes an army of one Marching back up the steps Into the rays of the sun
