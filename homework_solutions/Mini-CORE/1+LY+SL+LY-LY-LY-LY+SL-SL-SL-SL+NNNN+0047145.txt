<p> I took a double take out on the interstate When I saw her makin' eyes at me So I followed her down - the clubhouse drive Past the pool on the 18th green In the parkin' lot...I said it's mighty hot Maybe I could buy you a beer She said I'm glad you asked...but I'll have to pass Cause only members are allowed in here...and I said
<p> Well I'm a member of a country club Country music is what I love I drive an old Ford pick-up truck I do my drink-in from a dixie cup Yea I'm a bona-fide dancin' fool I shoot a mighty mean game of pool At any honky-tonk roadside pub I'm a member of a country club
<p> You look so invitin'...thought it might be excitin' For a woman with a limousine To go bouncin around...in a beat up truck With a man...in wore out jeans It's five o'clock before Friday night Here's where the fun begins So don't worry 'bout your reputation Cause you can tell all your friends
