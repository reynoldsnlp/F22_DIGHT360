<h> 'I'm going to have a glass of wine and a whole burger!' Lily Aldridge tucks in as Angels party after Victoria's Secret show
<p> After months of dieting in preparation for their annual fashion show, some of the Victoria's Secret Angels had just one thing on their mind once it had wrapped - food.
<p> And one person in particular who was longing to get stuck into some fast food was Lily Aldridge.
<p> The model and wife of Kings of Leon's Caleb Followill looked super trim on the catwalk on Wednesday despite giving birth to her first child Dixie less than five months ago.
<p> Time to pig out: Lily Aldridge couldn't wait to get her hands on a burger and a glass of wine when she hit the Victoria's Secret Fashion show after party on Wednesday with husband Caleb Followill
<p> And ahead of walking in the show she wasn't concerned about anything, other than what she would be tucking into once it was over.
<p> Lily told Us Weekly : 'I'm going to meet my husband in the bar and have a glass of wine and a whole burger. It can't come fast enough!'
<p> The star, who sported a black and gold lacy Dolce and Gabbana dress, got her wish and then some as she shared a photo from the after show party of six sliders and a side of french fries on her Instagram.
<p> Celebration burgers!: Lily posted this photo to her Instagram along with the words 'Come to mama'
<p> Appetite on her mind: Ahead of the show Lily said the first thing she was going to do was change into her Dolce and Gabbana dress and eat a whole burger
<p> Sensational: Lily was in fantastic form during the show despite giving birth to her first child just five months ago
<p> She posted a photo of the carbs she was about to start chomping along with the words 'Come to mama'.
<p> She had also revealed she stuck to 'really clean foods' during her diet and claimed: 'I ate so much salmon for the last two months - you wouldn't believe it! Literally, I cannot see salmon for like eight months, I ate so much of it.'
<p> As Lily focused on her appetite, other Angels were more concerned with letting their hair down.
<p> Letting her hair down: Meanwhile Alessandra Ambrosio was more concerned with dancing the night away
<p> Model moment: There were glamorous girls everywhere you looked at the New York after party
<p> Alessandra Ambrosio was seen dancing the night away solo in her party dress, while some of the models hung out together.
<p> Miranda Kerr and Shanina Shaik posed up with new additions Jourdan Dunn and Cara Delevigne.
<p> Unsurprisingly, many of the stunning women wanted to show off the figures they worked so hard for after they took their final walk on the catwalk.
<p> Strike a pose: Even though she was no longer working, Joan Smalls couldn't help but pose as she hung out with a pal
<p> They deserve it: There was no doubt the Angels, including Erin Heatherton who is pictured with Harley Viera-Newton, earned their evening of fun together after all that hard work
<p> Pucker up: Karlie Kloss teased the camera with a little kiss as she left the party after a night of dancing
<p> Most of the Angels hitting the after-party in New York City on Wednesday opted therefore to ignore the snow and sport revealing outfits -- and leading the perfectly coiffed pack was Miranda, as well as and Candice Swanepoel.
<p> Miranda was taking a break from Victoria's Secret underwear for the evening and decided to go bra-less in her plunging black dress.
<p> The 29-year-old showed off her golden tan and ample cleavage in her short, clingy frock which she paired with matching caged shoe boots and a jewel-encrusted clutch bag.
<p> She's just heavenly: Miranda wore a plunging black dress which clung to her outstanding figure
<p> Celebrating their success: Behati Prinsloo and Candice shared a hug after strutting on the catwalk
<p> Walk on the wild side: Candice's very racy dress had a dangerous slit all the way up to her waist
<p> Candice, 24, on the other hand chose to parade her legs rather than her chest.
<p> She wore a long black number that oozed sex appeal thanks to a dangerous slit which crept all the way up to her waist.
<p> The South African born beauty was fresh-faced with her blonde locks swept out of her face in a neat ponytail, and she also slipped on a pair of black court shoes.
<p> Silver sirens: Alessandra and Karlie looked as though they had coordinated their sparkling silver party dresses
<p> Best of British: Jourdan and Cara had plenty to celebrate after making their Victoria's Secret debut
<p> The long and short of it: Behati wore an unusual dress with a message while Lily Donaldson was all leather and legs
<p> Other models followed suit of Miranda and Candice in revealing black dresses, with Lily Donaldson in a form-fitting frock with leather top and Joan Smalls flashing flesh -- and her underwear -- in a mesh ensemble.
<p> British exports Jourdan and Cara posed up together after their successful debut on the Victoria's Secret catwalk, also joining the little black dress brigade.
<p> While there were glamorous girls left, right and centre, there was also a famous male face in the crowd in the form of Lily's husband Caleb, who was on hand to support his heavenly wife.
<p> Doing just peachy: Erin moved on from her rumoured split with Leonardo DiCaprio as she partied with Harley
<p> Ringleaders: Jessica Hart (L) and Doutzen Kroes' eye-catching dresses appeared to be circus-inspired
<p> Snow what?: Elsa Hosk didn't bat an eyelid and the freezing weather as she posed upon her arrival

<p> If size 6-8 is slim to you then obviously you don't know what your talking about. Size 6-8 is nothing even close to slim especially at 5'5 and I'm not saying all this to be a a hole but to be totally honest with you. There's a reason why the modeling industry has a specific preference to size 0's and not 6-8 and why they get paid millions but clearly you don't get it. - Christopher Jl , vienna, United States, 10/11/2012 18:09 Evidentally, you're not aware of what you're reading are you? This is a UK publication and the sizes are quoted according to UK sizes. Here a 6-8 is a US 0-2. Check your facts before posting.

<p> A whole burger and a glass of wine is her treat?! Seriously, I dont understand the body of these models. Im a very slim size 6-8 and Im 5'5. Granted, im shorter and probably not as toned, but I eat whatever I like when I feel like and dont make an issue of it (with gym sessions too). These women are millionaires just by dieting and walking down a runway in underwear. There are thousands of other women who dont need to go to extremes and look just as good. SAD! Shut it shorty ! Who asked u ?
<p> Lily is a stone cold fox and I can't believe she only gave birth a matter of months ago. I am very jealous (well not jealous, that wouldn't be bnice, just slightly envious, lol) As for some of them though, they are way way too skinny to be considered sexy - some of them have totally skeletal arms.
