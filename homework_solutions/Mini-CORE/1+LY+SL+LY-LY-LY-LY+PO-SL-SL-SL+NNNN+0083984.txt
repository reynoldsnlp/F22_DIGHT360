<p> Capo 2 [D] [A] [G] On a warm summer night, down in Austin [D] [A] [G] I got down on one knee, and asked for your hand [D] [A] You said you're moving to fast, I'm not ready [G] [D] [A] [G] Let's take it slow, and I said alright baby, baby we'll take it slow [Em] [G] And then I drove you home, you invited me in [Em] [A] I came to bed with you, and we made love [D] [A] Like it was our first time, Like it was the last time [G] Like it was something brand spanking new, [A] Like something that we had never knew [D] [A] Like it was the first time, that I'd ever seen your face [G] DaddG [Em] Like it was the first night we made love and you wore lace [G] [A] I kissed you good night, and I pulled out of your drive [D] Like it was the last time On a cold rainy night, down in Austin I covered you up and I kissed you goodnight I got in the car, pulled out of the drive Drove down the street, I put her in park, at the stop sign And then I put her in reverse, I backed her into the drive I came to bed with you, and we made love Chorus [Em] [G] Some things never give, but if it's the last thing that I do [Cadd9] [A] I promise you, I promise you, I'm gonna leave you Chorus
