<p> Last week we took at look at Bogota, Colombia . This week we talk to Jorge Portillo about bike polo in Honolulu, Hawaii.
<p> Tell us a little bit about Honolulu. In 2009, Honolulu population is about 374, 658 according to google. The weather is not too hot and not too cold, just about right.
<p> When and how did polo start here? I believe it all started with a small group of students playing bike polo in one of University of Hawaii rooftop.
<p> How many people play in your city? About 6 regular people play in our city, it would be great to see new faces playing bike polo.
<p> How often do you play? We play Wednesdays and Sundays, though wish we could play more days, which would be easier if we had a home court  to play in.
<p> Tell us about your courts We play on a tennis court on multiple parks, trying to find a spot we can call home. We don't pay for any of them.
<p> What have you found works to get new people playing polo in your city. We haven't yet found what works to get new people playing polo in our city, if you guys have any ideas you can find us at www.hnlbikepolo.com
<p> Are there any other clubs nearby? How far away is the nearest city that plays? The nearest city that plays is LA (a 5  hour flight away).
<p> Do you play with other clubs in your country often? We don't play with other clubs in our country, we'll love to, if you guys float on by Hawaii. Now that be great!
<p> Has your city hosted any tournaments or are you hosting any soon? Yes, we have hosted a tournament here, we called it "Broken Coconuts Tournaments"
<p> Tell us a little known fact about your city If you aren't here in Hawaii, you don't know what your missing haha.
