<p> This song just makes me think about my boyfriend, well ex-boyfriend, we sort of broke up less than 24hrs ago, knowing he's leaving the country in less than 2weeks, it's just sad, coz he's all what I want right now!
<p> ive heard this song for the first time recently why didnt i hear it on radio or tv i was never a celion dion fan but the truth is this song is one of the best songs i have ever heard it was a hidden treasure for me to find it well done rednex its the usual though the rubbish music is well aired and the best stuff you find yourself
