<p> Oh! If you want a raise in pay, I'll tell you what to do Go and ask the boss for it and he will give it to you He will give it to you, my boys, he will give it to you A raise in pay, without delay, oh, he will give it to you
<p> Ohhh, put it on the ground, spread it all around Dig it with a hoe: it will make your flowers grow
<p> For the men who own the industries I'm shedding bitter tears They haven't made a single dime in over thirty years In over thirty years, my boys, in over thirty years Not one thin dime in all that time, in over thirty years
<p> The cost of living ain't so high, I told my wife Miranda This talk of living being hard is Rooshian propaganda It's Rooshian propaganda, boys, just Rooshian propaganda From Molotov to Simonov, just Rooshian propaganda
<p> It's fun to work on holidays, or when the day is done; Why should they pay us overtime for having so much fun? For having so much fun my boys, for having so much fun. Pay overtime would be a crime for having so much fun. Ohhh...
<p> The men who own the industries, they own no bonds and stocks They own no yachts and limousines, or gems the size of rocks. They own no big estates with pools, or silken B.V.D.'s, Because they pay the working man such fancy salaries. Ohhh....
