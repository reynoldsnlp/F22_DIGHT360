<h> Book Description
<p> Introducing Israel Armstrong, one of literature's most unlikely detectives in the first of a series of novels from the author of the critically acclaimed Ring Road.
<p> Israel is an intelligent, shy, passionate, sensitive sort of soul: he's Jewish; he's a vegetarian; he could maybe do with losing a little weight. And he's just arrived in Ireland to take up his first post as a librarian. But the library's been shut down and Israel ends up stranded on the North Antrim coast driving an old mobile library.
<p> There's nice scenery, but 15,000 fewer books than there should be. Who on earth steals that many books? How? When would they have time to read them all? And is there anywhere in this godforsaken place where he can get a proper cappuccino and a decent newspaper?

<h> Review
<p> REVIEWS FOR RING ROAD: 'A Tristram Shandy for our times... The tone is part elegy, part satire, part howl and very, very funny. I laughed more times than I can remember over a novel for years ... Ring Road is well-observed and endlessly inventive, with all the messiness of a real place. Sansom's deadpan voice throws up jokes on every page.' Observer
<p> 'Calls to mind two other outstanding novels: Tristram Shandy...and Joseph Heller's Catch-22... One of those rare books that, once picked up, proves very difficult to put down.' The Irish Independent
<p> 'There is something fearless in the gaze Sansom turns on banality, and this novel is, in the end, a surprisingly gripping feat of coming to terms with what ordinary life is like.' TLS
<h> About the Author
<p> Ian Sansom reviews regularly for the Guardian and the London Review of Books. His first book, The Truth About Babies, was published by Granta in 2002, and his second, Ring Road, by Fourth Estate in 2004.
<p> Detectives in the English tradition stand either in the shadow of Holmes or of Watson. Holmes: the man superbly capable of his job, perfectly temperamentally suited to it. Watson: a man like ourselves, as baffled as we are, yet somehow (on his own, or with Holmes) able to contribute to the solution.
<p> In Israel Armstrong, half Jewish, half Irish, fat, almost unemployable, a good natured blunderer who should never have left the safety of Oxford Brookes, and should never, ever have gone to Northern Ireland, Ian Sansom has created a character who perhaps trumps all of the Doctor Watsons in literature. Perpetually mystified, he makes virtually every other character seem the equivalent of Sherlock Holmes, as he wanders around looking for Ballygullable, and for a library-load of books that the astute reader will have located round about chapter three. But not everything is as it seems and, in true bumbling style, Armstrong solves by accident the one crime that nobody could solve, while he fails to solve the main mystery to which everyone else knows the answer.
<p> Israel Armstrong is not a hero defined by his strengths, but by his weaknesses. Indeed, Sansom gifts him with no discernible strengths whatsoever. He has no social skills, few powers of deduction (and those he has invariably lead him in the wrong direction), and the author meticulously avoids allowing him to use the knowledge gained from books to his advantage. Armstrong is just like us, the reader, but even more so. He is the ordinary man's un-extraordinary man. Sansom does give him one moment, but only one, where his knowledge about books (rather than anything he learned in books) gives him the edge, and on this the story turns in the most utterly believable way.
<p> I'm not sure whether this is a comedy or not. In principle it should be hilariously funny, but the author never allows us to get far enough away from his protagonist to let us have a good laugh at him (all the other characters get to laugh, though). As it is, we get closer to Israel Armstrong than to perhaps any detective I have encountered.
<p> A marvellous book, superbly written, and boding great things for the future.
<p> I thought this was going to be a detective story, when I found it wasn't. Was I disappointed? No, definitely not. I found it very refreshing. I warmed to the main character Israel, his naivity of the rural areas of Northern Ireland is totally believable. Never having been to Northern Ireland I have what I believe a very good overview of the rural area and the people who dwell there, as seen through Israel's eyes.
<p> This book is easy reading with Ian Sansom's wonderful wry sense of humour. Ok it may not be as good as Ring Road, but still a worthy read. I look forward to more in this series.
<p> The Case of the Missing Books (The Mobile Library) I know this has had mixed reviews and that's what makes the world go round. Personally, I loved it and would encourage people not to be put off by the negative reviews. Give it a chance. The humour must be too subtle for some people. This unlucky, unworldly character called Israel who hasn't figured out why his girlfriend was so insistent he go to Ireland or why she never answers her phone sums up this well -read reasonably intelligent man who has led a sheltered life. His adventures and misadventures are fairly believable and where they are not, it's entertainment. I think it depends on what level you read it. If you get the nuances- believe me they jump out at you, you will laugh your head off. Come on. Give it a try!
