<p> Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands? Close your eyes and trust it, just trust it Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air? Have you ever looked fear in the face And said I just don't care?
<p> It's only half past the point of no return The tip of the iceberg, the sun before the burn The thunder before lightning, the breath before the phrase Have you ever felt this way?
<p> Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone? Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry? Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside? [ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/p/pink-lyric\\...
<p> It's only half past the point of oblivion The hourglass on the table, the walk before the run The breath before the kiss and the fear before the flames Have you ever felt this way?
<p> robert.miller1948@yahoo.co.uk 08/10/12,11:48 I have just heard this song for the first time and was moved to tears - it was so beautiful and touched something inside that I hardly new was there. Pain, fear, hope, sadness all human emotion.
