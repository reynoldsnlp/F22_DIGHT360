<h> Long Time Lyrics
<p> It's been a long time, Since I've seen your smiling face. It's been a long time, Since I've seen a su-u-u-u-u-u-unny day.
<p> It's been a long time, Since you wore your pillbox hat. It's been a long time, Since we drove your Po-o-o-o-o-o-ontiac.
<p> It's been a long time, Since you gave me bu-u-u-u-u-u-u-utterflies It's been a long time, Since I've seen it bu-u-u-u-u-u-urning in your eyes.
<p> But I don't mind (I don't mind), No I don't (I don't mind), No I don't (I don't mind), When I've got you next to me. [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cake/long+t\\... ] It's been a long time, Since we tripped into this ditch. It's been a long time, Since we drank the ar-r-r-r-r-r-rsenic
<p> It's been a long time, Since we've been insi-i-i-i-i-i-ide of this tomb. It's been a long time, Since you wore your e-e-e-e-e-expensive French perfume.
