<p> Aha! We think we may have found further undeniable evidence that former US Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is, in fact, the world's biggest berk.
<p> Speaking at the Values Voter Summit in Washington on Saturday, the Republican bigwig told the assembled throng (many of whom were presumably under the impression they were actually quite bright): "We will never have the media on our side, even in this country. We will never have the elite, smart people on our side - because they believe they should have the power to tell you what to do."
<p> Yes, damn those smart people and their pesky informed opinions. If only everyone in America was a fully paid-up dimwit, Rick would be in the White House by now...
<p> And if you're in the mood for more messages from the bizarre world of US politics, we have just the thing right here...

<p> Why be so modest, Ricky S.? So the smart and elite people won't ever be on your side? You forgot you'll also never have the creative people, the humorous people, the kind people, the compassionate people, the female people, the non-white people, the academic people...
