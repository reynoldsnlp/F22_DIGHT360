<h> Commentary
<p> Here's the thing: I don't much care one way or another about the photo that appears on the cover of the upcoming issue of TIME. I mean, I have opinions about it -- I have opinions about everything -- but it doesn't rile me up in any way. Nor am I provoked by the subject matter of the article at hand. It's about attachment parenting, which is as worthy a topic for discussion as any. Sure, it's more substantively about whether attachment parenting sets too high a bar for moms, which is somewhat provocative, but I think that that's a worthy question. The title that appears on the cover -- 'Are You Mom Enough?' -- is probably the most provocative part of the package -- I mean, it pretty much shouts the question and demands an answer, and I think that that kind of challenge, the challenge to moms to ask themselves whether they measure up, is problematic at its core -- and I kind of really hated it. But even given that, I don't know that I would change it.
<p> I wouldn't change it, or the photo that accompanies it, or the articles that appear inside, because these are provoking discussion. It's a discussion that is uncomfortable at times, to be sure -- how we measure the success or failure of our motherhood is a particularly sensitive pain point within our community, for obvious reasons -- but the fact that it's an uncomfortable conversation doesn't mean that it's not worth having. Because regardless of we feel about questions concerning judgment and measurement and how we evaluate ourselves and each other -- whether we should, in fact, evaluate ourselves or each other at all -- they are questions that persist. They're there . Sometimes we talk about them, sometimes we don't; sometimes the conversations that we have about them are public, sometimes they're private. But whether or not they're out in the open -- on TIME magazine covers or on blogs or around kitchen tables or in hushed whispers over glasses of wine -- they're there. And they inform our motherhood, and our understanding of our motherhood, and the communities that we build around our motherhood. Ignoring them doesn't change that.
<p> So when I see people deploring the conversation -- the cries for us all to just stop talking about it already -- I recoil a little bit. Why should we stop talking about it? Because it fuels the so-called Mommy Wars? The tensions underlying those 'wars' are already there. Those are live wires. We should be paying attention to them. We don't make the judgments and vulnerabilities and pain points go away by pretending that they don't exist. Sure, there's an argument to be made that media discussion of these things foments conflict -- but whatever conflict emerges here does not emerge from nothing. It emerges from real tensions, real issues. And I'm enough of an old-school Habermasian to believe that we need a robust public discourse -- an engaged, lively community conversation -- about these issues if we're to work them through. Or perhaps not work them through -- and here I become less Habermasian and more Socratic -- but keep them alive and apparent and part of the ongoing discourse that makes us who we are.
<p> This is power of this space, as I've said here many times before : we have not just created a robust public platform for our storytelling and community building, we have transformed storytelling and community, and with our story-driven, discursive community are changing how we think and talk and engage and connect around motherhood and womanhood and family -- things that were so for long marginal to public discourse. We're not just changing the conversation, we are changing the very nature of public conversation such that it almost no longer makes sense to distinguish public conversation from private.
<p> We are the conversation. So why are we trying to shut ourselves down? Let's embrace this conversation -- even, or perhaps especially, the parts where people say that they don't like it or that it makes them uncomfortable or that they thing that the conversation itself hurts us -- and dig into it . Let's talk it out -- or at least talk it forward . These discursive provocations are a gift, an opportunity.
<p> When Emilia was about six months old, Kyle and I set about getting life insurance. At the time, I joked about it: look at us! We are so mature! And grown-up! ADULT, EVEN! GO US. I also related the story of how, as part of the process of applying for life insurance, a nurse visited [...]
<p> (The post below repurposes, with some revisions, a post that I wrote late last year after TEDWomen. I've been revisiting it this weekend as I prepare notes for a panel that I'm moderating tomorrow at the WIE Symposium, on mothers and social change. The discussion tomorrow will be, to some extent, a consideration of the [...]
<p> I breastfed both of my children. I breastfed Emilia on park benches and in restaurants and in libraries and on airplanes. I breastfed Jasper in front of a crowd at BlogHer '08 -- while I was speaking -- when he was eight weeks old. I breastfed Jasper by Guy Kawasaki's swimming pool, while sobbing and [...]
<p> I was never one of those little girls who played with dolls and dreamed of becoming a mommy. When I played with dolls, it was to concoct new adventures for Barbie, International Super Spy, or to host global summits on world peace with George, my stuffed monkey, the Bionic Woman, a clutch of plush kittens [...]
<p> There's a post at Babble this week by a mom who regrets having been too obsessed with photographing every moment of her family's life. She forced herself to put the camera down, and, she says, is happier for it. "While I still desperately want my boys to be able to look through photo albums of [...]
<p> Just over a year ago, I got an anonymous e-mail that said, among other things, this: You honestly make me sick. Keep making money off your dead dad, your dying nephew and your kids. Keep taking trips for free while your 15 minutes are still here, because eventually, people are going to see the scum [...]
<p> A couple of years ago, I wrote about spanking. I wrote a few posts, actually, and one magazine article, because I'd spanked my own child, and admitted it, and the ensuing uproar from outraged observers demanded its own commentary. And then the commentary kind of got out of hand -- the topic was, after all, [...]
<p> A couple of years ago, I received a very sweet e-mail from a self-professed 'dedicated lurker' who asked the following question: I wonder if you are ever concerned that your daughter's (beautiful) image will remain in cyberspace, with no mechanism for you -- or her -- to reclaim it or her privacy? She meant no [...]
<p> There's nothing like being away from home and getting a text from your spouse that says call me as soon as you can. It's about Emilia, he says when I call. What about Emilia? I don't know what the right words are to express, here, how shrill my voice was. 'Shrill' works decently well, I [...]
