<h> RBS boss: customers will have to pay for ring-fencing
<h> The Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted that "expensive" plans to ring-fence its retail operations from the more risky investment banking arm will see the bank pass on costs to business and household customers.

<p> Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of RBS, said the Government's plans to force all banks to separate their retail operations from "casino" investment banking activities would pile more costs on to the entire system which "somebody had to pay for".
<p> In last week's Queen's Speech, the Government confirmed it intends to introduce the Banking Reform Bill, drawing on the work of the Independent Commission on Banking.
<p> RBS, which began overhauling its investment banking arm in preparation for the regulatory changes earlier this year, has already admitted the move would cost thousands of bankers' jobs.
<p> Global banking and markets (GBM), the division housing RBS's risky investment banking activities, is merging with global transaction services (GTS), one of its safest and most profitable businesses. About 5,000 roles could be shed as a result, according to the bank.
<p> In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph , Sir Philip said ring-fencing could end up increasing the squeeze on consumers and cash-strapped businesses as banks worked out how to recoup costs.
<p> "What the banks want to make sure of is that it's not introduced in a way that is too expensive, because if it's expensive then either taxpayers will suffer in our case, or customers will suffer, because we'll have to eventually deal with our costs and reclaim some of our costs from customers," he said.
<p> Sir Philip said the bank would have to "get more efficient as well", raising the possibility of more job losses at the 82pc state-owned bank.
