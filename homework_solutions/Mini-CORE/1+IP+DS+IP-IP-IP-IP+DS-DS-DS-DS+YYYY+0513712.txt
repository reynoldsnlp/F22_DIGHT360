<h> More About the Author
<p> Louis Paul Priolo is the director of the Center for Biblical Counseling at Eastwood Presbyterian Church in Montgomery, Alabama. A graduate of Calvary Bible College and Liberty University, he is the author of several books, including The Heart of Anger, The Complete Husband, Teach Them Diligently and Pleasing People. Lou is a Fellow in the National Association of Nouthetic Counselors and instructor at the Birmingham Theological Seminary. He travels frequently throughout the United States and abroad teaching at Christian marriage, family and counseling conferences.
<p> This book answered so many questions for me. Having read "Shepherding a Child's Heart", I understood the concept of how to parent biblically by looking at heart issues instead of behavior and using scripture to do so, but I didn't know what scriptures to use or exactly how to implement this plan. "Teach Them Diligently" gives the detailed explanation, along with categorized scriptures of how to convict, rebuke, teach, and train your children with God's Word. A must-have for any parent who desires to bring up children to be spiritually equipped to handle life. It makes your life a whole lot easier. My 4 year-old son already has four such scriptures hidden in his heart only two weeks after my husband and I implemented these parenting principles. Thanks Lou!
<p> How refreshing to see a parenting book written by someone who clearly loves the Lord and wants to honor Him! This book has been a valuable resource to my family as we seek to raise not just good children, but godly children! So disappoiting to read negative reviews from people who, in my opinion, did not read the entire book. Proverbs 14:12 tells us "There is a way which seems right to a man, but it's end is the way of death." I am sure the author was aware that the chapter on spanking would be controversial. Thank you for fearing God more than man! "He who withholds his rod hates his son, But he who loves him disciplines him diligently." Proverbs 13:24 So nice to see Lou Priolo walking in the truth and teaching us to do the same..especially when it comes to our precious children.
<p> Priolo is AMAZING! he does what no other author I know has been able to do! .Take the Bible and make it real in a way that transcends the bounds of its paper medium. I started by reading the Heart of Anger and then bought The Complete Husband (Both excellent books). Teaching them Diligently is THE how to guide for biblical parenting. It is cover to cover practical step by step advice on how to use scripture to raise your children the way God meant for them to be raised. The topical appendix in the back is simply priceless. This book has helped me with scripture memorization because it has encouraged and empowered me to access and apply scripture like never before. If you are a Christian Parent - or simply a parent who cares about raising children with character and integrity - your next click should be add to cart!!! ENJOY!
