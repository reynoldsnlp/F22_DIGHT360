<h> Completely clean share classes: it should be black and white
<p> In the unbundled world, a totally clean share class is as transparent as it gets. It allows the investor to see exactly what they are paying for each element, which is clearly in the best interests of the client and end customer.
<p> In my opinion, any discussions around how a clean share class will supposedly restrict client fund choice, is an attempt to introduce some grey into what should be black or white when acting in the best interests of the end investor.
<p> In September last year, we made it known that we had approached fund groups about our desire to have a completely clean share class and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Contrary to what a number of platforms have been saying, fund managers understand not only the inevitability of a clean share class world, but also the need to comply fully and unequivocally with the spirit of RDR, accepting that it won't be cheap to do.
<p> Many see clean share classes as the future -- enabling them to support platforms and intermediaries in complying with demands for clear, transparent retail charging. The vast majority are even looking to launch a completely clean share class in the next few months.
<p> Right now, fund managers are reviewing pricing across all of their distribution channels and this is where the competitive benefit of unbundled charging will become most apparent for the end-investor. At the end of the day, that is all that really matters.
<p> 1)t Cofunds and some other platforms were not willing to do this before RDR were they? Because there was nothing they could skim off a clean share class and pocket. 2) TERs will only go up because of the fees that some platforms, such as Cofunds, will start to charge fund groups to list clean share classes. At the end of the day, clean share class or no clean share class, platforms will take their cut and the client will end up with a higher TER. Sometimes I think that it would be better for the client to cut out the middleman and go back to dealing directly with the fund houses. Oh I forgot, - the FSA don't really want me to do that do they because in their opinion, it's better for the client to pay a platform charge.
<p> The total expense ratio at a fund level is not impacted by the charges set by the platform - it does not follow that TERs will go up as a result of platform charges. Cofunds welcomes greater transparency of TERs as we believe the range of charges in the market place warrant further debate. We believe fund managers will need to justify these overall charges in the fund.
<p> As for the total cost to the customer, there are of course three discrete charges -- the adviser fee (will this go up or down?), the cost of the platform and the cost of the fund. All of these added together will form the total charge. Just what the FSA wanted the RDR to drive out.
<p> The growth of platforms in UK suggests that they are adding considerable value to the adviser and their business. We see no evidence that advisers would want to go back to the days when they dealt with fund managers directly.
<p> There already is a method of taking all the different layers of charges into account and declaring it as one number to the client - it's been with us for nearly 2 decades and is called RIY - reduction in yield. There is no hiding place from RIY as there is no charge that can't be turned into an RIY. Unbundling is also not new, now 12 years old and 'institutional' (nil commission) share classes have been around throughout that time and available on the more advanced platforms, so plenty of experience with clients to take into account - and it is sometimes hard to explain that the 'clean' share price - which performs better because of lower charges - has a higher unit price than the 'unclean' class which he sees quoted in the paper. Also, what is 'clean'? Is a 1.5% fund reduced to 1% clean? What about the unbundled platforms which would mostly have those funds at 0.75%? Why stop there, active management actually costs about 0.25% - the rest is account handling (increasingly taken over by platforms) and marketing. In a professional financial adviser world, why would marketing influence the fund choice? Plenty of room for fund charges to reduce a lot!
