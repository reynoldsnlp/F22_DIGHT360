<h> The Life That Could Have Been Lyrics
<h> A1
<p> I meet someone the other day It's good to see her face again She's the one who got a way Way back when Showed photos of her family Soon to marry mum to be She used to want all that with me And she smiled and I laughed Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight What would my world be like? Would I be standing at the altar by her side? Would her child be mine? And I think that I've just seen The life that could have been She's happy now and that's a fact And who am I to mess with that So I won't try to get her back In a way I'm glad 'Cause that was then and this is now Still I can't help but think about All the things that I'm without But I wave the white flag Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight What would my world be like? Would I be standing at the altar by her side? Would her child be mine? And I think that I've just seen The life that could have been And as she was walking away I thought I saw her Turn back and hesitate Look at me as if to say I imagined if you didn't take that fight What would my world be like? Would you be standing at the altar by my side? What would our child look like? Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight What would my world be like? Would I be standing at the altar by her side? Would her child be mine? And it's the strangest thing And I think that I've just seen The life that could have been The life that could have been
