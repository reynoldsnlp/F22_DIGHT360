<p> This week Paul Cotterill asked if Labour was finally developing a coherent line on Europe. I fear he is too optimistic too: in the EU debate nothing can be nuanced and easily understood.
<p> But what really perplexes me are the Tories who think there is an easy way out of this for their party.
<p> I sometimes read blog-posts by those on the Tory right agitating for an EU referendum, and I get the feeling they don't want to confront the obvious truth. I think the Tory debate will play out like this. David Cameron will offer a commitment to a referendum in the next Tory manifesto, and that's about it. He will tell (UKIP) voters at the election that he is absolutely committed to a referendum and electing a Conservative party will help ensure that.
<p> The Labour party will do something similar as part of a tacit non-aggression pact. Ed Miliband keeps saying it is not a priority but that doesn't mean he has written off the referendum. I'm quite confident it will be in the next manifesto.
<p> But the Labour internal debate won't be as fractious as the Tory one. This is primarily because Tories think Cameron will lead them out of the EU. He won't -- I'm certain he will argue for staying within the EU. Furthermore, I expect the business community will largely be for staying within the EU.
<p> The dividing line would be roughly as follows: the little-England Daily Mail Tories will go to war against the Telegraph-reading business community. It is inevitable that the business community will win, which is why Cameron will never agree to campaign for the UK to leave the EU.
<p> Daniel Hannan MEP talks of the first-mover-advantage in offering an EU referendum. I don't think he convinces anyone. Labour are already trying to neutralise this by having a referendum offer ready if the Tories use it as an election tool.
<p> The only problem for Labour, I suspect, is that a simple position is impossible. Of course, the party will campaign to stay within the EU and will be fairly confident of winning that referendum. But our alliance with the French will be strained -- we may agree with them on growth over austerity, but we won't agree with them on cutting the CAP budget for the EU. We want massive reform but our new European will resist that.
<p> I suspect that while the Tories will be riven by infighting over the EU referendum, Labour will struggle to outline a clear, coherent position to convince people they know what they're doing. But at least it will avoid a civil war.
<p> Miliband wants to stay in, we will see his smiling face drone on as he does telling us to stay in, or the smiling pair of ears of Blair telling us what will happen, and I think just because of those two I'd vote out.
<p> A referendum which labour says it can win would be a dangerous game, what happens if it says out, would we then have another and another until we are back in, more then likely.
<p> I cannot for the life of me see people listening to politician not now anyway and a lot may well vote no just to show these people we are the one with the power at referendums.
<p> When push comes to shove I think people will vote to stay in the EU. We may not like it much just like most don't like paying taxes but the consequences of staying out of the EU may not be what people want either.
<p> "Would a referendum offer (I hesitate to use the word promise) be enough to collapse the UKIP vote at the GE sufficiently to get Cammo back in?"
<p> In my opinion, no, although it may peg back the UKIP vote to an extent. But the Tories didn't win the last election, needing the Lib Dems to prop them up, and I can only see the Tory vote sliding. If UKIP do well in the Euro elections, which I expect they will, then the question is; what will this do to the Tories? The grassroots are closer to UKIP in thinking than with Cameron and his metrosexual chums, although they remain tribally-loyal, but what if a handful of Tory MPs finally jumped ship?
<p> Does it matter whether it is disasterous, terrible, brilliant, great, etc. for any political party, so long as the people of this country are given a say?
<p> Should we not be more concerned with political freedom and democracy than stupid vote spinning?
<p> I am amazed that a blog like LC who attests to the importance of democracy would rather this be about party politics, but then it has been said that socialism and democracy have but nothing in common except an 'equality' in restraint and servitude.
<p> Firstly, I don't think any European referendum would be divisive for the Tories any longer. Except for a few hangovers from the days when dinosaurs roamed the earth, the Tories are pretty settled on an anti EU view. The only division is between the "leave now" and "negotiate for a looser union" factionss, and I don't think the former would kick up a fuss about an attempt at negotiations, and I don't think the latter would settle for minor, cosmetic changes.
<p> Secondly the form of any referendum might be critical. There are a number of options:
<p> Pre-negotiation between stay in on current terms, or negotiate and threaten to leave if they are unucessful. This has the advantage of concentrating the minds of the rest of the EU, but might lead to calls for a second referendum.
<p> Several post-negotiation options:
<p> Unsucessful negotiations. The Government says the terms are unsatisfactory and offers an in/out choice.
<p> Sucessful negotions. The Government says the terms are satisfactory and offers an in/out choice.
<p> Sucessful negotions. The Government offers an accept or status quo choice choice. In this case they could recommend either choice or, indeed, neither. This is the only case where the Tory party might kick up a fuss. Theey will insist on an option to leave, perhaps as a third choice.
<p> Mark, you make some good points but the position seems to be either we will be forced to have a refferendum based on a Treaty change related to closer union for the Eurozone, the rest of Europe will want a yes vote or will simply ignore us and do what is needed outside the treaty.
<p> In terms of a UK initiated referendum, the Tories are split, you are right the Ken Clarke pro Euro faction is all but dead, but the rest of the party is split between those demanding a refferendum with an expectation of getting out, and a group who have not thought through the consequences of having a refferendum while they actually want to stay in.
<p> "When push comes to shove I think people will vote to stay in the EU. We may not like it much just like most don't like paying taxes but the consequences of staying out of the EU may not be what people want either."
<p> if that does happen, under that rationale, god help my faith in democracy and in the british people to exercise democracy, because after that, it wont exist in any existing form and the people voted to abolish democracy.
