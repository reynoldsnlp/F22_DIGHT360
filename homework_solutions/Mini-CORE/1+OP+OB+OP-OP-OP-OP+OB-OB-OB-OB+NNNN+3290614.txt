<h> The Great Dream of Immersion
<p> Language acquisition is easier when you are immersed in the language, this is true. But the exact benefits depend on the stage of learning that you are at. As someone who has already been learning for three years, this is a huge boost for me. But for someone with little proficiency, the relative benefits are much lower.
<p> Regardless of where we are, when we are learning a language we need to have some guide to the overall structure, in particular grammar of the language. Reading an introductory textbook in Australia, and reading the text book in Nanjing are roughly the same experience. The main difference is that there is a higher sense of urgency and the motivation. Having access to even a few speakers of the language you are learning in your home country is enough to emulate the use of the language, and the advantage will be that they will be able to explain what is happening in the language, rather than just looking at you as though you are from a different planet.
<p> The other great issue I take with the great dream of immersion is that it is not feasible for most people most of the time. It is held out as the 'only' way to progress, and this often gives learners false expectations about how much they can improve in their home country, and the speed at which they will learn when they are immersed. Moreover, for those who are only able to learn a language when immersed, they are deprived of the development of strategies to intergrate their target language into their lifestyle at home. Once you leave the country of immersion, you will need to draw on a range of skills and strategies to ensure that you can continue to use and interact with the language and culture.
<p> For those who see immersion as the only answer, there is a sense of fatalism that accompanies the flight home, and the deflation of leaving the great dream is usually enough to end the pursuit of language learning.

<h> About the Author
<p> After graduating from Honours in Linguistics at the University of Melbourne I worked as a research assistant at the Asia Institute looking at international and local student interactions. I also did an intership at Tohoku University, Japan looking at possible changes in the English curriculum to improve oral proficiency of high school students. I'm currently undertaking a year of language study before doing a Masters of Education at Nanjing University.
<p> I founded Language Connection, a not-for-profit which operates in Australia, Japan and China, and reaches roughly 2,000 language learners annually. I had my first book published in 2009 (Nothing's Impossible: The Alan Rea Story). I have been the five time Australian Footbag Champion and the Education Director for the International Footbag Players Association.
<p> In the future I want to help develop language policy, curriculum, textbooks and teacher training so that more Australians can have the wonderful experience of language learning that I have had.
