<h> Rainbow Butt Monkeys As Far As I Can Spit lyrics
<p> How can I trust in anyone When I can't trust myself? I'm stealing from better lives The lives up on the shelve But I'm not As lonely As I thought But I know now That it takes much longer To be free from them What used to come so naturally Seems to go away You're killing me from inside out To make me understand And I can't Beleive this And I pray that you'll find out That I did understand That you were... That you were FINE!! FINE!! FINE!! FIGHT FINE!! FINE!! FINE!! FINE!! FIGHT FINE!! LET ME GO!! I'm seeing things from darker lives We've seem to make a deed You're never thinking for yourself You're passing by your stray And I can't Beleive this And I pray that you'll find out That I did understand That you were... That you were FINE!! FINE!! FINE!! FIGHT FINE!! FINE!! FINE!! FINE!! FIGHT FINE!! [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rainb\\... ]
