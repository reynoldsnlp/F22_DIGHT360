<h> Keeping An Eye On The Other Ball.
<p> Much noise was made in political and legal circles about the statistics on Domestic abuse, Secterian singing/chanting and the like due to the so called Old Firm supporters before, during and after matches. We all felt that brush stroke I'm sure.
<p> With Sevconia banished to the lower reaches of Scottish football those statistics will be interesting come seasons end, should they be compiled.?
<p> The court details for example, how many arrests at SPL matches, which club those arrests where made at and the charges involved.
<p> If ever released those statistics may indeed give a clear view of just who is more likely to have been a major contributor to those stats and shouldn't everyone have a right to know.?
<p> In my own humble opinion, having always viewed none so bad as the Sevconia supporter with regards offensive behaviour, before, at or after matches but then I could be seen as biased. Never the less, I would expect to see a marked reduction in those statistics.
<p> Will we ever know.?
<p> Perhaps the keepers of such stats may not be too keen to release those figures or show any type of pattern. If so why.?
<p> After such a noisy campaign from those that steward these games all the way to the political spectrum driven indeed by many in the MSM, such a silence in itself could be seen as totally incompatable with previous actions. Is there a difference and what is it.?
<p> A then and now view could be helpful to this new true vision of the way forward for the benefit of football and all it's previous ails.
<p> Is the Offensive behaviour bill working so wonderfully well or has the disappearance of the so called 'Old Firm' game removed a much spoken of, likely sourced, bone of contention .?
<p> I am aware that there may be a revisit to that game due to the possible cup clash, again that may well be an interesting stat to take note of.
<p> Do old habits die hard.?
<p> I wonder if our beloved media, so often the complainers, would indeed research or have any inclination to furnish supporters, especially those that may have been so easily tarred with the sweeping assertion brush, with actual guidance as to the differences if any, due to the loss of the so called 'Old Firm' game and the loss of that Old Club involvement.
<p> Is there a will to do so for all clubs and their interests.?
<p> Domestic abuse ?.
<p> Domestic abuse rises ? So loudly by many in an authority position, blamed on that very match.
<p> Shall we see a reduction in the numbers that according to some in recent years was approaching epidemic status. Really.?
<p> Even this early in the footballing season, I personally feel less of an issue with such reports or the general feeling media or otherwise regards the usual nasty atmosphere both on and off-field at any SPL match so far, Secterian or Domestic so far seem calm. Is it.?
<p> That may change, but seasons end should tell much, if anyone would wish to calculate, where a statistic to be offered, as easily as when the noises have been greatest.
<p> If no mention, would that mean a reduction, and if so, is it so great a reduction that only the so called 'Old Firm' game was the true enemy to all.?
<p> How many heads will be deliberately covered in sand.?
<p> How many would report it as a major difference.?
<p> How many would lay blame where it was proper.?
<p> Am I just imagining it or has the death of RFC and birth of Sevconia a direct bearing on the usual noises on offensive issues blamed on the so called Shame Game. Are some truly seeing as different yet still same to suit.? Is it a case of with one breeds the other.?
<p> If Celtic are still the same club, still playing in the SPL with the same support yet those were seen as bad as each other in reference to Old Club Sevconia, yet statistics now are lessened, what does that mean.?
<p> I am aware that in D3 there have been some charged with offenses already, the question is, was that a norm expected before the introduction to D3 of the Sevconian supporter or is it seen as a new occurance.
<p> Only statistics can shine a light but will they be offered or ignored, will those stats rise or fall, will they then be seen outh-with the term 'Old Firm'.?
<p> Who to blame then or seek as like with like. ?
<p> It would also be interesting too, if ever the information became available, to see whether a rise in arrests or banning orders within the grounds of the 3rd division due to Alleged Secterian singing or other actions which have never truly been focused on that lower league before, to my knowledge.
<p> Perhaps they have but media/others, were simply lax in reporting such as un-newsworthy, being un-Sevco, Un-Celtic related.? Not tasty enough.!
<p> It strikes me as curious that this season has begun with very little, almost no comment on the very issue that seemed to be a scourge in every season most notably recent years, for all seemed guilty of such in equal measure within the SPL when Sevconia where plying their trade in that league. Is that silence an acknowledgement.?
<p> So are all guilty more or Less at present without them.? Then why the quiet.?
<p> Is there a marker so early for differences since the changes in leagues, there should be.!
<p> I do hope someone, somewhere for the greater good is embarking on a statistical finding, looking at the increase or decrease in such matters. For me it would say a lot about from where those much chastised characteristics reside most, rather than simply say all have some and let's move on as unchangeable.
<p> I would say as important a relay of such information as it would be to relay over many years the damning indictment of it, to people that may have disputed and been at odds regards their own club/clubs.
<p> The bigger culprit should indeed be exposed for surely not all are equally to blame.
<p> ( Instigation, Retaliation) A part of any debate surely.
<p> People complain about the loss of the so called 'Old Firm' game, the excitement, the crowds, the sheer bedlam of it, players, managers, media, the fans, all talk of what will be missed.
<p> For me many good things may come from the loss of the so called 'Old Firm' game but will we ever know, such is the clamour it seems to revisit it, warts and all.
<p> If offences are down statistically, if football itself heads for a more family friendly future, then the cause and effects of the erosions of that hope, should be noted and stated and acted upon and not simply for paper sales, election or financial incentive.
<p> Change must be real change not just for the convenient moment.
<p> Personally, I could live without the so called 'Old Firm' game and the baggage and taint that seems to stick to all regardless of who is the creator of such taint.
<p> Yes, indeed, this season and next and perhaps even the next, may well give a clear indictation just where it has all been so wrong and whether it can be or indeed should be repaired.
<p> Many hope so, me, well, I love my club no matter who they play, as long as it's fair, honest and equal. ( I doubt they ever will be)

<p> The Insinuation that I may be of the Succulent Lamb variety leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. I'm more a Ham and Cheese guy way a wee bit of pickle, like an explosion in yer mouth. You really should leave well alone Shaun (Marty), all this cloak n dagger stuff, name changes and excursions into territory you yerself decided to leave and since have battled against, just makes the whole debacle even more unsavoury. Give it up man, yer no doin yerself any favours and I'm sure none here would bother with you should you just let it go. This is the Celtic family man, Celtic stand for understanding , acceptance and bonding, to all. They stand together though when faced with adversity, some things cannot be undone Shaun. Made your apology or make it and leave well alone would be my advice, this bullshit carry on really is stupid. Had no issues with you and would have none seems you wish to continue stirring an already bubbling pot, take it off the gas man, relax and best wishes n whatever you do. I mean that. Just let it go at that mate.
