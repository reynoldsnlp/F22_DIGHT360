<p> Birmingham police on Thursday, Nov. 1, 2012, arrested a costumed woman on a DUI charge after responding to a report that she was shot. A passerby called 911 after seeing the woman unresponsive at a traffic light and thinking she had been shot. Carol Robinson | crobinson@al.com
<p> BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - Police responding to a report of a woman shot in her SUV this morning found her bloody and slumped over the wheel of her vehicle at a Birmingham intersection.
<p> The woman wasn't shot, however. Instead, police said, she was just drunk, and still dressed in her Halloween costume, which appeared to be that of a bloody-pregnant-zombie. Or something.
<p> South Precinct officers were dispatched about 8:15 a.m. to the intersection of 41st Street and Messer Airport Highway. A passerby called 911 after seeing the woman covered in blood and unresponsive in her vehicle at a traffic light.
<p> "You can see why someone thought she had been shot,'' said one officer on the scene. The woman was covered in fake blood and white face paint. Her "pregnancy" police said, was part of the costume.
<p> Officers roused the woman, and then removed her from her SUV. She was handcuffed, searched and taken to the city jail on a DUI charge.
<p> The reveler seemed to take it all in stride. "It's all good,'' she said.
