<h> The Girl Who Used to Be Me Lyrics
<h> Patti Austin
<p> A bird is born to fly, born for the moment, it takes to the sky And all its dreams are riding on its wings But if it falls, the dreams aren't broken As long as the wind is fair, the sky is always there Oh, the girl who used to be me, she could fly, she was free You could read by the light of her smile Yes, the girl who used to be me used to go dancing She's been gone such a long, long while She left without a sound, nobody noticed she wasn't around And only the moon remembers her at all The days go by, you start asking questions And wondering why, why did the dreams all go? I guess it's time to know Oh, the girl who used to be me, she could fly, she was free And she wrote all the words to her song Yes, this girl who used to be me, used to go dancing And I feel she's been gone too long I'd like the chance to be the girl who used to be me, oh The girl
