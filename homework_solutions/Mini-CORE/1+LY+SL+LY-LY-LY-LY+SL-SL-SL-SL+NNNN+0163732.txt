<p> I'd like to live out all my dreams And if I could, yes if I could The nicest one would be with you And you'd be here with me Don't you ever get lonely
<p> Lord I'm no good when you're away But what do you expect From a girl Who loves you like I love you Won't you ever just get tired And come on home to me Don't you ever get lonely
<p> Chorus You're a part of me That I can't do without You're a part of me That dreams are all about But you can't hold on to Something that you never had before Love waits for the wind To bring you back again And take you away
<p> Friends say it's great now you're a star But what do they expect From a girl Who loves you just the way you were And late at night, I wish things had never changed And you were here with me Don't you ever get lonely
