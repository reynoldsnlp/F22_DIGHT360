<h> Lighthouse
<p> This kind of love Is more than a lifeline For a man as weak as me Who has no self belief
<p> This kind of love Is more than amazing For a man who lost his way Who thought it was too late
<p> How did the sea How did the sea How did the sea get so rough I would've drowned I would've drowned If you hadn't given me your love
<p> You're the light in the dark You're the seat in the park You're the lighthouse You're the lighthouse That I need You're the key to the door You're the Port in the storm And I need to find a shore When I can't swim anymore You always guide me back to solid ground You're my lighthouse
<p> This kind of love Is more than a feeling For a man who rarely tried I get all choked up each time You say you love me You could've walked away Could've give my problems back Could've left You took the chance
<p> How did the waves How did the waves How did the waves get so high I would've died I would've died If you hadn't loved me just in time
<p> You're the light in the dark You're the seat in the park You're the lighthouse You're the lighthouse That I need You're the key to the door You're the Port in the Storm When I need to find a shore Cos I can't swim anymore You always guide me back to solid ground You're my lighthouse
<p> Yeah, I owe it all to you everything I have right now I owe it all to you everything I didn't have you found Every time take me back to you
<p> You're the light in the dark You're the seat in the park You're the lighthouse You're the lighthouse I need You're the key to the door You're the Port in the Storm And I need to find the shore Cos I can't swim anymore You always guide me back to solid ground You're my lighthouse
