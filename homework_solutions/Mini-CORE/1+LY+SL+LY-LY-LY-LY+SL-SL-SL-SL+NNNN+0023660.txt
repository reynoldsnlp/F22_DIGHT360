<h> It's All The Way Live Lyrics - Coolio
<p> Chorus: It's all the way live. It's all the way live. It's all the way live. It's all the way live.
<p> Why you take a chunk and go up for a dunk? An' I never been a punk but your girl calls me hunk Straight to the hoop an' I know how to shoot If you wanna know the truth then you better get the scoop Commin' up to miss wit' my mic in my fist An' everybod's lookin' so you know I gotta bit You take me, that can't be Shook an' took like all rookies So if you're a beginner an' you want wanna be a winner Then you better have some spinach with your dinner So just put your head to the sky, if you wanna ride and keep you eye on the flies 'cause it's live
<p> Chorus
<p> What you see is what you get And what you got is a whole lotta sweat Blood and tears, so have no fear 'Cause they ain't seen moves like these in years I can shake it bake it, show the fake But never perpetrate or player hate, My name ain't Brat but I'm funkdafied My name ain't Lou but I can walk the sky So put it over here homie low An' go for broke And watch the smoke but don't choke Put your head to the sky, if you wanna ride and keep you eye on the flies 'cause it's live
<p> Chorus
<p> Ooo the music's in the grove, It's the rap that makes you move 'Cause LakeSide show-ed^ up at the party
<p> Ooo the music's in the groove, It's the rap that makes you move Coolio show-ed^ up at the party
<p> Chorus
<p> This ain't Penny Hardaway or Kareem Abdul It's Coolio in the house but you can call me cool An' I gotta keep it real for my peeps on the street you can fill it in your feet or bump it in your Jeep From sea to shinning sea the rows of century Bend under Sicily I put it down for the G Feel the fire, feel the funk An' you better clear the lane when I'm goin' dunk I ain't looking for protocol, got sumpin' for all o' y'all To make you get your back up off the ball Just put your head to the sky, if you wanna ride and keep you eye on the flies 'cause it's live
<p> Chorus
