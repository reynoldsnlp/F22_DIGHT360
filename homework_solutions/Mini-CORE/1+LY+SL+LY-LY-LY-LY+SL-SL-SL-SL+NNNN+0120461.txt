<h> Am I Ever Going To Find Out Lyrics
<p> Silence is golden But I think it's gonna kill me now Everything I've seen Never seems to fail me now No one told me that the world could fall through, yeah
<p> In between this am I gonna find a way To defeat this living inside yesterday Well, I'm alive, I think it's time to live Like I am
<p> Well, am I ever gonna find it Well, am I ever gonna find it Well, am I ever gonna find out [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/lifehouse/a\\... ] Patience can wait for now And I think I've waited for too long You always gave a choice Well, I know right to be wrong All my life has been slipping through your hands, yeah
<p> Well, in between this am I gonna find a way To defeat this living inside yesterday Well, I'm alive I think it's time to live Like I am
<p> Am I ever gonna find it Well, am I ever gonna find it Well, am I ever gonna find out
<p> Well, in between this am I gonna find a way To defeat this living inside yesterday Well, I'm alive I think it's time to live Like I am
<p> Am I ever gonna find it Well, am I ever gonna find it Well, am I ever gonna find out
