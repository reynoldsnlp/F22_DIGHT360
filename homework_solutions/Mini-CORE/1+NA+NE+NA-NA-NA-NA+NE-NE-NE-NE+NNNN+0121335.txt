<p> But the Ombudsman acknowledges he's not always automatically involved from the outset and that public confidence in internal police investigations would be improved if he was.
<p> Barbara Miller reports.
<p> BARBARA MILLER: Two Aboriginal teenagers are still in hospital after being shot by police 11 days ago.
<p> The 14- and 17-year-old were in a stolen car, which had mounted a footpath, hitting two women. A police officer was caught on video punching the 17-year-old in the head several times shortly afterwards.

<p> BARBARA MILLER: New South Wales Ombudsman, Bruce Barbour.
<p> BRUCE BARBOUR: It was fairly clear from the information that was available early on, that there was potential for there to be a view that there had been some misconduct. And during the course of the investigation into that critical incident those issues will be looked at, and we will be monitoring those issues very closely.
<p> BARBARA MILLER: Bruce Barbour's office is also over-seeing a police investigation into the death of a young Brazilian student after he was tasered by a police officer in March this year.
<p> But under the current system the Ombudsman is not automatically involved in such investigations:
<p> BRUCE BARBOUR: Recently I have recommended to the Police Minister and also the commissioner of police that in circumstances where there is a critical incident that leads to a death or serious injury, there ought be a mandatory requirement that such matters be the subject of independent oversight and scrutiny by my office.
<p> BARBARA MILLER: So that's not happening now automatically?
<p> BRUCE BARBOUR: Well some matters will come to us and others will not. What is required under the present system is that there needs to be an assessment made by police that there may be police misconduct in place.
<p> What we want to do is we want to remove that potential hurdle to make sure that all critical incident matters are able to be the subject of independent oversight by my office.
<p> BARBARA MILLER: Bruce Barbour says he came to the view that the Ombudsman and Police Integrity Commission should have automatic oversight following the Adam Salter case.
<p> Adam Salter, who was mentally ill, was shot dead by a police officer in his home in 2009.
<p> BRUCE BARBOUR: That was a matter that was not referred to this office. And as a result there was no independent oversight of that matter.
<p> BARBARA MILLER: The coronial inquiry found the police investigation into Adam Salter's death was seriously flawed, and the matter is now being looked at by the Police Integrity Commission.
<p> The Ombudsman has rejected calls by the New South Wales Greens for a fully independent body to carry out such investigations.
<p> BRUCE BARBOUR: The sort of system that Mr Shoebridge is calling for would be extremely problematic to introduce. Not only would it potentially prejudice criminal proceedings and coronial proceedings, given that you would have non-police investigating these matters, but there is a significant risk for duplication and enormous cost involved.
<p> BARBARA MILLER: Does it concern you, then, that there is a perception amongst some people in the community that these investigations are in no way independent?
<p> BRUCE BARBOUR: I am concerned that there may be people in the community that have that view. Certainly, it is very easy to say that the idea that police investigate police is not a desirable investigation. However, police only investigate police with very close scrutiny and monitoring by my office and also by the Police Integrity Commission.
<p> We have worked very, very hard to ensure the integrity of these investigation processes and the system works very well.
<p> BARBARA MILLER: The Ombudsman won't say how directly he's been involved in the investigation so far into the Kings Cross shooting.
<p> But says he has the power to be present at interviews, advise police on avenues of investigation, and demand access to all relevant material.
