<h> I Want To Know Your Plans Lyrics
<h> Say Anything
<p> I want to know your plans and how involved in them I am When you leave for good this fall, will I be forgiven? And if you want roses, I'll buy a bouquet If that just won't cut it, what can I say? You're what keeps me believing this world's not long dead Strength in my bones and the words in my head They pour out to paper, it's all for you 'Cause that's what you do, that's what you do I want to know your fears and if you'll forget me next year And when the jets go up and out, will our hearts stay here? If you could forgive me for being so brash (Forgive me) You could hit me or whip me, I'd savor each lash You're what keeps me believing this world's not long dead Strength in my bones and the words in my head They pour out to paper, it's all for you 'Cause that's what you do No more fighting It is only a waste of our time 'Cause soon we'll be leaving Will this strength still be mine? I'll look out for you till I die Till I'm gone, yeah I'll remember you till I die (Till I die) Till I'm gone You're what keeps me believing this world's not long dead Strength in my bones and the words in my head They pour out to paper, it's all for you You're what keeps me believing this world's not long dead Strength in my bones and the words in my head They pour out to paper, it's all for you 'Cause that's what you do, that's what you do
