<h> Forget Lords reforms or the NHS; it is the economy which threatens the Coalition
<p> No doubt it reflects on my education that when you say the word "differentiation", I instantly start thinking of calculus -- and of graphs (this is what an economics degree does to you). The Lib Dems it seems have the same sort of mindset: their differentiation strategy, devised by Richard Reeves, one of Nick Clegg's advisers, is illustrated by a graph. As time passes on the horizontal axis, "Lib Dem identity" increases and "Government unity and strength" consequently decreases. Start solving the simultaneous equations to find the intersection and you find that it's in 2012. Now is the point when the Lib Dems reckon their distinctiveness should start outweighing their commitment to Coalition.
<p> So it is hardly shocking to find that the newspapers are full of accounts of Lib Dem intransigence. Last week, it was tax cuts, as David Laws was enlisted to go on Newsnight and make the case for an increase in the personal allowance. This week, it is the NHS. As you can tell from the report on page two of today's Sun (headline: "Cam caves in to Clegg on health") the Liberal Democrats are getting uppity, demanding more compromises to Andrew Lansley's zombie Bill. No one is pretending that has anything to do with the contents of the reforms. No one understands the reforms. It's all about positioning: Nick Clegg wants to appear to be mauling the Tories, and ideally, the Tories want to appear not to be mauled too much. Call me cynical, but I suspect it was all coordinated in advance anyway.
<p> But that hasn't stopped the cries that the Coalition is disintegrating. In last week's Spectator , James Forsyth reported this:
<p> ...trust is now breaking down and there is a growing feeling that the coalition cannot go the distance until 2015. One Downing Street adviser told me this week, with a fatalistic air, that a '2014 election wouldn't be too bad really. David would have done his best, Nick would have done his best. But they just couldn't make it work any more.'
<p> Perhaps there is something to it. But the reason why is nothing to do with the NHS, or with Lords reforms -- Clegg's other fight. It's the economy. As growth undershoots, the difference between the fundamental principles of most Lib Dems and of the Conservatives are being exposed.
<p> The problem is that Lib Dems are Keynesians; they believe in the balanced budget multiplier. If the economy is spluttering, and we're short on cash, then they would say that the best way to boost the economy is to tax the rich (who are unlikely to spend all of their money) to give more to the poor (who are very likely to spend it). Most Conservatives however are supply-siders; they believe in changing the tax system to reward "wealth producers", and so advocate cuts to the 50p rate or to corporation tax. Though Tim Montgomerie has tried to find a middle ground, by advocating wealth taxes and spending cuts, these are essentially totally contrary positions. Either taxing the rich destroys wealth, or it generates it.
<p> If the state of the economy starts improving, and the Government begins to hit its deficit reduction targets, then this issue will go away. Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg and Vince Cable are all fiercely committed to the spending cuts already planned -- and indeed theoretically to new ones, after the next election. If, however, the situation in the eurozone continues to deteriorate, or if a war in the Middle East sets off a dangerous oil price spiral, then growth will fall and the deficit will widen further. Both sides will begin demanding very different Plan Bs, demanding either more spending or deeper cuts. There will be resignations, rebellions and backstabbing speeches -- from Tories as well as Lib Dems. The tension will only be resolved by an election.
<p> But that hasn't happened yet. In the meantime, let's not confuse differentiation for real difference. For the moment, the Coalition is safe.
