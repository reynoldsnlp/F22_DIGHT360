<p> JOHN: Neither of us ever thought, back on the first day that we met We were both so convinced that the dream would never end Nobody saw the signs man, it's funny how love is blind man 'Cause it can be over just as fast as it begins
<p> So now I be sitting here, I'm alone trying to stuff my fear Checkin' out one of the pictures there up on the shelf The story behind my song, is that you never know what you got 'til it's gone
<p> GIRL: What have I gotta do to make you love me? What have I gotta do to be heard? What do I do when it's all over? Sorry seems to be the hardest word
<p> JOHN: How can I forget that day, that I got up and walked away? I can still see the tears and the years fall from your eyes And now I'm all alone, I got nothin' else to do but pray For the dream that I might have you back here in my life
<p> I'm hoping that now you can see, between the real and the fantasy Reality is rough but it always has a key (GIRL: So sorry, so so sorry) The story behind my words... well, I hope you agree that the truth will set you free

<p> GIRL: (So sorry, so so sorry)

<p> GIRL: What have I gotta do to make you love me? JOHN: Tell me what I gotta do GIRL: What have I gotta do to be heard? JOHN: Oh, I need you in my life GIRL: What do I do when it's all over? JOHN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry GIRL: What have I gotta do? What have I gotta do? Sorry seems to be the hardest word
<p> JOHN: Tell me what I gotta do... Oh, I need you in my life (GIRL: So sorry, so so sorry)
