<p> bloodless was the fight he'd talk of an immortality that's warped him into an ideogram monument to the big i am whose ideas break the mould in the biopic all will be told a young tony curtis playing him yeah, meet the workshy wunderkind
<p> they'll flock to watch the auteur dither holding his infected liver and blank paper, waiting to be blessed his dictaphone begs to be impressed the critics love a long held tease the nations she folk on their knees smell fertility in the wind there goes the workshy wunderkind
<p> and everybody, as they stood there and grinned, meant less than the dust to the workshy wunderkind
<p> never for real, always bluffing in the garret of suffering the world class sculptor of bullshit for whom adventure is counterfeit and holey shoes are the holy grail art took his hair and made him pale he's thin on effort but thick skinned the self made workshy wunderkind
<p> his creative juices remain undisciplined but future glory has been pre-destined and your misunderstanding his reason underpinned how come you have never heard of the workshy wunderkind?
<p> with a degree in some vagueology, the fresh air industry was calling and with an inability to blush and an enthusiasm for crawling, twig boy chose the media, he loved it's lack of grace and overcropping he would become a cliche, and pay his way by teaching japs 'English For Shopping' via local news and advertising, he courted arseholes and drank with cretins met a celebrity chef, fucked a page 3 girl, and went to bars that only dicks could get in and all the while, the etiquette of critical blindness he was digesting (like the catholic church is anti-abortion because their priests need children for molesting) next, he got a job on Eurosport covering dominoes, falconry and kendo then went mainstream and won awards, for dirty-old-man-isms and innuendo went to premieres with Dani Behr and fathered Graham Nortons baby watched the sewage at Stamford Bridge, ghost wrote the best seller "Learn To Say Maybe" and the stinkier his flatulence the column inches'd just grow louder breeding a self righteous flambouyance fuelled by columbian marching powder but he was all heart and the turd he gave to Comic Relief is now part of showbiz folklore and the day he died, the public cried, but as he would have said, "less is the new more"
<p> thin man, ready and waiting to spill the beans down his shirt scumbag, all jealous and hating you can bet your secrets his minds on the dirt foul smell, well look kid whos talking he cannot live for asking to die his hell is the street that he's walking it's truely gruesome, his shitty little mind and his ears burn as he listens to shit stir mouth ablaze, bits of sex in her teeth his mind aglow, his face ugly and twisted there's naught up front, even less underneath bring me the head, the head of the stirrer i know he's dead, he knows it as well
<p> there's spunk and this boy ain't got it his disease is all he deserves and i'll take the crap, take the crap right out from him he's no heart, no nerve and i lie in bed and my love reads me poetry now that's what i, she's what i call an angel and so all you slags, you stay bitter and lonely talking pathetic lives, ah just get to hell 'cos you do not know fuck all bring me the head, the head of the stirrer i know he's dead, he knows it as well
<p> she and her mouth, a problem held dearly feeble little girl, whose ignorance brags rivers of sick flow from her freely she lives in a world of invented facts and his ears burn as he listens to shit stir mouth ablaze, bits of sex in her teeth his eyes aglow, his face ugly and twisted there's naught up front, even less underneath 'cos you do not know fuck all bring me the head, the head of the stirrer i know he's dead, he knows it as well and if you say that, if you say that again i'll be around and i'll kick you in if you say that, if you say ought again then i'll be around and i'll kick you in if you say that, if you say that again i'll be right round your house and i'll kick you in
<p> and lo! on the fifth of the sixth born to be stiffed by the ethics and quarrels that loathed to see him resting on his laurels he said "fuck your morals" was his own man for bad or worst an also-ran spawn of the cursed by sick fate and finding love a test would surely dictate that he would pick hate and time would prove a weapon his crime would be to breath the air he would stain the sheets of the black country
<p> and in good stead for later life he made the bed, his future wife was cookin' a soon come life for them, as she was lookin' at the ruckin' a class mates ears in either hand on to the tears he did expand with spittle the spite inside the phlegm was uncommital but pre-marital and the pome it had been tasted 't was the homophobic, racist flirt that she would wed in the black country
<p> within the snare of wilted flowers she rushed to share her youthful hours with learning that tolerance and reason are for burning he's not for turning and once upon ago, the sex would pretend not to know the hex of violence the days it would plot treason, drunk on silence (potent alliance) and a thorn he'd always carry still born is what she asked to be got divorced from hope in the black country
<p> her sell by date it came and went stood at the gate of heaven, bent on boredom born and bred qualifier for whoredom he got the chore done he'd borrow cash and grass his pals and scratch his rash and ever shall be a user the empathetic liars down the boozer 'll say they love a loser but overpriced is such a friendship thank christ, he drank himself to death he was a boil on the arse of the black country
<p> the despair that had been suffered offered no prayer for the belated death of that ugly child in the black country no, they'll mourn him not in the black country
<p> Bristol Road leads to Dachau Don't ever believe that you're safe There's someone, somewhere gonna show you how Willing to spill blood to get their own way
<p> From Birmingham via Belfast to Belsen You're going to get burned to death No such thing as innocent Someone wants to confiscate your breath
<p> A girl and her friends went for a drink The whole pub got blown sky high Why those people? I just can't think Do you think she was lucky not to die? (She can't walk now She can hardly talk now)
<p> Bristol Road leads to Dachau Murder by tens or thousands, it's all the same On't think Auchswitz couldn't happen now To think somebody could stop the game Stop that game Stop that train Those are not bakeries Those are crematories Those are not bakeries
<p> I'd like to ask you sir about the quality of life getting higher oh please sir can you give me the objects I desire? of course you can't, that's not the way things are its a bit of a shame, but the nature of the game and if you wanna play a part you're gonna get a broken heart I know you'd like to make a start but of course you can't
<p> there she goes again, the girl that I fancy please sir can you make her feel the same way about me? of course you can't, its not the way it is its a bit of a drag, but you can't have this and if you wanna play a part you're gonna get a broken heart I know you'd like to make start but of course you can't
<p> - bring it on in son, bring it on in son bring it on in son and we'll break it all down red light, red light I sit here laughing, you stand there and frown give me your question, I'll give you your answer is that your question? well, no you can't have gimme gimme gimme, can't have - of course you can't, that's not the way things are its a bit of a shame but the nature of the game and if you wanna play a part you're gonna get a broken heart I know you'd like to make a start but of course you can't
<p> there it goes again, the dream that I fancy please sir can you conjure up that kind of life for me? of course you can't, its not the way it is its a bit of a drag but you can't have this and if you wanna play a part you're gonna get a broken heart I know you'd like to make a start but of course you can't
<p> hello, does the voice sound familiar? does it sound like a journey back home? You're always going back back beat, let your feet do the talking oh, you know the sort of thing it's nothing new
<p> hello again, do you want to make friends? you know its easier this way we both know where we stand we all know what to do it's so easy our feelings are mutual return journey is a ritual
<p> well, well, well, all change no-one knows what I'm saying they swamp me in echo they keep me out of reach it's so easy for them its so easy you know, my arms have a limited stretch and I can barely grasp and I can hardly feel I just know enough to realise we can't fail so I just go home I just go home a safe journey return journey
<p> Life's a pearl set on gold indecision Big, bad world creates no recognition Youth is shining Scope is screaming ideas to the daylight Silver lining Hope is dreaming, up For one so young, for one so free No curtains hung, no history Guitars are strung with mystery, for you
<p> Sing of joy and the cynics go a-hunting But listen, boy?the barbs and spikes mean nothing Trails for blazing Stars are beaming visions through the darkness Rules for waiving Futures dreaming, up For one so young, for one so free No curtains hung, no history To rush headlong into the sea Guitars are strung with mystery, for you
<p> "Must get myself a box of matches" was a song made famous by Frank Sinatra a classic in its time, that's come again adopted by the new wave of smokers a mature ol' wheezer, smouldering geezer recall him as a fag you're lighting but a well known doctor is informing, "be careful what you put in writing" the fruit machines are all regulated the beer you drink is nearly all water and modern film just goes downhill that 'better lock away your daughter' is pure shit, do dismiss it and make your own choice in life's indian I mean, meat madras and boiled rice is nice but remember that's only my opinion
<p> (Doo be do) I like a joke as much as the next man that's not to say the next man is a joke and I don't like his jokes the content is as clich?d as his delivery. he's unpretentious, yes, but selfish you try laughing at his expense.
<p> I like a drink as much as the next man, or approximately as much, I mean, let's not get too serious about this, there's no use in crying over wasted words. poor thing hurting for amusement oh, can't you take a joke? oh, can't you see the funny side? don't you know this is a joke? ha ha ha take it like a man take it like a man, up the kilt take it like a man, don't be filled with guilt take it like a man, like a big tough man, take it like a man I go ha ha ha
<p> Your life depends on it over and over again Pop goes the cop shows, I shop you all, I am your friend The trouble is he fancies my best friend I'm worried and I'm sorry, worried that I'm no help I'm useless at times, useless at times like this It's a fair slap pal, fair slap pal, that kind of thing.
<p> Giving up sulking is as hard as stopping smoking I sit in the right hand side of the pictures watch but undecided about the culprit the motives and the script, they could lean either way
<p> Got lost for three hours Ended writing like I've read Outside the clouds cleared up, the lucky they cheered up those without will nor reason just peered up opened their mouths, learned the words live and learn
<p> dunno why they don't look down, they must be lunatics or something Nah, just slow, nah, they're just slow enough Vocation, don't know what it tastes like let alone how to smell it Vocation, dunno what it tastes like let alone how to spell it I T ha ha ha I T ha what use are you? I T ha ha ha your life descends on it IEAOU Vocation, don't know what it tastes like let alone how to spell it I T ha ha ha your life depends on it
<p> The tables are turned and there's other wheels in motion A dose of your own is always sugar-coated My fingers are burning but it's not a test of strength I see you fall back on fear Look for something that you understand
<p> The shoe's on the other foot and those words seem so throwaway The claim to what is right is always out of reach The glove's on the other fist and the rules are re-unwritten I just lie in wait of the day you'll try to understand what I mean
<p> Maybe it's more than words, or my words aren't up to scratch But this method of communication always seems to hit me back And there's a strange hand on the wheel I feel a new script on the cards Control and understanding are just two things I seem to lack
<p> And now the tables are turned and there's other wheels in motion Another man's humor is always hard to swallow My energy's burned but my capacity remains in tact I lie in wait of the day you'll try to understand what I mean
<p> wallowing in the muck and ignorant to the facts from the pathetic boulevards to the council prefabs pictures of the king in every hall a solid reminder on every wall that in a two horse race against a hair from his face a close shave but you run second father brother mother sister no good sperms are better than others lie back while we try to discover why
<p> a pat on the skull for unripe fruit white dullards in search of roots regret the day they found their truths now get down boy and clean my boots it is only a fashion, an attempt at being modern but modern for those is strictly secondary father brother mother sister no good firm is better than others lie back while we try to discover why
<p> amazed by the scope but abused by the limit goshing and wowing all over the shop you're growing a garden of nice green isms endlessly(?) discussing what to stop or start but down in the mouth when dirty fingernails speak yeah yeah it's another second father brother mother sister no good worms are better than others lie back while we try to discover why
<p> USE YOUR LOAF * turned sixteen, offered the key to middle age, a job at the bakery where flunkies dated packers the bosses got to date creamers and the jokes were handed down like diseases I learned all three, threw them away but I remember them even today 'I only work here for the bread' 'I need the dough' 'use your loaf' I thought go around this time came phrases new longer words but with the same old bracket people speaking for generations wearing clich?s on their jackets gang mentality, individuals calling themselves we so desperately wanting to be loved by the world they are wanting to say, 'here's your chance to win a car' be household names who have paid their dues too scared to move
<p> ...to be continued at a later date watch out for- tortured sights sick humour 'I think we should feed the world's starving millions with the world's stray dogs' I only do this for my head I need the dough use your loaf
<p> The type of person attracted to flypaper They've got words like magnets, all of their own Needles and knives blend into the wallpaper They're looking to be the unfortunate Rolling Stone
<p> Where memories consist vaguely of sleep They're cool in the winter in the right clothes The shoes that leave blisters upon their feet Their habits and preferences everyone knows
<p> Those wonderful people attracted to the toilets Hypnotized by an imaginary watch A fine looking corpse is found in the press Don't like the flavor but still drink the scotch
<p> Still memories consist vaguely of sleep It's cool in the winter in the right clothes The shoes that leave blisters upon their feet Their habits and preferences everyone knows
<p> The stuff of dreams for nice young boys As they close their eyes now and then Spot the empties, hear the noise Forget the taking(?), start over again
<p> Drink a glass of champagne To the misery and pain Things like getting the bus Oh life is the worst With the ever rising price of cocaine Trying so hard for a smell of the fart In an all out effort for maximum claim to fame Claim to shame, claim to the same
<p> Those wonderful people attracted to the toilets Hypnotised by an imaginary watch Fine looking corpse is found in the press Don't like the flavour but still drink the scotch And Kestrel lager Writes glamour reruns Of tangerines for Christmas In modern slang Shang-A-Lang
<p> the second well might bust a gut the guilt, the ego, the time limit brought about by age-old lies born from the dream of pale blue skies They bust a gut to find a face to wear But the big dilemma's always there
<p> too wired up, too scared of sweat the open pores that smell of death too paranoid of being taken for a ride we have become mean and I mean to decide before too long but my ear's hear the big ones eerie song "between you and me and I'm serious there's an osprey's nest in our back garden I'm worried about it, worried stupid bout the eggs I think why our garden of all places? I wonder sometimes is it true? urban ospreys sound quite interesting but how can I put it into use?"
<p> another world might lust for crumbs but you spilt my pint, now buy me another I have the pressure of day-to-day living What on Earth can I say to my lover? The two of us we lust for crumbs OF care But the big dilemma's always there
<p> too far gone to try and hear the open gob that smells of beer but it all falls into place in the end, you know this kind of stuff so ponder, ponder what you've heard the big dilemma's mighty words "between you and me and I'm serious there's an ospreys nest in our back garden I'm well blown by this fact but worried stupid bout the eggs I think why our garden of all places I wonder sometimes if it's true urban ospreys sounds quite fascinating but how can I put it into use?"
<p> prayers answered with our wonderchart fool mothers and daughters and the pounds will look after themselves allow your viewers the thought that you think them intelligent the climate is dull - use it keep harping on about the recession no one will really give a damn in a year or two so there's nothing to lose
<p> here's another soul sick drone born and bred in a great British home another slice of half-baked ideas to amuse your gramophone the climate changes to suit the weather but I don't know, don't know whether music is just another term for noise i'm told it's all about expression so express yourself boys i give a percentage of my earnings to the publicists strike fund there's something admirable about a thief they're searching out fragile hearts selling the blood of foreign parts to Better Badges for the fans to keep 'em happy and clapping their hands and we can just laugh it off in a year or two so there's nothing to lose
<p> Like pigs to the slaughter, laughing all the way Keeping your mind off things Don't notice the light of day Its the second bests ok by me show Big laughs at little jokes Private ponds on wayward paths Coolly lying low as blind bait, well out the way "Give them the idea that they're fighting us And we've got them beat without any fuss" We've caught your local peeping tom Now would you care to help with the collection We need your cash for our defence In the extreme case you make the connection That the splendid things on offer just mask the misery The rapist is excused once more, he learned it from TV Oh the cover up, are you frightened? For gods sake answer the phone Tell him that you're not alone
<p> (Long to reign over us)
<p> More swine to the slaughter, shouting all the way "Aren't we the lucky ones? we got a scapegoat for the day" Wearing slogans on their faces, like 'No mind rules my head' Your working class pride gives the power To those who keep you dead Its blind faith, plain ignorance Keep the damage away from home And the damage won't cut too near the bones
<p> there's certain places for certain faces always bills to ease the conscience always mazes to saved faces there's trad routes to share with your friends I get a paraffin brain at the mention of your name
<p> at the table cut the cheese a disturbing noise for the bourgeoise sex shops! sundays! don't hit back! but now the blow up doll sits on the point of a tack ha! paraffin brain, paraffin brain I get a paraffin brain at the mention of your name
<p> previous unreleased diary entries with in-between time, TV time, refried bean time, silk sheet time but in the meantime-
<p> day one: I thought this gave me some purpose but the repetition of it all is tiring me out. is it too late to turn my luck elsewhere? day two: dunno what got into me yesterday, it's so easy this life we all play. why start at all just to give up? day three: it seems popularity leads to indifference; I used to take the car downtown, but what can I do now to bring the town around? day four: I can see the humour in being a law unto myself, it's just I have to lie and that's what I'm scared of. day five: jeez, caring's getting out of hand. let the brats wail, let the crippled crawl. what I supposed to do to make it all better? Day six: I don't want to be a martyr to a long-lost cause. Everybody is loved. Why do I feel guilty? I'm not to blame. Day seven: I've been thinking about it, I'm special to me, why stick to tradition? Shoot the past! shoot the past! day eight: no, you lazy bugger, get your bloody finger out, because playing privileged is playing possum. day nine: got it! both! I must try to be the perfect person. sometimes noisy, sometimes quiet, sometimes hard and sometimes frail. day ten: I'm too tired to do anything today.but, tomorrow I'll start my diet and answer some of my fan mail.
<p> hadn't realized that I wanted a war sees misled unity, there's blood on the handle of the door and blood for dirt in polls beats game for a laugh top television whispers vive le psychopath and its chanted in bars, sipping continental lager but belching British breath that will get into your eyes and it'll change your mind hadn't realized
<p> see here, you want babies, you want beer look here, why brew babies, why brew beer you want sex and drugs and choice, then don't choose death use your loaf and don't vote death
<p> yes to none of this bet on the wrong horse your cash and your trust put on the false one and at the starting gate the so called sure fire and they sure will fire will you cheer them on?
<p> why then do you want babies some people don't have gardens some people have never seen dirt some people lust to fondle dirt some people fight for dirt I say give everybody the right to dirt give everybody the right to live and we demand cheaper bus fares now!
<p> we have surplus, we have scarcity famines are good news for dealers the sick heart of food economics the good news of the failed harvest (?) starving provides a cure and not prevention
<p> plenty has brought us not utopia but the economics of the madhouse the first depresses third world prices cash loans to pay for food, yeah all your eggs in a foreign basket leads to economic dependency
<p> food aid can mean dependency food aid, no self sufficiency food aid to take away for when food is a commodity aid leads to commercial markets and support for political policies
<p> we have surplus, we have scarcity and if you can't pay you're not interesting to this world system tens of millions hungry each day the outside can not be depended on need self confidence and self reliance
<p> IT'S A CRACKER * The finger points at shop floors for petty thieving Exemption shines up where the big leagues talk To get 'em worried i.e. get 'em believing That right as rain's the way the privileged walk. Keep one eye cocked for minor offences Support the hip hypocrisy of crime Big stealing pays to build up the defenses And gives authority above the question why. Where struggling competes with smiling The arguments inherent in the soup kitchen When it's a good old time for sighing There's no backing down without giving in. The finger points away regarding violence Unlawful exercise in physical force Pit 'em against each other build a fence And give the reins to him on the police horse. Keep one eye cocked for personal preferences Handy pandemonium if and when required Get it filed away give it a reference Glossy authority beyond the question why. When struggling contends with smiling Looking to take all that you've got to give It's a good time for striving If you're not ready for dying, you'd better live.
<p> Continuing though I've dried up I guess I know no other way I've been a joker for years, a joker for years I feel no pain in my funnybone And yeah I am success story Listen to shapes and talk about them (?) I've started so I'll finish Just one more drink before the bar shuts Big hands, I've (?) so 'll finish Another (?) before the scene cuts I who have nothing, born the son of a carpenter I had to work, I carved my way through life By word of mouth, an angel for a wife And now I've got a reputation It's a nice ache that's keeps me keeping on
<p> It appears that there's an increase in access to and so an increase in usage of heroin in England of late now I'm aware that we can turn into unemployment and look at the government yeah let's cast a scowl I'm aware of censorship and do support free choice but it seems ridiculous with heroin's history that its chosen and held, it's coolness long since gone along with the spirit of its supporters Saying hI to dependence is sheer dickheadedry Money and a slump, round and round we go again Remember marijuana don't lead to heroin Use your choice like you don't choose to chew razor blades I find it sad so here we go with a reinstatement, Singing, I'm the kind of guy who finds it sad I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemies now But it's hard to come to clean in the present situation Its as good not to bother, standards need reevaluation Redistribution of spending its said, like where are those grants Instead they leak out heroin, now that really is bad news
<p> Lets meet this chap I know, who wouldn't hurt a fly I'm told a cockroach takes him unto the limit It's a fear of increase which he perceives, not so with dope leading to harder drugs now In fact it's the law that stops him from taking action to prove the opposite dopes legalization might, just might, provoke him to point a finger at the scum that's making from it now Just wait for a death and the sting it may bring Wait for death and the sting it may bring To put a stop to this daydreaming The usual price, the usual price and the poor will pay to chase the dragon, the new bandwagon, don't even know its name Get the shit off the streets, smoke in authority Comes a time when free choice kills The usual price, the usual price and we watch as the poor flock to pay now
<p> Well at the end of the day hear the call when all's said and done and there's nothing at all gather around the fireplace with hot chocolate in hand my uncle owns a theater so let's form a band
<p> well it's all back again what a scream getting punch drunk on mouthfuls of a gaudy new dream I got too much to think, there's a girl in my soup my daddy has money so let's form a group and let's go
<p> as the leaves turn to brown bang on cue (let's fall down) and that something for nothing gets put in a stew when all of the things that could do go wrong well I'm feeling unhappy so let's write a song (sing along)
<p> being at one with your own better self is more comfortable than being left on the shelf the gaping silence never stops to amaze so let's eat some toast to those better days
<p> well its all back again what a scream and that something for nothing is back on the team get bitter and twisted and read into this yeah read all you can and there's nothing you'll miss (what is bliss?)
<p> at the end of the day when there's nothing at all
<p> HOW TO AGE * Listen well, cause this story tells how to age Just sit and watch and the day goes by - how to age Take off your clothes and get in the swim, be all the rage Get on the role and take it on the road, singing "Time's a cage"
<p> Growing up is no real problem, just wait and age God gives life and God gives earthquakes and cut throat razors But they'll never know how hurt you've been - its how to age And that's your real consolation - yeah how to age
<p> I sit and watch with most average eyes, watch and age I sit and smile as the time goes by, its how to age And that good time we had that's long in the past Well it seems like yesterday And I'm never ever gonna let it rest - how to age
<p> Worry not, don't set yourself up in a state A fear of death by experience is outweighed Yeah God gives life, God gives earthquakes and disposable razors But shaving of your unsightly hair is just one way to age
<p> It seems that chequebook journalism is all the rage Save a few quid on your grocery bill with a front page The scum tactics that put you in a spot, each and every day Be a fat old bag or a mature man, that's age these days Take it away.
<p> WHICH HI-FI ? even the big start small, kicking cans around the block full wallet walking tall, have to protect what you've got
<p> well I'd like to leave mine to charity but heard nasty rumours in the family loving favours asked in haste oh what's the secret of my case? as care unheard of comes to town descendents follow me around and I thought I had time left still dig the problematic will and oh if the world was in tune my value it would decrease ha ha ha the world in tune the possibilities increase
<p> use cash to save the people knowing about this hell I'm going through some chance, my advisors keep on showing me the things that I could do like save it for that far off day relatives expect so much as they mourn you passed away he always was a soft touch and always remembered his friends cracked it smart but kept his roots read - always a means to an end smart my arse! cries for the loot
<p> I thought of starting my own circus with life's contradictions vegetarians with cats, oh life's contradictions see elephants hang from the top of the big top the knife throwers don't know when to stop clowns that'll make you cry, the muscle man as funny guy an active sort who stays in bed, a lion's mouth with chewed-up head gags of sex and politics to 'I only came here with the kids' sidesteppers of the tightrope, mice scare tigers, fire eaters choke someone's legalizing dope, some hope cos ideas are castrated small you don't fuck about with the economy clinking coins walking tall so back at home with a family
<p> my father recommended this accountant he did well for himself, my dad he died recently of alcohol liver but left us the best times he ever had a life of my own, admirable idea the cause is grateful, life expectancy nil there's no looking for the second coming oh no here comes the barman's till a swift one afor I go - our fee for this show is five hundred quid that's ten weeks on the dole finance! wow! the nightingales lift the lid
<p> no worthless gift for a child's Christmas, don't waste their time with this year's hula hoop, just give 'em time so there's your stumbling block, like what is time? where does space begin and end? grown ups twist, go santa claus
<p> self-imposed serious mystery, knowledge is the quest knowledge is the quest, experience he know best so don't do what you can't understand you're a child, just a child events take place that make you a man you gotta be reasonable but wild crap ugly ducklings against the clock go on and rock around the clock let's rock against the clock come on and rock, rock, rock against the clock
<p> happy Christmas is around again but this year it's not the same they say "it's for kids really" as they grope for hangovers, adult stories so tell me when is doing nothing the same as doing something? the answer - to get to the other side and when is a bus not a bus? when it turns into a street oh excuse his little joke he'll grow out of it, give him time get into his little jokes you'll get into 'em given time you gotta give 'em time
<p> Takes one to fuck things up a mistake to live with forever and this stupid thing brings home the truth you are never to sing through happiness its always handy when in need of an excuse a weapon in the darkness
<p> a type of thing capable of burning leaving ashes hotter than the fire it's like a suicide, the damage is done the knowledge that you can't be right case proven, apologies never won a stain in the daylight
<p> a connection that can never be cut ridiculous(?) song, the lyric is useless when the damage is past repairing a connection that can never be cut
<p> heart in the open flaws
<p> the stench of those ashes is masked by no perfumes the stale smell of regret it's like a suicide, the damage is done the knowledge that you can't be right case proven, apologies never won a stain the daylight heart in the open flares heart on the line
<p> Well, did you hear about the Irish man who opened a tandoori restaurant He did quite well for himself, it was quite a lucrative line of business And he was competent where it counted, Sing well done underdog! And she was OK after all, well done, underdog! She ran a shop and started riots, saying "Here folks, take back your money" To social pleaders with no idea, she said "Give 'em your arms honey" And I for one, I'll struggle on, chewing on my hot dog And though the bun be stale and the mustard hot, The meat doggone under done I eat in Birmingham where the council has just passed a new resolution That from now on they'll plant thinner trees So muggers they can't hide behind them And believe or not, I'm a-told it's fact I mean, blimey, when we talk of pressure But, here's something that'll cheer you up Did you know they have free phones in Cuba?
<p> I'm a cynical fowl clucking around the farmyard brain eating food for thought, shitting all over the place my memory's like a sieve I can just remember big feeds, big greed, big mistakes and so I've given up competing with the pacesetters the big cock's they crow the loudest blah blah blah but I'm an arrogant fool messing about on the motorway brain beating fists full of words in my mouth I stumble around like a loser with a grudge big stage, big step sideways or one tiny step for one tiny man one big zero for mankind So why do I bother? I've always hated teachers' pets I don't think dogs should be made to smoke cigarettes I don't want to hear the ballad of Mott the Hoople halfwit tunes to amuse the lesser people but I'm still a useful tool serving a function pretending that if I'm aware there is no need to care the choice is all my own, I can lose if I want to I'm a big jerk, a little star(?), a touch short sighted So here am I crawling with the pacesetters and the big cocks still crow the loudest down on the farm (let's hear 'em crow now)
<p> We're useful tools, keeping things down by pretending that if we're aware there is no need to care, as we sing it's my party I can cry if I want to I can cry if I want cry if I want to So here we are, we're doing what you expect us to and the big cocks still crow the loudest down on the farm cock-a-doodle doo
<p> Set me free, please, quench my thirst Feed me, I want to work I'll walk to work, I'll walk to work There's a clever double meaning there, do you get it? You're so brainy, so stupid, hungry and dirty You're an idiot, it's understood, brilliant and lovely You're so sloppy, a singer of the words Do you call that singing? What a funny guy, so sexy, so perverted You're a vampire, an ogre, so ordinary You pay your debts, you look your best, live worthily You still believe that it all happened Believe a bearded bloke is your friend Don't you know there are only acts of genius? You're the son of God's mate

<p> the time had arrived when all but a few left wing councils modernised their towns and villages with American names but Victorian rules Scotland for example was Mexico the festering capital was called New London and those from the north wanted to work hard for pay for a harmless standard of living decide through tradition their attitude but I think we'll forget that one forget that one and go down south now
<p> born and bred in platesville a wealthy suburb in the other lands found down the drag from middle they could not mistreat the cows quick enough the demand for milk was tremendous in a two kids each home situation the fatter the kids the better but boy, those workers are gonna need to graft twenty four hours a day to make enough sweets and biscuits for our kids but several blocks away the brats were grouping up for yuletide no it isn't that they did not like tangerines or feel ungrateful towards their families but this year they were heard to say "lets have an airgun between the lot of us"

<p> those kids with sweet sticky fingers failed couldn't get to grips with sharing it's a shame but I can dig it, I suppose but life is what you make of it give or take a train driver and the eyebrows raised by my friends at my tales but these episodes have brought me neither joy or benefit, now
<p> I could make you feel bad but what is the point? I'm here to make you happy, to love the sound of your voice I could remind you of the past Of those days, get your bags and get out But its now and there's no struggle So don't milk that doubt Leave it out

<p> The hard choice in the supermarket Between Eeal Lemon and Jif The sentences that we're liking to hear That end with the word but or the word if We could talk about past Of those days, get your bags and get out But it's now and there's no struggle So don't milk that doubt Leave it out
<p> COMFORT AND JOY * OK then intro?we'll pick it up in the alehouse, they're doing afters whole lotta chatting going on there's little thirst but less going home background?tangled lives set to music and pop whose function was never more fitting paid for by those with no-one to talk to or more likely the joy of lifers at the top and stuck for a next move our man is one such lifer it's only once so take your time in the past he'd spent some time in prison a subject that had recently risen 'twas going down well-disturbing and hilarious the man embraced for drinking sour milk then all the more when he mentions his divorce First up the "you're better off" stuff Then the gaggle of bloated advisors Disguised in drink and drunk on family life Talk of hostility towards others Love and change, heartaches and courage Depressions and dreams In a basic and colorful language Row about we're all in the same boat It is random, it's ironic These companions working on friendship Hearts in the right place, between the head and the feet His mind runs away with itself Other people's voice, empty glasses He's off into the cold light of day This gives a vague idea of what he has to go through Down to earth, day by day background Optimistic About drama, let the story unfold One thing's for sure, you'll soon get the picture Just a minute to get down the road Saturated by booze, sexually frustrated A reality he's manufactured This being his kind of man Oh god and America, the voice of the tempter Says "I think you have an obligation To look sort of what you're supposed to look like." Culture grid springs into action Association and experience Diapause (?) and fantastic fantasies Better the desert that's familiar Than the plot that you don't know No content makes for lots of room Our man at home could appreciate such space Double time and no contentment Psychic drive meets law and order It's about time to get fed up He rubs the corners off his appetite Purity versus ambition "Horrid thoughts?you have to laugh" Is the latest thought our man's had Learning seems at odds with relaxation Common sense and evergreen bread However abstract go for affection Recognize the rules and grease the palm Perception and expression, love, life and law It's a watered down thirst for knowledge Up to date, no news is good news Baby boom/sugar culture?I'm in the denture business I said 'crops," I said 'cash" and I'm smiling? Things that are useful encourage support Who needs the piss poor poets pain of love? Another's heartbeat banging on the free spirits drum Integrate or isolate Change contends with happiness Full of beans and fit to drop Puffing and blowing Up the wooden hills to bed Inevitable anti-climax Our man is not a riveter He was one but changed his mind We could all use a little luxury Speed and range, comfort and joy Cue nostalgia?behold a baby boy? The good lord smiled the dya The nurse told his ma to get back to eating for one Born to a household with all the top items Water, heat and food and so life goes on
<p> Knock coincidence out of a/the window Cracking godsend groovy chat Page the heavens for a lovers fleshy heart Caveman institution rules ok The late and greatest party on the move Big names, cold hands, gimme That carpet surely needs a clean Kick coincidence into the standard head And oh god, cold god, craving faceless friends Sincerely, oh god, yeah, sincerely yours Brick in all of that which constitutes a thought Unless its a stolen one The pot that always seems to call the kettle black This one, it will run and run Print a hundred or so magazines Schoolboy, strange kid Shit he surely knows about the groups Kick coincidence into the sexists mouth And oh gob, old jokes, leering Mindless mates humourously go choke Yeah you really are a card Hey let's poke the waiters patience in the chest Yeah let's all enjoy ourselves Casually insult the girl whose drink you bought Caveman money sense walks on water Backdated and racist ideas on the move Big pain, no brain, give up That thinking needs a sudden death Kick co-existence into the standard head And oh god where's the whiff of magic That contains completely nothing in the way of power
<p> After a video session and a laugh and a joke I'm ready for shut eye proclaims the host to his mate A dopey paranoia, remembering maybe The opening scene from 'I Spit In Your Gravy', and its late With visions of violence all the way home The morning streets announce he's all alone, swaying round And the front door approaches and there's tea, if not milk It's like the closing sequence of 'As Smooth As Silk' He sits down Shaking hands with memories of double vision The last draw and a read before breakfast television It's at that stage Signing at nine so may as well stay up A new book (?) with tea in the cup, turn the page Of a slim volume of horror stories titled 'Cooking For Cretins' Featuring ghoulish recipes with few stories thrown Tales like 'Crumbs', which turns out to be his favorite story With la la la lunacy in the bakery And the aforementioned 'I Spit In Your Gravy' Boy it's dumb and it's almost unspeakably gory
<p> If you are able to sit on the saddle comfortably With the ball of one foot on the ground And please sir if you're gonna treat us like infants We're probably gonna behave like those nippers and shake it on down The fortune it was just one of the aims And to be a winner in those power games (?) and his other personal (?) The strangeness that is all part of the show The appalling footage in the pop video, it's the pits But relax and let's do the new dance
<p> Visions of violence all the way home The morning streets announce he's all alone Swaying round, all the time, swaying round And the front door approaches and there's tea, if not milk It's like the closing sequence from 'As Smooth As Silk' He sits down, feeling great, not too late He sits down
<p> the unimaginative see pinstripes but the shorts are just plain navy blue in them the polite liar cuts a dash the opposition now comes into view the easily pleased see embroidery in the shape of the letter i on the bullshitters red trunks it could be anybody's fight who would care? who would care to guess? what on earth will happen next? the house is full up to the brim could be they've let too many in what support the polite liar has jeers at the gloveless bullshitter looks in the mirror and cracks it his fans think that is fantastic 'its easy enough for them to get by' is captured in the polite liars smile ah, there will be no fight, nor any refunds the square circle, mans relaxation
<p> the fib fans save up for golden robes as worn by these top liars with names on the back, loaded furry dice the ref announces he'll retire but picks up his cheque on his way home the unscarred fighters hit the bar a square circle and a pint of foam the high life of the sporting stars
<p> Hello and welcome to Birmingham It's the Big Heart Of England We are multiracial but two-faced Here in part time moral land If there are a lot of catholic votes around They go anti-abortion And claim their taxi fares to go and eye the prostitution He said "It's incredible" - what the lowness of the price? They are parallel with the pimp scene Ooh the thought of his wife So consider your vigilante force blessed by your local big wage earner "And give yourself the right", he said, "to modify behavior" Regional immigration of this type is not wanted On a basic level it makes the streets look messy And, strange but true, The smug righteous crowd have reasons for complaining Some local women, with kids with futures, yeah, they find it paining Men of tender conscience, when it suits them Say, if it's local, these women are an eyesore Oh, these streets, the barter of relief The young 'uns need a break, they wanna get away from it all On an 18-30 holiday - designed for the pick up Are you too old, too bent or too broke? It's great, after the first few hundred quid you don't have to pay a penny (?) idea of hard work Are you solving the problems of someone who treats you like dirt? Kiss the enemy Well, Hello and welcome to Birmingham It's the Big Heart Of England We are multiracial but two-faced, here in part time moral land
<p> curse the day that I was born I'm a band aid on an open wound funny how six months ago seems like a year back and those yesterday is a crock of cack the previous five minutes brilliant I am with kids in tow talk in holy retrospect evil little memory I'm to the government and made myself an enemy and then the news on the radio had a lot to say tried to poke me off the fence which I thought I would paint grey but no I get worked up but no can do I wouldn't want to run the risk different skin give me credit for nonsense my contrived and caring words if military if you want to work with milk I hope you get a job in a dairy if you want to be clever with words buy a rhyming dictionary if you want to sing like a canary rewrite well that's what I'm saying now and there is no pain got to wash my mouth out but here is my heart saying I can't play piano and I don't know any gags russia fags I got so much duty free I can hardly shut my bags oh my god is that the time? summers here and the competition's high
<p> God can it be true I know that face? The cigs it gave one for later just in case The morale in the team the piss we took We broke that bastards back, But, he laughed and we shook when he said, "Care not for my life Your petty principals are the all important lot Find employment for yourself in messages But watch your head you'll laugh it off"
<p> In the pub some talked with glee of his end "All those fags he gave for naught, He was round the bend. And those final words on which he choked, We will have the last laugh at that joke, Yes F to good and bad, just give us perfumes to block our biased stench, His words came out of his bleedin' arsehole" (Cough), "If you'll excuse my French"
<p> A bad day for the news hence his spread Its got to be bad to report the dead Twas his smile that caught me though he'd put on weight I think I'll dream of him tonight at heavens gate, Saying, "I see it as merely inevitable That I've reached the final stop The bus of life ran out of fuel I lost my head, I laughed it off".
<p> I'm told the world is round, that I don't need to see it for myself I missed my 'O' levels because I could not will myself To keep one eye focused on big print Couldn't get ambitious about graft So as time ticks over I begin to try and educate myself I know what's on the cards so let's start to worry about health Buy the book of medicinal big print Take direction from the old big print
<p> I'm told that modern culture is digging a grave for itself By a group who look as though they have risen from that grave themselves Punching paper printed with big print Nice pale paper with motifs in big print But give me black and white
<p> I got the slightest feeling that I might not be exploiting myself I might not do much good but then again I'm not beside myself And I'll be hanged if I'll join in the chorus How can so few words create such fuss?
<p> So getting nowhere quick but that's the present state of information I'm told it's getting better by a gaggle getting in formation To wax lyrical, but prissy, in big print But start at the beginning of big print Existence. Black and white.
<p> THIS * How is this found? IS the question asked But there's no right royal reply Is there no time to be relaxed? Is it just yer old pie in the sky? Captives of the think are caught Believing others are void of thought The most modern captives of them all Remold concern dissecting all This cannot just be
<p> Of course there is no equal base There's always right royal replies The angel concept is out of place The lazy day crawls up and dies There's so much work and unto who? A proffered peaceful death in lieu? A worried mind a martyr makes Fear of harrowing give and take This is too easy
<p> (But the shop's too far and the giro's late and the spare time is boring the shops too far and the giros late and the postman's a bastard give him a uniform the two channels clash and the videos bust. the services are dire, they're too interested elsewhere Oh, those others spoil this.)
<p> Ooh, knowledge and sunshine and others' opinions An itch in the conscience or soul Drab statements in a dull dominion Something to fill in a hole Well, day to day is alright for some Those looked at with eyes, some dumb Say "getting by is a piece of piss" It can't be much harder than this This makes idle promises
<p> (It must be anal or phallic, some sad satisfaction Do me a favour, give him a surprise To be grateful a push is required But pity be a non starter, get to grips and fuck this Spoil this)
<p> For a first option I don't think you grumble I mean, I can't knock it The happy medium Got geeks who'll clap it And creeps who'll wrap it in their own photographs The happy medium A future of disappointments But it all went to plan He be a very reasonable man The happy medium But the reasonable bloke has become a big joke In the elitist bars where the stars are The happy medium But for a first option you can't complain Don't be a whiner, turn it in guv'nor The happy medium
<p> Hark my love, they're playing that tune They're wearing our clothes, whispering our secrets A man and his woman, cutting closer to the bone Believing is the mistake, leads to head and not heartaches Halve my whole, it's a lifetime of trials We are in this together, stooping lower than ever
<p> Some moments of beauty, ones of trivial strength With some memorable climbing, with no effort declining Halve my whole, it's a lifetime of trials We are in this together, stooping lower than ever
<p> Household frights are made together (?) Going at it hell for leather (?)
<p> two ordinary, not remarkably humble, talk in words of not long left of televisions finger on life's wrist responding to a whining pulse an accepted realism, resigned to entertainment and fair enough they'll say the enviable task of hosting a beauty contest remembering a history
<p> so what's the struggle? what's there to remember? what can you build on? heaped plates of worry it's a bellyache problem for the men of the world interpersonal bickering learned down on the ranch look raw and find an enemy
<p> these two hard boys, they make good actors but struggle with crap scripts shit theatre meets the video nasties andy pandy golliwog minds banana brain, one of the bunch normal and not remarkably nice projected heavy handed and empty headed mouthing told ideas
<p> oh, shit drama, the pub politicians monday morning footballers these two cowboys, nothing but trouble finicky about their food hard done by, garlic ought to be shot shoot out and find a target hard done by, garlic ought to be shot belief in the articulate
<p> fascist idiots bred from security secure education fascist idiots, bred for security choice cuts from history like the lunatic with admirable guts and the enviable task designing pretty dresses, deciding tone of flesh he's a bit of a rough arse the same two cowboys with no jobs to go to join the police force "you wanna know where Broad Street is? well, what for at this time?" oh god only knows the installation of this ignorance the soap shy jokes jokes oh god only knows the reasoning of this ignorance nothing but trouble
<p> imperialist cowboys ordinary and remarkably unhealthy shout in given accents bigoted claptrap, Radio One speak of smells and uses and hair color and sporting miracles all the cause for the cowboys to think twice in one day minds occupied by
<p> don't start that lying down blocking my way I understand the dream of safety have common sense as regards the future that of rearing children, et cetera but in this fib of peace time, "to be ok pal, protest and survive" patronize time, entertain the mind with video games, but there's your reason a progression, the one step too many so come the day all nations agree to get Paul Daniels on the job worldwide disarmament is a meanwhile relief reconstruction no problem, we have the technology
<p> don't begin to call me paranoid I'm smiling now at a speck on the horizon have common sense as regards interaction and of course I love my mother but in this fib of peace time with a told need to protect and survive that in itself says we've come too far we're careless of consequence and of others feelings just rocking and a reeling, can't sit still but come the day all people agree to get Paul Daniels on the job belief in the magician is a futility remarkable powers are out of place in democracy
<p> reminds me of the TV weatherman a household face with a forgettable name he had access to film and camera he could have a perverse nature it said so in the stars the day he read 'em this could be why he has no inclination to use the medium he has access to or maybe it's his lack of imagination who's to say? who cares anyway? whatever the reason he never worries about the choice, he don't even consider it tomorrow could be colder or warmer so what's the point in complicating things further?
<p> ok I admit it, now get out of my way I'll hold your hand and I'll dream of safety stop telling truths if they're not pleasing and join the queue to get on the telly shouting slow change from the inside deny that terrorism's terifying patronize time with a prolonged life talk of not wanting monsters destroying our planet I mean, we've come this far damnit so come the day all monsters agree to get paul daniels on the job get him disappearing technology and chants of get back to the trees come the day all people agree to get paul daniels on the job belief in the magician is a futility remarkable powers are out of place in democracy
<p> for the sake of argument, we'll call him bob he's all tied up in getting on tossing and turning about what to put in and what it's all worth to replace
<p> bob thinks there's nothing, nothing clever in being clever nor being stupid just get on course for a future that's lucrative
<p> the secret of youth is disinformation secure something that'll take its place bob says "who'll love the old man who grumbles? who'd throw away stuff that'd make perfect jumble?" he has mixed feelings about charity he'd like to buy his own home
<p> the trouble starts with arrangement and where on earth to put it the problem continues with how to get hold of things
<p> bob reckons that a thing of value, it should never be mistreated he doesn't go for property is theft dunno if he leans to the left he has a limp, an industrial accident; the boss didn't look too concerned
<p> he landed on his feet, met a nice bloke an older chap who claimed to know about life but bob, it seemed, could not convince his pal that a future would prevail it seems it was ok as it stood but how far would his friend be prepared to go apparently these days trust is very hard to muster
<p> worried sick, he takes time off his new job to have a think about what's in store he changes somewhat in character (but not as much as he thinks himself) bob goes along to see his doctor says, "give me something that will make me sweat" so the doctor signed him off bob starts to worry about death
<p> this in turn it leads to worse things like defacement and robbery bob thinks more and more about his friend he feels he needs more security "at the end of the day brian, we're just not being positive. at the end of the day brian, what reward can I expect?"
<p> you might never need anything but you may as well be safe most words are there in the dictionary, it's just getting it off the shelf oh, what a hassle, what a hassle this was only ever embarked on with a promise of a payoff, if and when, but bob wins some and he loses some.
<p> the whys of acknowledgement acclaim but what is the point? pay the rent and look for friends a just means unto an end acclaim for making people happy an alligator sandwich and make it snappy and popularity it comes easily popularity it comes easily there's a ready-made market for what you can do ripe home made pie for what you can do see the affluent part-timers they're building moats around the gang-children's castle never contented at giving up stuff but, potential it ends easily yeah, potential, it blends easily
<p> there's a ready-made market for home improvements a clean home made by rearranging the newspapers, or whatever, turn the page, a choice selection, create impressions, look for friends, just a means to an end a class problem of projection, the political problem of rejection
<p> the luxury of it all, never having to explain things very old definitions of clever greets the new outrage the spidercrushers make number one a good chance to save and the people are in no way surprised basking in the belly of good times
<p> the whys of acknowledgement special? well, there's a sore point acclaim for making people happy breaks the pin that holds the nappy pop popularity give it me, simple as abc no pretense of a right or wrong just get 'em to sing along
<p> heartfelt cries in chains the family deals they build on old ground best for you i.e. best for they after all this to leave now? the pressure of saying goodbye to single figure logic and rot righteous groupings my family - forget me not
<p> I feel constant gain nowhere to return a wonderful sense of loss nowhere to return

<p> I couldn't say it was just men, generalizations are wanton Though there is maybe something about the dark of night Still generalizations are wanton in bachelor land Can openers and launderettes, but generalizations are wanton Those I was drunk following days, well generalizations are wanton In bachelor land I wouldn't say all marvelous things are futuristic or in the past I've seen stunts done with the body, I've heard jokes that have made me laugh In my bachelor pad in bachelor land But even martial arts masters must have some washing to do And someone to do it for them Guess there's no point in feeling blue in bachelor land I reckon there's a safety clause A stereotype to take it from The dos and donts and excuses and a crude claim on freedom That's bachelor land
<p> he wasn't much of a fighter, so he wore a big hat but he weren't too careful with what he'd say he was a crazy man, he was a crafty fag tomorrow is another day to a crazy wag and he's a crafty fag
<p> says "what you don't take sugar? well, I've put some in already but I feel sure it'll be alright, I'm a cheeky chap, I'm a lazy lag it'll be alright, right on the night it's a loopy gag and I'm a crafty fag"

<p> Too pressed to stay on top, keep a mental scrapbook. But the favor sold are mounting to those who bear to look. Those brainwaves we have had; talk about coincidence. Stake a claim in the game, meaning up is it. Just take people's friendship and take their hospitality, taking it all for granted, take the generosity. Be part of their family, ponces all are we. We are all family, pompous all are. Give out addresses, know of any parties? Flash flash flash your wallet, won't have very far to go. Crap for anything that's free, hang around, you'll never know. Those owls have had a compromise, could be leading to a go. With all the family, ponces all are we, one big happy family, ponces all are we. Up spoiled background, someone always will provide, a dropout intellect, that arrogance has made you blind. We are all family, ponces/posers all are we. And hail all this, everybody do the disco stop, hail, do you see anything you want? We are all family, postulates all are we, ponces all are we
<p> As long as money talks you can't buy the truth As long as money speaks you won't hear the truth In the first case, I am assuming corruption I know you cannot work out a fair price And, second, those upholding chatty coinage Must have motives kept disguised and that's not truth Truth is plural
<p> Pleasure is an inspirational act They pit pleasure against the conscience To determine what pleasure shall entail They take one man's word and turn it against him So people will require distress in comfort Pleasure is pleasing to accept, distress needs learning And the idea of education, When devised with this in mind, Makes the untold easier to swallow And the idea of tradition, when devised with this in mind, Makes their taught laws easier to follow So surround the pupils with your folklore This requires no groundwork by the students Injections of learning supports the fascist mysticism Which balances the principle of pleasure with one of achievement This achievement can be faded out in the long term To leave them helplessly in place And wanting money, needing exchange So is money the sole downpressor of truth? We can watch cash's effect but downstairs live the causes The causes are true realism, but this is a problem Money can mask the causes, which in turn could kill cash So, we try to make a pleasurable living Masks above death before birth Back to square one.
<p> Grab your partner for a chat, no one can argue with that Lie together, be a party force Words of future, situation divorced How things could be in a stammer Is there life after the cough? Smash a sickle with your hammer Talk a donkey's hind leg off
