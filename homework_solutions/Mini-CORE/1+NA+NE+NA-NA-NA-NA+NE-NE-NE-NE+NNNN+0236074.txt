<p> Ya, both parties and their loyal ideologues better put aside their party allegiance and start activation their allegiance to constitution they sworn to. They were elected to protect interest of the country of the nation and not that of a group of vultures called lobbyists.
<p> He pretty well laid it out. The common belief that all rich people are republicans is simply a myth, but the Republican party is willing to commit political suicide over them and the rich Democrats are more than willing to allow them to proceed.
<p> Ridicuous comments on both sides! You sound like a bunch of children. There are rich and corrupt people on BOTH sides of the aisle. Why don't we all face reality and quit electing the same people over and over again. The problems we face are too serious and blaming political parties without action is just compounding the problems. Stop the name-calling!
<p> The problem is that republicans think that they have a mandate because they maintained control of the House. But they lost the popular vote in the overall vote tally for all House races. At best they have a "gerrymandate" from gerrymandering (cheating) to get more seats even when they get fewer votes for House seats. Losing the popular vote, and then claiming a gerrymandate becausee you gerrymandered the districts in a bunch of republican states is pretty weak.
<p> Bill Kristol continued: "Really, the Republican Party is going to fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic and half of whom live in Hollywood?" Thank you, Bill. I haven't seen it written any clearer than that. Why don't our Congress people understand this simple plan?
<p> Time for Washington to cut the Pork from all the Pet projects that were sneaked into bills the Congress voted for in the past. Start from the inside out. All the perks that congress gets should be taken away and they should pay for their health care. Congress pensions are way out of line with the main stream and should be modified. But we know that won't happen because all their Perks, Salaries and Pensions were voted in by who else....The Congress. Shame on them.
<p> If we got rid of all of the pork spending, all the legislators pension, we would still be WAY over spending. There are only four programs that matter: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Military spending. Everything else is minor.
<p> How come we can't get either party to stop spending so much of our money on stupid things, cut down on what they give away, and really figure out what is necessary spending and what is not, and go from there? What is wrong with that? It sure seems that they won't even entertain the thought. I truly wonder how many citizens realize that the money they spend is our money taken in taxes, and that its our future they are spending. All these politicians and their families are set, no matter what. It seems to me that they have no skin in the game.
<p> Do you really believe sports stars are for tax increases? Look how many professional golfers live in CA vs Florida and tell me they are in favor of paying more taxes. Tiger Woods has actually been vocal on this very point.
<p> Each party is controlled by radical special interests and they'll be gridlock for the next 4 years.
<p> Immigration has enabled liberals to get elected and Republicans sign Grover Norquist no tax increase pledges and nobody wants to negotiate anymore. Congress use to be full of moderates. Who's moderate now in the House ? The Senate had 2 in Sen. Collins and Sen. Snow but the Republican party hates moderates and eventually the moderates throw up their hands in disgust and bolt the party. Same thing in the democrat party.
<p> Issues like abortion and immigration, gun control have polarized Americans and while we're bickering over the issues we're destroying ourselves financially with excessive debt.
<p> There is the other alternative, just wait until it all falls apart. The Middle Class pays the majority of taxes in this country. When they quit buying goods and services because wages are flat or non-existent, the 1% will finally realize they need us. Henry Ford was called crazy for cutting hours and raising wages, but he got it. People without jobs and money do not buy. Cutting taxes on the 1% will not increase jobs. Give more money to the middle class who will spend it! Eliminating the tax deductions on the middle class will just hasten their demise.
<p> The government should be raising tarif taxes with a consumer protection law to prevent consumers from footing the bill for it, that would force corporations to move their manufaturing back to the U.S. After all, we are the largest importer of goods, use that to our advantage.
<p> would rather see the hold thing come crashing down rather than extend the Bush tax credits one more time. Where will we find 10 trillion dollars to pay for them? The burden has been pushed on to the middle class and poor. Time to end this nonsense. Better that we are all poor before my son becomes a slave.
<p> When Romney's daddy was CEO of AMC he paid a tax rate of 44% and the country was booming. Junior Romney pays 14% and whines that he pays too much. To think that Mittens spends MORE each year on his wife's dancing horse (and DEDUCTS the cost since the horse is a TAX SCAM) than TEN middleclass families gross income combined is a SIN! Romney's daddy did NOT have off shore tax shelters in the Cayman's Switzerland and corporations in his wife's name in Bermuda! Conservative BIll Kristol has been correct! Kristol said all through 2011 that ROmney was unelectable! And Kristol says it is time fot he GOP to stop defending "a bunch of millionaires!" VERY few Americans make over $250,000. The Oligarchs have trained the American sheep to protect the the wealthy on the very long odds that they hit the lotto!
<p> The rich will come up with ways to use more irs deducations. The rich will just hide 90 percent of their money in other countries like china. Congress does not have to worry at all , they will just vote them selves a bigger raise each year to off set being taxed more. It will be a win lose game.
<p> Especially since the CBO just reported that the minor tax increase they will see - back to where it was - will not have any significant effect on the economy - unlike the middle class portion of the tax break.
<p> It's embarrassing enough when something bad happens to you if there are people around to witness it, but take that to another level: Imagine getting arrested in front of a news crew while you're being interviewed. That's exactly what happened to 18-year-old Reilly Neuklis, who was arrested shortly after the car he was driving collided [...]
<p> MELBOURNE, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tiger Woods's taxpayer-funded visits Down Under did nothing to help Australia's ailing golf tour, which is stuck in a losing battle for relevance unless it does more to embrace Asia, according to five-times British Open champion Peter Thomson. Woods's tournament appearances in Sydney and Melbourne over the last three years brought crowds and media attention to Australian golf courses not seen since former world number one Greg Norman was in his prime. Any hopes that Woods had put Australia back on the golfing map, however, were specious, Thomson told Reuters. ...
<p> Whoa, trouble in TriBeCa! It seems that the tony downtown Manhattan neighborhood's two most famous residents, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle actor Robert De Niro and Beyonc's husband Jay-Z, recently had something of a public spat. Well, it was actually more one-sided than a spat, as De Niro did most of the talking, scolding Jay for not returning his calls. ...
