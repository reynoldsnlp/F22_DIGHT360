<p> Here's another video of Pat Smith, the mother of slain State Department official Sean Smith, demanding answers from the Obama administration on what happened at the American consulate in Benghazi where her son was murdered on September 11, 2012:
<p> "Smith says she received personal assurances from President Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that she would soon know how her son died," says the reporter. "But now, one month later, she says nothing--not even an autopsy report."
<p> "I want to know. I want to know what happened," says Smith. "I told everybody that'll listen to me. I told them, I want to be told, I want to know exactly what happened. ... Tell me the truth."
<p> Smith adds, "Our country is looking stupid in front of the world because of things like this. We have no [security] protection."
