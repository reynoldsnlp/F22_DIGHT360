<h> A House Is Not A Motel Lyrics
<p> Verse 1: At my house I've got no shackles You can come and look if you want to In the halls you'll see the mantles Where the light shines dim all around you And the streets are paved with gold and if Someone asks you, you can call my name [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/love/a+hous\\... ] Verse 2: You are just a thought that someone Somewhere somehow feels you should be here And it's so for real to touch To smell, to feel, to know where you are here And the streets are paved with gold and if Someone asks you, you can call my name You can call my name I hear you calling my name yeah all right now
<p> Verse 3: By the time that I'm through singing The bells from the schools of walls will be ringing More confusions, blood transfusions The news today will be the movies for tomorrow And the water's turned to blood, and if You don't think so Go turn on your tub And it it's mixed with mud You'll see it turn to gray And you can call my name I hear you call my name
