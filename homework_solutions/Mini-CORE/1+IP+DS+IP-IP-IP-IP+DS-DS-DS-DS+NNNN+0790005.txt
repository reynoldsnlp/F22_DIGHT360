<h> Review
<p> Review from Manchester Evening Post - A colourful look at a wonderfully cute black and white subject. With engaging text that sheds light on the cuddly looking creature's way of life. Bless. --Manchester Evening Post
<p> Review from BBC Wildlife Magazine - A diverse array of excellent photographs covering so many aspects of Panda life. the images are accompanied by succinct captions, and each chapter has a short but useful introduction. A well presented book with stunning photographs and sound text that should appeal to anyone interested in the species. --BBC Wildlife Magazine
<p> Review from Amateur Photographer - Whether you are a fan of Pandas or Heather Angel, this is one book not to be missed. --Amateur Photographer
<h> About the Author
<p> Heather Angel is a biologist and award-winning wildlife photographer who has made many trips to China to photograph the wildlife, plants and natural landscapes. She has written and illustrated two previous books on pandas. Heather runs her own photo library, Natural Visions, which you can view online at www.naturalvisions.co.uk
<p> This collection of photographs from Heather Angel is outstanding, the book rich with beautiful images of the panda in its natural habitat. The glossy photos chart the animal from feeding to playing to resting, and include some amazing shots of the panda in the snow in winter. There are also a few shots of the surrounding mountain ranges which help to put the panda into context. The accompanying text is just enough to explain the activities of the animals, but not detract from the central focus-the pictures themselves. At the end of the book is a delightful chapter on the red panda, a less frequently photographed species. Overall, this book is a treasure that you will want to look at time after time.
<p> Excellent Value 4 moneybook.Would like to see Larger Paperback Format with PANDAS photogaphs/Mountains in background Sichuan looks stunning this would be a Brillant adition to anyone who loves to view The Giant Panda in its natural habitat.
<p> This is a photographic book of pandas and is jam packed with lovely full colour photographs of wild pandas and even includes a section at the end with pictures of wild red pandas. Would have been nice to have had more text information on wild pandas but it is a lovely book anyway. The photos follow through the year of the panda.
