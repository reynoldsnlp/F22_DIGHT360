<h> Few grins from grim Kimi
<h> HAS Kimi Raikkonen become a caricature of himself?
<p> Perhaps it was to be expected that the enigmatic Finn would not exactly dance on the table with glee after he won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
<p> But his responses to questions put to him by Lotus's own PR people were so downbeat you could be forgiven for thinking he is living under a cloud as black as his Formula One car.
<p> Friends who know Kimi well insist the 2007 world champ, who returned to F1 this season after a two-year break, is a laugh-a-minute away from the racetrack.
<p> But see what you make of the Lotus question and answer session...
<p> Q: How does this win stack up against your previous 18?
<p> A: To be honest it's just another win on the list for me. It's great of course because it has been a few years. But the wins prior to this one were very similar -- we didn't have the best car but we fought and still won. It's great to win now so people will stop asking me if I can win or not. At least it makes it a bit clearer.
<p> Q: Is it good you've answered that 'when is the win coming' question?
<p> A: I never cared really what people think. If I don't finish the next race then they'll think I'm as bad as that race. I'll just do my thing and if I'm happy with what I'm doing and it's the best it can be for the team, then that's that. So I really don't care if people are thinking differently of me now than what they did three hours before the race.
<p> Q: Tell us about your emotions as you took the chequered flag.
<p> A: I'm happy but there's nothing to jump around about. We still have a few races to go. I'll try to do the same again. For sure, we had a good party. I'm just happy for everybody in the team.
<p> Q: How long will your celebrations of this win last?
<p> A: I have almost two weeks. As long as I manage to get myself to the next race I think the team is happy. Maybe I will try to get home at some point.
