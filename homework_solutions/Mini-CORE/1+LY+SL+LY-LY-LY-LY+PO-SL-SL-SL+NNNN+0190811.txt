<p> [Avant] I been looking for you for a long damn time But you been gone away I nearly lost my mind And now we're in the club and you're grindin' on me, touchin' on me, got me goin' crazy That skirt you wearin' got a playa on stroll As I glance at my watch I see the night is growin' old I start to reminisce about when we were shorties, back seat of my jeep, yes I'm feelin' horny As I play my position posted up on the wall Happy to hear the DJ say last call 'Cause what that means is we about to leave and I'm about to be all up on you and you up on me
<p> [Chorus] 'Cause I want you And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what But I want you And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what
<p> [Avant] It's hard to keep in touch while you're off in school But now you're right here we can do what we do Start in the car and end up in the livin' room Kiss around your navel while you're on the end table Pushed the magazines down on the floor, I'm your soldier so I'm ready to go to war And you told me you're hot and you're ready Your legs won't stop shakin', just give it to me daddy And I like the way your body's lookin' right there Knowin' we might not even make it upstairs And what that means is just relax your mind and baby let it flow 'Cause it's goin down and that's for sho
<p> [Chorus] 'Cause I want you And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what But I want you And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you (let me) And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you (I will) And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what (holla)
<p> [Lil' Wayne] Get fresh off the G4, need no intro Weezy baby nympho, him so gentle with it Still got mami limpo Little woody put his thang down like Mutombo Young dude, rich, smart, humble Got something down low to make your walls crumble Not rough though, slow-mo, promo We could go video... uh oh (true... that's right) Nasty that's all in me How he rappin' got women like he R&B (bull shit) What you know about your legs in the air, with your head in the chair, and my hands in your hair (ow, woo) We could go there if what I'm sayin' sounds fair Don't trip, I kiss every lip don't flip Flip up the doors on the out-of-country whip I could take you out of this world baby... let's dip
<p> [Chorus] 'Cause I want you And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what 'Cause I want you And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what
