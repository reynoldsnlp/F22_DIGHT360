<p> The pain of a protracted legal battle with his former manager and the release of being allowed to record again after a three-year layoff are equally apparent from the piercing hard rock and harsh lyrical content of Darkness on the Edge of Town . Betrayal and hard work that comes to naught are the primary subjects on his mind here, evidenced by songs such as "Adam Raised a Cain," "Factory," and "Streets of Fire." Elsewhere, there are signs of hope or at least the possibility of outrunning your problems ("Racing in the Street," "The Promised Land," "Prove It All Night"). But mostly, these are songs about exorcising some serious demons, and from the sound of things, Springsteen's loud, lonesome howl and blistering guitar work went a long way toward making him whole again. This is angry art, made by someone pushed to his absolute limit and more than ready to push back. --Daniel Durchholz
<h> Product Description
<p> 1978 album from the acclaimed American singer/songwriter. Includes 'Badlands', 'Something In The Night', 'Prove It All Night' and more.
<p> one of if not my favourite BS album. from the opening lines "lights out tonite, trouble in the heartland..... i don't give a damn for the same old played-out scenes.... my fave line "for the ones who had a notion deep inside, that it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive, gonna find one face that ain't lookin' through me, gonna one place, i wanna spit in the face of these badlands...... to the final track, "nobody asks too many questions or stare too long at your face............." raw & gritty, classic springsteen, everything in his heart from his upbringing spilling out here......
<p> Bruce Springsteen has always have a strong personal integrity. He has always gone his own way in life. Against his father, and against the music buissness. When his father told him to be a lawyer and his mother wanted him to be a writer, he wanted to be a rock n' roll star. So he did. And got in trouble with his former manager, Mike Appel. Mike put him into a slavery contract, and after the fantastic album Born To Run, he wanted to break up from that contract. It took 2 years in court to break up from it, and Mr Springsteen was really angry. He wanted to go his own way in life, as he always have done. The result can you hear on this awsome album, probably the best album he has ever done. This is the punky Springsteen! Joe Strummer couldn't have done it better. On this album, Springsteen hasn't a star producer, cause he didn't want to. He let Jon Landau, a former music critic from the Rolling Stone Magazine, produce together with him. The sound is simpler and more raw, but it fit with the anger and strength in the songs. The songs are totally awsome! Do I have to say Badlands? What a song! A timeless masterpiece! Always something to say to us, even today! Full of hope and optimism, but also anger and strentgh. Factory: A song which is short and seems to be not much of a song, but listen what Springsteen has to say in that song... It's awsome! Adam rise a cain... Listen to the anger in that song... Racing in the street is wonderful as a ballad. Candy's room: Listen how nice Springsteen describe the prostituted woman that he met. He's a true human guy! All songs are fantastic! And if you really want to know how good Springsteen was that year, listen to the Winterland Night bootleg! Then you know how really awsome he really is...
