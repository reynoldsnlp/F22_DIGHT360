<p> [Chorus:] Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side) Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side) Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side) Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)
<p> My mamma told me there'd be days like this And man she wasn't foolin' 'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss Uh uh huh You opened up your mouth with baited breath You said you'd never leave me. You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss You're cryin' me a river but I got to get across
<p> [Chorus]
<p> I'm lookin' for another kind of love Oh Lordy, how I need it. The kind that likes to leap without a shove Oh, honey, best believe it. To save a lot of time and foolish pride I'll say what's on my mind, girl You loved me, you hate me, you cut me down to size. You blinded me with love and yeah it opened up my eyes [. From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/a/aerosmith-\\... .]
<p> Lovin' you has got to be (take me to the other side) like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side) My conscience got to be my guide (take me to the other side) Oh honey take me, take, take, take, take, take
<p> Take me to the other side I'm lookin' for another kind of love Oh Lordy, how I need it. The kind that likes to leap without a shove Honey, you best believe it. Now I ain't one for sayin' long goodbyes. I hope all is forgiven You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover You know you had it comin' girl so take me to the other side Take me to the other side, take me to the other side
<p> Lovin' you has got to be (take me to the other side) like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side) My conscience got to be my guide (take me to the other side) Oh honey take me to the other side
<p> Aerosmith Fan 09/24/12,14:57 I love this song sooo much that I can't stop listening to it. I think it means that Steven found love with this girl and Steven wants her to take him to the other side with her love. Rock on Aerosmith!!!
