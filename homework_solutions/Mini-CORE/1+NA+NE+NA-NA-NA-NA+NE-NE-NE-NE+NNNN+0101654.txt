<p> Mr. Sanchez, who is bilingual, will contribute daily segments to the network in Spanish and will also host several news specials a year. He will be based in Miami.
<p> Before making the move to Noticias MundoFox, Mr. Sanchez had been a contributor to Fox News and Fox News Latino, the English-language Web site that creates content for American Latinos. Mr. Sanchez anchored the election night coverage online for Fox News Latino, which was in Spanish, and will continue to be a contributor there.
<p> "I'm excited about MundoFox especially because MundoFox is really about the conversation that we've had about reaching out to that highly interactive first-, second- and third-generation Latino who resides in the United States and who, for the most part, have not been represented in the dissemination of news in the Unites States," Mr. Sanchez said in an interview.
<p> Mr. Sanchez, a very active user of Twitter, said he hoped to use the platform in his new role. "We want to make sure that we were not just talking to viewers but allowing viewers to talk back," he said.
<p> Mr. Sanchez, who has been a vocal critic of the lack of diversity in the news media, said he considered the rates of diversity today "somewhere in between weak and deplorable."
<p> A report on news staffing released by the Radio Television Digital News Association in 2012 found that while the percentage of minorities in the United States population had increased by more than 10 points during the last 22 years, the percentage of minorities working in television news had increased 3.7 points, and less than 1 percentage point in radio. "If you turn on the news, anywhere on any channel you'd be hard pressed to find us," Mr. Sanchez said.
<p> "I still believe it's very important to include Latino perspectives and to have representations of Latinos when it comes to news," he said. "The things that we offer are the very things that can keep us from having the catch-up conversations that we are having today about the election," Mr. Sanchez said, referring to the coverage in both English and Spanish news outlets about how more than 70 percent of Hispanics voted for Barack Obama.
<p> In 2010, Mr. Sanchez was fired from CNN after he commented during a radio interview that Jon Stewart, the host of "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central, was a bigot and that "everybody that runs CNN is a lot like Stewart."
<p> Days after he was fired, Mr. Sanchez apologized for his remarks saying he had "screwed up" in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of "Good Morning America"
<p> "I said some things that I shouldn't have said," Mr. Sanchez told Mr. Stephanopoulos in the interview. "And they were wrong. Not only were they wrong, they were offensive."
<p> In August, MundoFox, a partnership between Fox International Channels, owned by the News Corporation, and RCN Television in Colombia made its debut in 50 cities in the United States, including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York.
<p> The network is vying for a share of the growing population of more than 50 million Latinos in the United States. Univision is the dominant player of the trio, with Telemundo a distant second.
<p> When asked whether it made sense to add a third Spanish-language television network to the mix, Mr. Sanchez said: "The audience is big enough. The numbers bear that out. If we can handle however many English language stations in the United States, we can certainly have three solid Spanish speaking stations."
<p> Online advertising shifts to follow consumers online, the BBC's legal woes mount, and how both sides in the conflict over Gaza are using social networks.
