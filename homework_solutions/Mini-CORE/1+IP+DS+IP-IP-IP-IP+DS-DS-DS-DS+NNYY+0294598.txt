We only get one face and body, so it's up to us to take great care of it. You have to pay attention to your appearance in order to keep it looking nice and fresh.
<p> Protect skin from sun damage, dryness and roughness using NiaSerum 12% Niacinamide Serum, to buy and for more information, CLICK HERE .
<p> As we get older, our skin needs more and more complex care. There is not just a need for moisturizing creams and lotions, there is also the added concern of the small wrinkles and lines that begin to appear on the complexion. Added to the aging mix is the loss of elasticity that our skin undergoes with the passage of time and the tendency for the pigment to be uneven with red or dark spots on the face as well. There is actually one skin care cream that can address all of those problems listed above as well as many more.
<p> NiaSerum 12% Niacinamide serum has many quite impressive effects, and it is a topical treatment that can be used by anyone at any age of adult skin. What is NiaSerum? And how is NiaSerum different from other skin blemish removers on the market?
<p> Niacinamide is formed from natural vitamin B3. It is a safer alternative to many of the other blemish removers for sale today. It is not a harsh chemical, like benzoyl peroxide, which can be damaging to your skin. However, it is just as effective, if not more effective, than some prescription strength acne creams.

<p> When 4% Niacinamide cream was compared to 1% clindamycin gel in a  controlled randomized test, 82% of users of the Niacinamide showed an improvement in their skin and acne, versus only 68% of those who used the clindamycin gel. However, the 12% Niacinamide serum is more concentrated compared to the cream -- in fact, more than double the strength at 2.5 times the level of niacinamide than the cream.
<p> Niacinamide Serum is designed to strengthen the skin's immune defense system. Our skin has its own immune system but as we age, we are exposed to sun damage and the environment, so our skin's immune cells tend to become weak. 12% Niacinamide Serum helps to protect the skin's immune function as well as improve signs of sun damage, dryness and roughness. Used as directed, it also helps even out skin tone and is an ideal maintenance treatment for hyperpigmentation. It is appropriate to use over the entire face, neck, chest and back of hands.

<p> In addition to being a great blemish remover, topical Niacinamide can also reduce fine lines and wrinkles. In a recent study, Niacinamide was shown to increase skin's  production of ceramides -- ceramides protect your skin against moisture loss which leads to aging. In addition, 12% Niacinamide serum acts as a skin whitener and helps to fade acne spots, age spots and other types of hyperpigmentation. It has also been found to be beneficial in treating rosacea.
<p> We all need a skin care regimen. Everyone, whether you like it or not, pays attention to the way other people look. If you're looking great with a well-kept complexion, you're much more likely to succeed. Not to mention it will boost your confidence. Get the picture? A fine skin care product is essential these days. Look your best always. Start using 12% NiaSerum today and see the results.
