<p> We drove for hours and we talked the whole way I'm so enamored with the things that you say You talk so sweetly I can taste it on my tongue You got me spinnin' got me feeling like I'm something special But I'm not sure I really am cause I choke on all my opportunities to say things right I'm gonna try it now
<p> What I wanted to say What I wanted to say was What I wanted to say was
<p> I love you so much I love you so much I love you so much What I wanted to say was
<p> We got to the city and you put your arm around my arm and held me close I felt so close and then I felt it slipping slowly through my fingers down my leg and to the floor like a sudden skipping Where the word, it gets away When we need it there beside my hand and on my lips
<p> What I wanted to say was What I wanted to say was What I wanted to say was What I wanted to say was
<p> I love you so much I love you so much What I wanted to say was I love you so much I love you so much I love you so much
