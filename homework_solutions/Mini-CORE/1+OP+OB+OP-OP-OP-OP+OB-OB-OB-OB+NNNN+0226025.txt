<h> The Internet will crush businesses more and more -- wake up!
<p> With the news that Clinton Cards is now a casualty of the Internet (see news HERE ) and the immediate reaction from my daughter that 'Moonpig have won' and also the news that Amazon are entering the Fashion Market ( HERE ) to bring high street fashion to us all, it is becoming more and more evident that without innovation and a Digital Mindset the leaders of our great brands in the UK have to wake up and smell the coffee or go bust. The responsibility they hold to ensure the latter does not happen is immense -- to all of us.
<p> The High Street will be hairdressers, coffee shops and charity shops, I looked around our today when I was walking to me train and I could see the writing on the wall for most of our retailers, thus increasing unemployment and empty shops will become so common that we will be in danger of being de-sensitised, be honest, do you feel the same reaction now when you here this news of large brands going into administration as you did when Woolworth's failed, we are already in danger of acceptance.
<p> I wrote a tweet this week, a reaction to two days of tough mentoring of SME's that stated 'it is not easy to be successful, if it was everyone would be'. A fairly basic thought, but the reality is that to innovate, adapt and survive it takes guts, hard work and the need to feel like at the end of everyday you have run a marathon.
<p> Change is the constant in our lives now. If we don't have the network that stimulates and stretches us, if we don't have the balls to get up and out into the business world everyday to listen, learn and adapt to this new world we will not survive.
<p> I ask in my talks I give, how many people are doing things differently in their business than they were 2 years ago and I am staggered at how few are. Deluded that when we are out of this recession we will return to the 'norm'. There is no normal anymore, this is the 'new norm', embedding digital in your business processes and thinking is essential, no longer pioneering, it is what you should be doing.
<p> Recently I spent time with a lady who runs a brilliant service on HR, a great small Business, a brilliant lady, providing advice on HR Regulations and steering her clients away from the risk of tribunals. Over the last few years her business has suffered, she does not blame the recession, she blames the free and low cost information being provided online by those who have already adapted.
<p> So what are the barriers to innovation and change. Is it hard work, is it fear, is it lack of motivation. The so-called  'Fat Cats' that run our UK Companies, are they not hurting enough to put themselves out and feel the strain of learning new tricks!
<p> There is no excuse for not being aware of the risks and the opportunities of the Internet now... Would love to hear your thoughts as I believe everyone of us can adapt our businesses providing we adapt our minds first.
