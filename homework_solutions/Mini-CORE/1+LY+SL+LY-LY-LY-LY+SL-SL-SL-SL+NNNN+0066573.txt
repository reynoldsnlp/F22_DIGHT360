<h> Most Of The Time lyrics
<h> Jim Reeves Most Of The Time lyrics
<p> I just burned the picture that you gave me I burned all your love letters, too I know that won't tear you from my mem'ry But tell me what else I can do
<p> I gave away the things that remind me I hardly ever mention your name Our friends never see you beside me But I know you're there just the same
<p> Most of the time you'd think I'm happy Most of the time there's someone new But most of the time I feel like cryin' And most of the time that's what I do
<p> Most of the time you'd think I'm happy Most of the time there's someone new But most of the time I feel like cryin' And most of the time that's what I do [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jim_r\\... ]
