<h> Do we need more hotels and shops?
<p> IN RESPONSE to the article about the region's tallest skyscraper, the monstrous Oceanique, to be built in the site of the former TSW studios.
<p> I wold like to point out several facts to the boss of Devington Homes, the same person who is building new flats in West Hoe. We already have hotels a short distance from the one you are planning to build. Also James Brent is planning to build by the Pavilions.
<p> SKY HIGH: The Oceanique building planned for the city centre
<p> Many people have written in saying we don't need any more student accommodation. It was reported on July 10 that the number of people applying to universities has fallen, due to the increase in tuition fees.
<p> We already have plenty of empty shops which need retailers to invest in. Also we have plenty of restaurants in the city centre, Barbican and the Hoe.
<p> Apart from that it will take a lot of light from the buildings in that area. Finally the people who were born and bred in Plymouth, also people who have moved here from other cities and towns, don't want to see their lovely city which is steeped in history ruined.
<p> Such skyscraper buildings are more suitable for London, or New York. We already have a monstrosity of an incinerator planned for Devonport.

<p> "yes if there is a demand for such why not ........but looking at the boarded up shops & businesses premises in plymouth (some of which could be turned into accommodations) the need for such is questionable ,but again it would give some work for building sector ."
<p> "Im not sure there isnt another agenda here. There are alot of BTL landlords who own Mutley plain/peverell/north hill and rent out to students. Everytime a new student accoodatiom like this gets built the competition gets harder.... combined with fall in applicants (due to crisis and increased fees) owning a Student let is getting more and more risky
<p> Just curious because in my eyes and recollection of uni life new halls of residence (i.e this place) are great for students as they newly decorated, up to date with technology (internet etc) and great for social networkings (10 flats to a corridor for example). Best times of my life were in halls.
<p> So on a student front i think if it was built it would be filled with students.... those students would have to come from somewhere and i think it would be the private student btl market which would suffer. Wouldnt be suprised if author was one of said BTL student investors."
<p> When someone post their views on a public forum such as this they leave themselves open for replies that may or may not have the same view as they do. My remarks towards Mrs J Kitching are regarding her views on the topic she posted. Nothing more or nothing less. They are not personal such as your and I don't stoop to have to use bad language like yourself. As long as there is this sort of mentality of the people that live and run the city then it will sadly never get anywhere.
<p> Like I mention in my original post. Such a shame that a city with so much potential going to waste. I'm glad I've moved on!"
<p> "We do not need more hotels and shops - we need more people with money to spend in the existing retail environment. However, that is not going to happen because the people who live here (me included) have little disposable income thanks to our c**p wages and we are very unlikely to attract Russian oligarchs or "shake yer money" from Dubai - live with it Plymuff !"
<p> "Theres nothing to draw people into plymouth the hoe is boring u have a lovely sea front but theres nothing up there a large arcadia would bring in people and tourist but there would be an uproar if that was suggested were to outdated hear no vision . bluebell"
<p> "part of business is listening to others......locals/outsiders see things in a different way than the actually people planning things for a city, this will include negatives that the planner SHOULD welcome and take on board. (maybe he will dismiss them but at least it should be listened to, who knows maybe they have a point?)
<p> but not on this site, everything has to be "yay, fab, this will be sooooo COOL!" any other response is met with anger......so unless you want to be shot down either respond with a "yay this is going to be great" or dont bother at all, is my advice."
<p> "It will never happen. Just like the North Cross tower, the Woolworths site tower, the Drakes Circus tower where that pitiful Jigsaw Garden is, and the 'mini manhatten' skyline that was planned from Mackay for the West End. Bascially these sort of towers are normally only built when the city is lacking floor space. Plymouth city centre is too big as it is, with ample empty retail space, so building upwards is not required. This tower will never happen and the site will remain a surface level car park for the forseeable future aswell."
<p> "It is quite obvious that the city centre has out lived its purpose, growing percentage of shops now boarded up with little chance of re-opening, ZERO 4 ground floor never had a single occupant, the recently refurbished Durley House now empty again. Shopping habits have changed, extortionate rates on businesses also exasperate the ability to compete with online and out of town shops.
<p> The City centre needs a complete re think - no point in building hotels if there is nothing to come here to do or see. Not much point in building a tower of any sort really if there is nothing to look down upon and admire.
<p> Even though it is not a pile of rubble the city centre is today an economic ruin although the buildings remain they are rapidly emptying and becoming defunct.
<p> This City NEEDS SOMETHING UNIQUE, the City Centre needs to be redeveloped not as more shops or hotels but as a Gigantic enclosed roofed in museum, southwest heritage centre, maritime centre, something people will want to come and see you can then intigrate this with other sites around the city such as Royal William Yard, South Yard, etc
<p> Build something people will flock to see and the shops and hotels will soon follow. At the moment this City has lots of potential but everything is disjointed and spread out like a broken jigsaw until someone sits down looks at what we have and what can be done with it to make a complete PLYMOUTH EXPERIENCE for families and visitors to come and enjoy hotels, more shops and tower blocks will just remain empty ramshackle ruins.
<p> Sadly the one thing that will ensure none of the above ever happens is funding or the lack of it guaranteed non starter.
<p> Shame really as we have a great city but no coherence and not much appeal to. The question is simple really why do people go to Alton Towers, Blackpool, Windsor, etc? Becuase they have places specifically designed for having fun and getting away from it all.
<p> The only crowd puller we have had is the PLYMOUTH eye and despite its sucess it is to go.
