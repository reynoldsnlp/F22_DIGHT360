<h> The American Spectator
<p> Thanks to Climategate, things aren't looking up for Ms. Henny-Penny, who will not be flying to Copenhagen.
<p> I knew Henny-Penny , founder and Recording Secretary of The Holy Order of The Sky Is Falling , had been having a couple of bad weeks, what with the announcement that the big UN global warming conference in Copenhagen was not expected to produce a treaty. Little did she or I know, however, that recent days would bring catastrophe to the entire movement that believes in manmade global warming.
<p> She called in great distress when she learned that Phil Jones, who heads the Climate Research United at East Anglia University in England, had stepped down while his role in Climategate was being investigated. Our conversation went this way:
<p> Ms. H-P: To make matters worse, Michael Mann, who was involved in a lot of those e-mails planning to manipulate data, is under investigation by Penn State University where he works. This is awful.
<p> Ms. H-P: I believed them when they said man-made global warming was a matter of settled science.
<p> Us: It never was. The "proof" is in the form of computer projections based on data considered to be insufficiently comprehensive by many scientists. Furthermore, Jones and his CRU colleagues claim the base data that started this process was lost or disposed of several years ago. Very convenient.
<p> Ms. H-P: But why would they falsify data?
<p> Us: No one knows for sure. The lure of big money might be one reason. Jones, for example, received approximately $19 million worth of research grants between 2000 and 2006. That's six times greater than he received for the entire decade of the '90s.
<p> Bear in mind that UN bureaucrats, egged on by the some of the members -- not to mention the most ardent environmentalists -- kept sounding the alarm that icebergs were melting, sea levels would rise and we would all fry within a few years. Their motivation? An international treaty that would bind the industrialized nations to sharply reduce industrial production while forking over billions of dollars to non-industrialized ones. All these grand conferences are intended to produce that result. It's social engineering on a worldwide scale. The state of the climate is only a vehicle to achieve it.
<p> Ms. H-P. I hadn't thought of it that way. When I first observed that the sky was falling, I contacted a scientist friend who said I might be on to something. He'd noticed that the average temperature that year was up a little and he thought there might be a correlation. He spread to some of his colleagues and it caught on. Why one of them, James Hansen of NASA, became a regular Paul Revere sounding the alarm. During the George W. Bush Administration he claimed he was being muzzled, but he managed to give 1,400 interviews and turn out many alarming NASA press releases. Now it looks as if the temperature data he was using was wrong.
<p> Us: Don't forget John Holdren, President Obama's science advisor. He's been an alarmist for over 30 years. In 1971 he predicted a new ice age. He said it would be caused by burning jet fuel, agricultural dust and smog -- all things generated by human activity. The ice age didn't happen, so now he's selling global warming.
<p> Holdren was also involved in a Climategate e-mail exchange. And, he sought to undermine the professional credibility of two physicists for papers they published in which they concluded there was not persuasive evidence to support the widely held view that anthropogenic (that is, man-made) globe warming is a fact.
<p> Ms. H-P: I am devastated. Before I called you I canceled by tickets for Copenhagen. I'm just too depressed to attend. On top of that I haven't been able to get through to our Pontiff, Al Gore. I was sure he would give me reassurance, but both his voice mailbox and his e-mailbox are full. He hasn't said a word publicly since the Climategate scandal broke.
<p> Us: Maybe that's because he's an investor in a firm that will sell "carbon credits" to companies that are over their quota. That would be a very profitable business if the Obama Cap-and-Trade bill were to pass the Senate. So, your Pontiff may be spending all his time in Washington lobbying. .

<p> Roy, it's the same in China...I just got back and every day in China Daily there was a new piece on Global Warming, and absolutely no mention of the fraud being exposed...and I was blocked from any internet source of information on the fraud...

<p> GREAT READING... as a child I loved my parents reading 'fairy tales' for me, even the scary ones.
<p> Henny-Penny was one of my favorites! I recall actually looking skyward occasionally.
<p> The Internet inventor woke from a dream one night with a start ... 'the .com and Enron scams failed because only private investor money was involved - limited supply. What if national governments and even the UN can be sucked into the next one - unlimited money. WOW!'

<p> $10 Billion Dollars & More per Year For a Fraud? Canadians are interested in results of what is going on about Climategate in Canada! As it has to do with our lives,lifestyle whether or not we are going to be living in a Democracy or under a Dictatorship? Jim prentice has stated & PM Harper advocates this as well otherwise Prentice wouldn't be uttering it"Canada will be paying it's fair share of Carbon Emmissions! To the tune of $10 Billion per year!" Really, we are already $70 Billion in debt thanks to Michael Ignatieff & the Liberals who up'ed the anti to the Canadian debt load on stimulus! This begs the question where Jim Prentice plans to dig the $10 Billion per year out of? Did somebody say more Tax? What is so disheartening about that is the fact that now it's been found that the whole Climate Emission scam has been proven to be Fraudulent as credible Scientests around the world who were previously locked out of putting their work and findings forth by Jones of East Anglia University and the CRU,were pushed out of the picture with thier observations and experiment results on Climate Change found that not only is the earth not heating up in reality it has been cooling since the 1960's! How much more fraudulent can this Scientific Data be? The United Nations and the Globalists are using this false Data at Copenhagen, to transfer our wealth to third world countries? Yet Environment Minister Jim Prentice and Prime Minister Stephen Harper feel so generous with Canadian Tax payer dollars that they are willing to toss in $10 Billion per year on the "hot air" that Ban Kai Moon and Pompus PM Gordon Brown and the rest of the Criminal Rogues that are involved in this bogus Carbon Emission Treaty! As the Bible says,"A Fool and his money are soon parted"! To request that PM Harper doesn't sign the Copenhagen Treaty, causing Canadians to lose their Sovereignty and Freedom email the PM at: pm@pm.gc.ca , Protest Copenhagen Treaty: http://www.gopetition.com/online/32485.h\\...

<p> What a crock! Al Gore isn't the only one who stands to make a buck off of this climate change party. Like a bunch of hungry hogs these elitists are bellying up to the trough and getting their fill. Meanwhile, US taxpayers hold on to your pants as they'll be about the only thing left, will be footing the bill now and forever.
<p> There will be 1200 limos for the extravaganza, and only 5 hybrid-electric cars. Limos are in such short demand that they are being imported from Germany and Sweden. One hundred and forty private jets will have arrived in Chopenhagen by the time the party starts. And best of best, 1400 sex workers, unionized we might add, will offer less than 'carbon free' sex to anyone that has a delegate's pass to the conference.
<p> Today a Drudge Report article states: "As well 15,000 delegates and officials, 5,000 journalists and 98 world leaders, the Danish capital will be blessed by the presence of Leonardo DiCaprio, Daryl Hannah, Helena Christensen, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Prince Charles. A Republican US senator, Jim Inhofe, is jetting in at the head of an anti-climate-change "Truth Squad." The top hotels -- all fully booked at 650 a night -- are readying their Climate Convention menus of (no doubt sustainable) scallops, foie gras and sculpted caviar wedges."

<p> There are so many holes in the henny-penny theories that it's hard to know where to start. First, the theory violates the laws of thermodynamics. Second the models use flawed 1920's equations to calculate how heat is radiated away when the sun goes down, and third , the code in the models biases output toward warming. As an engineer, I'm offended that so called scientists can keep lying about the data. I'm even more that those science whizzes Gore and Obama can actually be taken seriously by anyone with a hint of reason.
<h> Richard Baker | 12.7.09 @ 11:52AM
<p> The UN and academia are full of grant whores and confidence men. The Pandora's Box is open on these Frauds and they can't put their lies back. The certainty of a Ph.D is that someone, somewhere will fund the "research", such as it is. Or should I say "A Fool and his money are soon parted?"

<p> I've thought for a long time, and this has pretty well set it in mental concrete for me, that the Government has no business providing grants for any research other than that directly related to Defense projects (Manhattan Project -good, Climate Change - bad).
<p> Then, if someone really really really believed the sky was falling, he could convince a corporation that it could make trillions of dollars on preventing said apocolypse and they'd fund his research. At least, then, we'd know the researcher's bias when we read any reports.

<p> Oh great Engineer Owyheewine , thank you for advising us " the theory violates the laws of thermodynamics." and "the models use flawed 1920's equations to calculate how heat is radiated away when the sun goes down,"
<p> Now could you please write down the suspect equations and show us where they appear in the software?
<p> Failing which, just let us know what you've built, so we can ercct warning signs .
<h> Richard Baker | 12.13.09 @ 9:51AM
<p> Dacron Mather: Good message, that. I get the impression that some of these "scientists" writing in these forum think that the mathematics and physics are beyond the rest of us and that "incantations" of the magic words will awe us and thereby stifle dissent. Wouldn't you like to get folks like this in a classroom, alone, with a chalk/grease board?
<h> BarryMartin | 3.2.10 @ 5:57PM
<p> I'm really confused at this point on whether global warming is really an issue for us. We could be spending billions of dollars to fix a problem that doesn't need to be fixed. Obama will continue to push the environmental issues, and although I've benefited from Obama college grants , I'm not sure if I'm completely on board with this environmental agenda.
<p> I don't really see the need for someone to falsify data to prove that the earth is warming up! everyone alive around a decade ago can surely remember that it was a bit cooler than it is now! Somehow, the weather seems a bit whacked these days! Dale
<p> If global warming isn't man-made, then what causes it? A lot of natural disasters (mostly floods & bad weather) as been happening recently & I think that they are all connected to global warming & lack of respect for the environment!
<p> Somehow, the weather seems a bit whacked these days. I don't really see the need for someone to falsify data to prove that the earth is warming up. Everyone alive around a decade ago can surely remember that it was a bit cooler than it is now. And it will more hotter in the future than today. AEG Ovens
<p> The whole AGW scam as some put it seems to be a huge debate in the uk but not on the BBC's website, they are still forging ahead with their claims of AGW and there was very little reporting on the CRU leaks. Its funny how a story such as the CRU leaks can make the front page of most of the newspapers but yet buried on the BBC website, who seemed to write the story as a crime of hacking rather than any revelation of data manipulation, altogether very shady reporting by a supposedly impartial broadcaster.

<p> A very well constructed and written artiicle, thank you for posting this! You wrote the article in a very understandable way. I really hope if more and more information keeps popping up like this we can finally put an end to this "global warming" ruse and just move past it. Bill Philanthropy Customer Service Team
