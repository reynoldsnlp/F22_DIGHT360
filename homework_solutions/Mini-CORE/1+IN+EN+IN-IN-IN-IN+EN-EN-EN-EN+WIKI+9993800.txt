<p> The lyrics of this song are written from the point of view of a person who is disillusioned with events in life that are supposedly unique experiences. The singer tells of witnessing her family's house on fire when she was a little girl, seeing the circus, and falling in love for the first time. After each recital she expresses her disappointment in the experience. She suggests that we "break out the booze and have a ball - if that's all there is", instead of worrying about life. She explains that she'll never kill herself either because she knows that death will be a disappointment as well. The verses of the song are spoken, rather than sung. Only the refrain of the song is sung.
<p> Jerry Leiber's wife Gaby Rodgers (ne Gabrielle Rosenberg) was born in Germany, lived in the Netherlands. She escaped ahead of the Nazis, and settled in Hollywood where she had a brief film career in films noirs . Gaby introduced Leiber to the works of Thomas Mann, and helped her husband with the lyrics.

<p> The song was inspired by the 1896 story Disillusionment ( Enttuschung ) by Thomas Mann . The narrator in Mann's story tells the same stories of when he was a child. A dramatic adaptation of Mann's story was recorded by Erik Bauserfeld and Bernard Mayes ; it was broadcast on San Francisco radio station KPFA in 1964. [ 4 ]
<p> One difference between the story and the song is that the narrator in Mann's story finally feels free when he sees the sea for the first time and laments for a sea without a horizon. Most of the words used in the song's chorus are taken verbatim from the narrator's words in Mann's story.
<p> An altered version by No Wave singer Cristina was available briefly in 1980. However, it offended songwriters Leiber and Stoller, who sued and were able to get it suppressed for some time. Produced by August Darnell , a.k.a. Kid Creole, this version was eventually re-issued in 2004 as a bonus track on a Cristina compilation.
