<h> Is It Scary? Lyrics - Michael Jackson
<p> There's a ghost out in the hall Theirs a goul beneath the bed Now it's coming through the walls Now it's coming down the stairs
<p> Then there's screaming in the dark Hear the beating of his heart Can you feel it in the air Ghosts be hiding everywhere
<p> I'm gonna be Exactly what you wanna see It's you whose haunting me Your warning me To be the stranger In your life
<p> Am I amusing you Or just confusing you Am I the beast You visualised And if you wanna to see Eccentrialities I'll be grotesque Before your eyes
<p> Let them all materialise
<p> Is that scary for you baby Am I scary for you oh Is it scary for you baby Is it scary for you
<p> You know the stranger is you Is it scary for you baby
<p> There's a creak beneath the floor There's a creak behind the door There's a rocking in the chair But nobody sitting there Their's a ghostly smell around But nobody to be found And a coughin' and a yawnin' Where restless soul's spoke
<p> I'm gonna be Exactly what you gonna see So did you come to me To see your fantasies Performed before your very eyes
<p> A haunting ghostly treat The foolish trickery And spirits dancing In the light
<p> But if you came to see The truth the purity It's here inside A lonely heart
<p> So let the performance start
<p> Is that scary for you baby Am I scary for you oh Am I scary for you baby Am I scary for you So tell me is it scary for you baby So tell me is it crazy for you baby Am I scary for you
<p> You know the stranger is you Am I scary for ya
<p> Masquerade the heart Is the height of haunting souls Just not what you seek of me Can the heart reveal the proof Like a mirror reveals the truth See the evil one is you
<p> Is that scary for you baby Am I scary for you oh Am I scary for you baby Is it scary for you So tell me am I scary for you baby Am I scary for ya baby Is is scary for ya baby Am I scary for you (I don't wanna talk about it)
<p> Am I scary for you baby Am I scary for you I'm tired of being abused You know you're scaring me too I see the evil is you Is it scary for you baby
<p> Michael was saying that he was tired of everyone villifying him. He was saying that the media wants to turn him into a monster. If that's what you want to see instead of the truth, then that's what you'll believe. Instead, if you look closer, you'll see that he's lonley and innocent. That's what he's saying. It's very, very clear in this long and in the full version of Ghosts.

<p> To the idiot who just posted as 'michael jackson', I hate to tell you this, but you blew it with your attrocious spelling. Michael would know the difference between 'hear' and 'here'. Go back to school. He'd want you to get a good education not sit on the internet wasting your life.
<p> Michael Jackson | Reviewer: Anonymous | 2/11/12
<p> Hello everyone, its me, just like to say i love you all with all my heart, but i have decided that i need a break from my life, rest assured i have not passed away, do not believe what you here in the tabloids, i am here and i love you all. I will be back soon. MJ
<p> genius... | Reviewer: soyoung | 12/28/11
<p> MJ truly was a genius.
<p> Stunning versatility, outrageous originality.
<p> That irony that his stunning commercial success led him to be unfairly regarded by some as nothing more than a product of commercial hype and caused his artistic integrity to be undermined is nothing less than a crime.
<p> Do u know him or did you saw his dead body? NO! Then please dear don't say things that you are not aware of, ok? He explain through his lyrics, films etc why he would do this - dissapear. I don't wanna hurt anybody because I know your reasons - he would never leave his children - but truth is he did not leave his children. He will be back soon, probably at the end of 2012. You'll see all! And you'll know then all the reasons. What I can tell is that it has to do with his main message love, peace, a better world. Again, you will see!
<p> This song. | Reviewer: Rosie | 4/4/11
<p> This song has gotten me through so much. I've never been able to decipher what exactly he was trying to say in this song, but it's an obvious cry for help. This was the first song by Michael to literally pull me in and make my soul dance. I don't know if it's the trashing drums or the riveting guitar, but when I first heard it on Christmas Eve of 09, I fell in love. Something in it makes me instantly feel peaceful and serene. He throws his everything into this song and it shows how great he truly was. I just fall in love with him all over again every time I hear it, and it will always be my favorite.
<p> ANOYMOUS | Reviewer: Anonymous | 1/3/11
<p> someone asked up there was mj alive? no he isnt. mj would never fake his death. its sad that after all the suffering his children, family, and close friends went through people are still making dumb judgements. people just need to just stop making lies cause he has died and people wont leave him alone. they even had a funeral where his daughter made a heartbreaking speech and in the oprah interview the kids talked about their favorite memories. and think bout it. WHO ON EARTH WOULD FAKE THEIR DEATH IF THEY HAD CHILDREN?? SO NOOOOOO HE ISNT.
<p> divinity in motion | Reviewer: bob | 11/22/10
<p> i love michael...but does he make up alot of words?! Eccentrialities? what does it mean? disrespectable?! (tabloid junkie)though to be fair you can kind of infer the meaning of that one.
<p> love the lyrics though...some of his best ... to me its about seeing as a child does
<p> esp. love the lyric 'i'm gonna be exactly what you wanna see' because it encapsulates all that it means to be predjudiced...and not see like a child
<p> 'absolute greatness' your right that skeleton dancing looks incredible, its 'divinity in motion'

<p> Is It scary | Reviewer: Keisha | 5/28/10
<p> I;m ashamed that I just came to realise the existence of this song.Since my frist time listening to it, I cant stop it!! I love this song very much and the lyrics are clear enough!! Who is scary? Michael Jackson or the media? Look within your heart, then ask.. I've never seen someone who been vilified/crucified so much in a life. I felt his pain and I love you more,Michael
<p> Amazing.... | Reviewer: Midna | 4/26/10
<p> I absoloutly LOVE this song, but thats no suprise, every michael jackson song was truly inspiring, and he really made his mark as the king of pop. I believe that he is one of the amzing people that humans worldwide will remember for the rest of their lives. He really made a change in music...and he was always so interested in love, and peace, and he even said that he wrote certain songs to make a sense of awareness in people. To make a change. I think that he was an amazing musician, and an amazing person.
<p> "In a world filled with hate, we must still dare to hope. In a world filled with anger, we must still dare to comfort. In a world filled with despair, we must still dare to dream. And in a world filled with distrust, we must still dare to believe." -Michael Jackson 1958-2009
<p> This is genious. For some reason, almost all of his songs sound like I've heard them before his death, including this one. The music is so strong, and his voice, when it's dark it sounds like he's a monster, but when it lightens up, you see some light. This song is a message to the peoples: Don't judge people by their appearance, and don't lie.
<p> michael jackson has are big genius about a music,video clips,consert perform,all of him is perfect.his voice is truly he is know make are people tell him the king of pop.he can make amazing dance with never entertainer make like him.by the way,true legend of lonely world.

<p> The press... | Reviewer: Moudy | 12/25/09
<p> Michael really was a genius! He did everything things to help and to heal the world. And then he's singing about himself begging for some help and nobody's listening. We shouldn't hate ourselves, but we should at least apollogize - it doesn't matter how, but we have to! And all the stuff the press is writing about and all these horrible lies everybody's still believing in... Now he's gone and they just don't stop writing fantasystories about him and just like always: Everybody believes what the press says! How blind people can be! You know, I'm from germany and I am 13 now and since I'm 8 I'm not believing in the press and so on... I don't know if you heared about it too, but in the german newspapers they say, that Michael isn't dead and that they saw him on the backseat of Tito's van! They say he's still alive! Michael is allowed to die, okay? He's human too! He is an angel, but he isn't any creature which's not able not die.
<p> (I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense what I am writing.)
<p> Michael went through hell since he was very little. The money, his father, then the press and the paparazzi started haunting him... ! Oh my god! Can't you just leave him alone?!? I'm so sorry, Michael! I don't know how people can do things like these! I love you so much! And I promise: We'll try to heal the world TOGETHER!
