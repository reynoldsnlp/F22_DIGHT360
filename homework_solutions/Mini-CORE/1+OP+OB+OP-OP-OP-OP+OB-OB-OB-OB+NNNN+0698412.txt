<h> 10 things we want to see in the new season of Doctor Who
<p> With Doctor Who season 6 just over a week away Robbie lists 10 things he'd like to see over the coming episodes...
<p> The new season of Doctor Who is almost upon us, bringing with it the promise of "all of time and space; everywhere and anywhere; every star that ever was", in the words of the Eleventh Doctor.
<p> That's a fine promise. Here's a wishlist of ten more things I'd love to see in the next thirteen episodes...
<p> Less Earth
<p> The Doctor has a special connection with Earth, even going so far as to declare himself its protector, but surely there can't be too many more time periods or famous historical figures left to meddle with?
<p> For me, setting the action on an alien planet gives Doctor Who 's writers the freedom to do whatever they like, and makes it harder for the audience to predict what will happen next.
<p> More TARDIS
<p> We're told the TARDIS is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside, filled with countless rooms and strange alien goodness. But we never see beyond the control room.
<p> Last season's Amy's Choice tantalisingly promised an episode set on the TARDIS, but failed to deliver the goods. It would be great to see an episode spent entirely on the ship, exploring the weird and wonderful world of the TARDIS' interior.
<p> Less sonic screwdriver
<p> The sonic screwdriver is meant to speed the Doctor through simple obstacles and keep the narrative cracking along, not be used to do everything , all the time.
<p> Going 'hands-free' more often encourages interesting approaches to problem solving that challenge the Doctor's abilities and keep the audience interested. Simply using the sonic to open the Pandorica (no matter how much of the universe had just exploded) detracted from the finale, especially if you'd already imagined the Doctor methodically unlocking thousands of traps, one at a time over the course of hundreds of years.
<p> More new villains (and please, no Daleks!)
<p> Out with the old, in with the new! New villains introduce an unknown quantity that pushes the Doctor to his limits and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.
<p> On the other hand, some of the classic villains (Daleks and Cybermen, in particular) have worn out their welcome by appearing in virtually every season of the new series.
<p> As the saying goes, "familiarity breeds contempt." Even the scariest monster in creation won't stay that way if you keep inviting it over for Sunday dinner.
<p> Up the fear factor
<p> Doctor Who should be watched from behind the sofa. It's at its best when it sends shivers down our spine, making us peer into the shadows for what might be hiding there.
<p> Although well written, many of the episodes from Moffat's  season 1, especially  two-parters such as The Hungry Earth / Cold Blood , had some scary moments, but ultimately couldn't sustain the tension.
<p> Get the audience's hearts racing and you guarantee they'll come back for more.
<p> Doctor development
<p> Whilst the Russell T Davies years certainly had some negatives, one of the things Davies did fantastically well was show a clear character progression for each Doctor.
<p> Eccleston's Nine was furious when we met him, while Tennant's Ten was tired, lonely and didn't give second chances. But both mellowed somewhat because of their time with Rose and other companions.
<p> Matt Smith's Eleven has a hugely entertaining, distinct personality already, which will, hopefully, become even more layered in the coming season.
<p> More mythology
<p> Previous seasons have developed Doctor Who 's mythology with references to the Doctor's off screen past, his name, the Time War and becoming the "last of the Time Lords", for example. Any additional development of these themes is always guaranteed to pique our curiosity.
<p> Bring back Jack
<p> The thought of Captain Jack and the Eleventh Doctor teaming up should be enough to make any genuine Who fan giggle with glee imagining the fun to be had, with Jack's sauciness going straight over the top of Eleven's head.
<p> Please don't kill Amy and Rory. Please.
<p> No companion in the new series has lasted longer than two seasons. This doesn't bode well for Amy and Rory, particularly given they've both died and been resurrected once already last season.
<p> They're both great characters,  and together with the Doctor, the three actors clearly have a lot of chemistry. Give them plenty of time to grow into the legendary companions they have the potential to be.
<p> A nemesis
<p> The most disappointing aspect for some of last season's Doctor Who was its failure to reveal the nemesis behind the 'silence' and the destruction of the TARDIS (although, countering that, it's great to have longer-running storylines).
<p> While Moffatt undoubtedly plans to reveal this in good time, it left the finale a little flat and made the Doctor's 'victory' somewhat hollow, as he defeated a situation rather than an antagonist.
<p> Four seasons of big finales featuring confrontations between the Doctor and some of his greatest enemies have given the audience an expectation that every finale will have an equally momentous face-off. Hopefully, the new season can deliver just that.
