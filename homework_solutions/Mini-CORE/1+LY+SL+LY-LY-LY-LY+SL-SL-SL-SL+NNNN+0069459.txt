<p> If you want fire, then we better start smoking If you want water, then we better start crying If you want ice, then we better start drinking If you want tears, then we better start dying I guess you're proud to be different
<p> If you want sleep, then we better start dreaming If you want war, then we better start fighting If you want lies, then we better start confessing If you want forgiveness, you better start apologizing I guess you're proud to be different
<p> If you want the truth, then we better start lying If you wanna feel, then we better start touching If you want air, then we better start breathing If you wanna die, then we better start living I guess you're proud to be different
