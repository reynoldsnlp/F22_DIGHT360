<h> On the Ground: Mildura remembers one year on from the floods
<p> By ABC Open Sunraysia, Lara van Raay
<p> It's been one year since the flash flooding event that saw many properties and businesses around Mildura go underwater. A new exhibition at the LEAP gallery takes a look back at what it was like for the people on the ground.
<p> Entitled Cloudburst , the exhibition is a result of a collaboration between Mildura's Flood Recovery Committee and the LEAP project space, which is curated by Jill Antonie.
<p> Over 100 people came from all over the region to attend the launch of the show, which coincided with the Febraruary 4 anniversary of the initial downpour and features photos and video of Sunraysia under water.
<p> "Everyone involved believed it was important to mark the event", says Ms Antonie.
<p> "Although we are twelve months on, many are still living with it on a daily basis; the impact and recovery is still a big part of many people's lives."
<p> Part of the exhibition allows the audience to listen to soundscapes recreating the experiences of children from flood-affected families - put together during workshops held over summer.
<p> The many photos collected show the scale and depth of the flooding and also offer glimpses into the lighter side of the time, with photos of people fishing and boating along their once dry roads.
<p> The exhibit also gives prominence to three film segments: vox pops with the general public; conversations with affected residents about how they have recovered from the event - reminiscent of the ABC Open project, Aftermath ; and the above video, featuring interviews with some of the key crews behind the disaster and recovery effort, from the State Emergency Service's Michael Hellwege to Council engineers and Victoria Police.
<p> Created by Jill Antonie and Robert Klarich, the film highlights the ways in which those who offer support to a community in need often cannot escape taking on some of the pain and suffering as well.
<p> Ms Antonie says those behind the show thought it would create an opportunity to bring the community together and highlight the resilience of those affected by the flash flooding.
<p> "We really wanted to send a message to those people that they had not been forgotten", says Ms Antonie.
<p> "We also recognised that this was a significant event in the history of Sunraysia and as such should be recorded in a way that was both respectful and reflective."
<p> Cloudburst can be viewed Tuesday to Friday, between 11am and 3 pm at the LEAP project space in Langtree Avenue, Mildura and closes March 3.
