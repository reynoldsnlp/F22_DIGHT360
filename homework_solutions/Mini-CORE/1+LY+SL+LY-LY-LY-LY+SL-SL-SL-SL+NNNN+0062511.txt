<h> Sweeney Todd - The Barber And His Wife lyrics
<p> The Barber And His Wife lyrics by Sweeney Todd There was a barber and his wife, And she was beautiful. A foolish barber and his wife. She was his reason and his life, And she was beautiful, And she was virtuous, And he was... naive. There was another man who saw That she was beautiful. A pious vulture of the law, Who, with a gesture of his claw, Removed the barber from his plate, Sweeney Todd The Barber And His Wife lyrics found on http://www.lyricsoncall.com/lyrics/sween\\...

I doubt if anyone would know... [dialogue] There's a hole in the world like a great black pit And it's filled with people who are filled with shit And the vermin of the world inhabit it...
