<p> I will meet you in the morning on the bright riverside, When all sorrows have drifted away. I'll be standing at the portal with the gates open wide At the close of life's long, dreary day.
<p> Cho: I'll meet you in the morning with a "How do you do?" And we'll sit down by the river, and with rapture, old acquaintance renew. You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear. When I meet you in the morning in that city that is built foursquare.
<p> I will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by, And exchange the old cross for a crown. There will be no disappointments and no body shall die In that land where life's sun goeth down.
<p> I will meet you in the morning at the end of the way On the streets of that city of gold, Where we all can be together and be happy for aye As the years of eternity roll.
