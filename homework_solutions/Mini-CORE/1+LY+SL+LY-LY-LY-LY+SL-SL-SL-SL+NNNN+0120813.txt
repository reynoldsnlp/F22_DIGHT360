<h> I Don't Want To Know Lyrics - Mario Winans
<p> intro:I just can't believe this man, This is enough of this thought, Can't get this out of my head,
<p> Somebody said they saw you The person you were kissing wasn't me And I would never ask you I just kept it to myself
<p> [chorus] I don't wanna know If you're playing me Keep it on the low Cuz my heart cant take it anymore And if you're creeping Please don't let it show Oooh baby, I don't want to know
<p> oooh baby
<p> (verse2) I think about it when I hold you When looking in your eyes I can't believe I don't need to know the truth Baby, keep it to yourself
<p> [chorus] I don't wanna know If you're playing me Keep it on the low Cuz my heart cant take it anymore And if you're creeping Please don't let it show Oooh baby, I don't want to know
<p> (Background)/Bridge Does he touch you better than me(Touch you better than me) Does he watch you fall asleep (watch you fall asleep) Does he show you love this way and the things you do to me (do to me baby) if you're better off that way (better off that way) baby all that I can say (all that I can say) Go on and do your thing and don't come back to me (Stay away from me Baby)
<p> &lt;P.Diddy&gt; I don't wanna know where your Whereabouts or how you movin I know when you in the house or When you cruising It's been proving My love you abusing I cant understand how a man Got you choosin Undecided I came and provided ma, My undivided You came and denied it(why) Don't even try it, I know when you lying Don't even do that I know why you crying (stop cryin) Im not applying no pressure, I Just want to let you know That I don't want to let you go And I don't want to let you leave Cant say I didn't let you breath Gave you extra cheese(c'mon)Put you in the SUV You wanted ice So I made you freeze Made you hot Like the West Indies Now it's time you invest in me Cuz if not then its best you leave holla yeah
<p> I don't wanna know If you're playing me Keep it on the low Cuz my heart cant take it anymore And if you're creeping Please don't let it show Oooh baby, I don't want to know [x2]
