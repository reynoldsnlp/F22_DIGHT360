<h> Interview: Clark
<p> Clark's freshly released record Iradelphic is blindingly good. Jack Midalia caught up with Clark ahead of his show at The Bakery on Friday, April 27 (tickets here ), and spoke to him about the making of the record, his live show, intolerant neighbours, and his feelings towards the term "IDM".
<p> Where are you at the moment? I'm in Berlin, just in the studio.
<p> This is where you are living at the moment? In between gigs, yeah?
<p> Your new record was made in a lot of different places. Was that the plan or was that just what happened? That was never the plan at all, but I kind of ended up turning it my way and finding ways to work in these different places and using quite a lot of different acoustic space. There was a really good flat that I stayed in Brussels that had this amazing stone hallway that I used for quite a lot of the reverb and echo and space on the album.
<p> It was nice to get away from the studio where I'm fairly spoiled with tools -- I've got almost too much gear and I think that's always a bit of a sticky situation. It's good to strip it back and just work on the most important thing which is structuring tracks and finishing ideas rather than just kind of wanking off machinery.
<p> The record certainly sounds that way -- it sounds very natural in the way it's constructed. There's definitely that kind of that... when I hear purely digital music there's that kind of in-the-box quality that just sounds slightly plastic and hemmed in in the way that a microwave dinner is hemmed in. It's nice to let stuff breathe a bit outside that.
<p> There's a huge array of different sounds on the record. I saw a list of different sound sources you used on the record and it was crazy. How did you go about putting all this together? It's a really long editing process. There were so many hours worth of jams -- loads of stuff that people will never hear, and I'm really glad they'll never hear because there's lots of false starts. It was just chiselled down from this wide range of stuff.
<p> For "The Pining", the first mix I did of it was around the time of Turning Dragon where I was playing a lot of guitar and producing drums that were just completely inappropriate -- just kind of electronic. So it took a long time to find the right textures that fitted all of that work. It was really satisfying when I did finally manage to make it all fall into place.
<p> I've got a drum kit in my cellar and used that for a few tracks. I had some recording sessions in studios that went quite badly... I always find I'm better recording myself rather than having an engineer -- something about being relaxed, and the flaws in my recording technique ended up working for the record, it feels more personal. Plus I've got this weird reverb in my cellar because there are pipes going all round it and the drums kind of clang off the pipes. It's a cellar that I share with the rest of the tenants.
<p> And they don't seem to mind you doing that? They do actually... they really mind. They're fucking... they're incredibly annoying. Yeah, they do mind. But I mind being able to record music as well, so it's kind of balanced.
<p> I read a really interesting quote from you in an interview where you were talking about the idea of IDM. I think the quote was that a lot of "intelligent" dance music was actually "clever" dance music. I was wondering if you could expand on that a bit. I'm glad you brought that up, because most people just say to me "so, you write IDM... how's your IDM album?" and it's like "what, my IDM album that starts with a guitar track and has got Martina Topley-Bird and solo piano tracks and not a single techno beat on the whole album? Do you mean that IDM album?"
<p> I don't really know what IDM is and it's an incredibly snooty, elitist... it just seems like this elitist fraternity of male dysfunctional opinion that just sort of floats around suddenly becomes part of musical history. I feel like it's not an appropriate part of musical history and I've never felt that I've been an IDM artist. I don't really feel like an electronic artist -- I just feel like a craftsman that makes music with whatever he can, and when people put the tag "intelligent" on it, I feel like it's kind of sneering at all the people who enjoy music that doesn't wear its cleverness on its sleeve, and for that alone it should be mocked.
<p> It kind of defines itself by what it isn't, which I always think is a bit suspect. Exactly, that's it. And also, there's some music that's electronic that's incredibly technical but it's not just that it's technical it's that the technique is on the sleeve of the music. I much prefer music where the technique is invisible and you're not paying attention to how accomplished this person is at a particular skill. That's never something I'm rewarded from in music -- I never listen to something that moves me and think "wow, this person is really accomplished at this skill, what a fine athlete". That's not what I look for -- if I wanted that I'd watch the Olympics with a passion like no-one else.
<p> There was a weird backlash with this Daft Punk reference I made, where there's this one amazing Daft Punk track and I think people were like, "God, he likes Daft Punk, their music's like, so stupid". But the fact is that Daft Punk were accomplished technicians like no other really and the technique is kind of behind the music. I'm by no means a massive Daft Punk fan, but when they nail it, there's no sense of this being "stupid music" at all.
<p> Can you tell me briefly about your live show... I've heard it's quite the experience. It's been really hard preparing for it, because the album is quite different to the live show and there's a massive potential for it to go wrong because I'm taking quite a lot of modular gear and analogue gear on stage. So it's a lot more improvised than shows I've had before. The textures of the album are kind of integrated into the show, but there's no guitar or singing because I don't think that would really work with a more dance-floor orientated set.
