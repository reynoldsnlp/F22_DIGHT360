<p> We are proud to say that our entire range of Limited Edition art and artwares are all made in England. We produce many of the items in house at our factory in York. With our ceramics being produced in Stoke-on-Trent, our Luggage in the South West and new furniture in the North East. We use the finest components and manufacturers.
<p> We ship Worldwide with FedEx.
<p> We ship all art and artware Internationally using FedEx - this means that your prints, cushions or even an eyemask is fully tracked until it arrives at it's destination. It also means that when it leaves us it just takes a couple of days Worldwide. But please remember we print all our art prints and canvas prints on demand to your specification - that takes around 10-12 working days - but if FedEx ship there so do we!
<p> HahnemAhle Paper & Canvas used on ALL our Limited Edition Prints.
<p> We are now using Hahnemhle paper and canvas for all our limited edition prints. Widely regarded as the World's best paper we use Photorag 308gsm as standard for all our paper prints and 400gsm Hahnemhle Daguerre Fine Art Canvas for our printed boxed canvas. As a result our Art prints are better than ever - colours are even richer and deeper with even more precision and detail. All our prints are a flat matt finish - looking as close to Original Art as possible. All items are manufactured and lovingly hand finished in the UK.
<p> New limited edition art print sizes.
<p> Due to demand we have increased the size options of our Limited Edition art prints and printed canvases. We have added a huge A0 841mm x 1189mm paper print at 139 and also an A4 Contemporary Framed print - this has an external frame size of 330 x 417mm / 13" x 16.5?_.

<p> Grand Designs LIVE - October 2012
<p> We are very pleased to announce that we will be exhibiting at the forthcoming Grand Designs Live at Birmingham NEC, from October 12th to the 14th 2012. We will be in the Design Arcade Stand E1.
<p> New stockists.
<p> We are very pleased to welcome Liberty of London as a retailer of our ceramics. Liberty is one of the last great emporiums for innovative and eclectic design. Situated in the heart of London since 1875, it remains to this day the destination of choice for the savvy and sophisticated shopper. We are very proud to have our artist's work sold there.
<p> We are pleased to announce the launch of two new pillow editions from American artist Sylvia Ji. Blue Drift and La Catrina are sure to be just as popular as her other recent editions. Plus watch this space for another beautiful pair of editions from one of our most popular artists.
<p> Numbered Certificates of Authenticity with twinned hologram.
<p> To guarantee that all our limited edition art prints and canvases are part of a 250 edition, we are now shipping each with a Certificate of Authenticity that is not only numbered but also features a hologram that is twinned with a hologram on the back of the print. Each hologram is also numbered and tamperproof.
<p> We are very pleased to welcome two of America's best loved artists, Brandt Peters and Kathy Olivas. Two independent artists who also work together to great effect. We have wanted to work with Kathy and Brandt for many years so we are particularly excited to see their collection of editions with us unfold.
<p> From the land of surf and sea, Caia Koopman has emerged as one of lowbrow's preeminent female artists. With a well-rounded background from her years spent obtaining her BA in Fine arts from UC Santa Cruz, to her time spent in the skateboarding and snowboarding scenes, Caia's environment has both molded and provided an eclectic background that makes her paintings come to life. With her fine detail for beauty, inclinations toward nature, and collectiveness of the female spirit, Caia has quickly become one of the quintessential artists fully encompassing the elegance, strengths, and vulnerabilities of femininity. We look forward to more from Caia later this year too.
