<h> I Think You Think Too Much Lyrics - Against All Authority
<p> Don't know I'm watching you and every move you make I know what you do and everything you say I hear loud and clear and there wont be no escape For those of you who won't cooperate So don't stand in our way, obey Or you'll be taken away and you will soon be forgotten mind and body rottin' and you'll pay for what you do and say I think you think too much- you think too much We're watching you And everything you do and say will come back some day Just look at this fucking mess you made Choose carefully the words you wish to speak Confiscated my zines and my lyric sheets Detained 8 hours, It was looking bleak They called the dogs, they called us thieves We stood and watched in disbelief They stripped our van to the cold concrete We pulled away to their defeat We made it to the show and didn't miss a beat So sign that line the lies that I create Will follow you and its unfortunate You opened your mouth and your words agitate And freedom of speech we will not tolerate
