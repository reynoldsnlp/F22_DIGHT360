<h> On Top Of The World Lyrics
<p> You're on top of the world On top of the world and you can't Get any higher-you're on top of the world You're on top of the world tonight It wasn't easy- it was hard as hell You didn't get luck in a wishin' well Never worked so hard- had so much pain Wouldn't change for anything Learned love from a movie screen He was tough, she was wild at fifteen Quit school and had no dreams Wasn't going very far Then he got religion and she got a god It's on her back and it's in his job And it costs lots of money, honey- oh, no Breakdown nearly every day Shoulda known- couldn't get away Got lucky with the girl next door She was lonely and didn't care She was young, she was dark, she was fair Wrapped herself around you with her stare You'd explode if she would touch you there Touch you there- touch you there Tonight, tonight-tonight-tonight You're on top of the world On top of the world and you can't Get any higher You're on top of the world You're on top of the world tonight (can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight (can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight (can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight (can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cheap+trick\\... ]
