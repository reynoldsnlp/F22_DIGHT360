<h> Treat others as you would like to be treated
<p> I love that section in topical news magazines -- the 'ministry of the bleeding obvious' one. The section which reports research as news, research which took years to undertake, serious money to carry out, and the outcome could have been predicted by a passing nine year old.
<p> This weeks research that shows happy patients come from practices that look after them well, or was it that practices which look after their patients well have happy patients?
<p> In any event the conclusion was that good service produces happy customers, or was it that happy customers are easy to please?
<p> Anyhow, whatever the conclusion was, it kind of seemed obvious.
<p> What does it mean in the real world? That's probably a PhD in its own right, but from the Custodes perspective it seems that we need to get smarter about making patients happier. I'm not suggesting handing out sick notes and antibiotics on demand, but simply that we expend a little effort in thinking 'does my surgery look after me like I'd want to be looked after?' Let's try being a patient, or at least taking their view, visit a friends practice, sit in their waiting room, look through their safety glass, gaze at their posters, feel their chairs dig into your shoulder blades and ask yourself the question 'does this feel like the 21st century?".
<p> Go and sit in specsavers, the vets or the local council one stop shop, ask the same question.
<p> Finally walk into your own practice, use the patient entrance, do it when there is no one there.
<p> Be honest, is it the best place you visited? If it isn't then ask why you don't treat people better.
<p> Also try a) sitting on your patient's chair in your surgery, lower smaller firmer and intimidatingly inferior to the GP's armchair; hopefully the patients chair's two front legs are no shorter than the back two to avoid involuntary movement towards the surgery door. b) Try lying on your examination room couch -- small room, high and narrow couch, no pillow these days, awkward angle backrest as standard,cold surface and evidently uncomfortable and that's before considering the state of undress, the intrusive examination while the doctor says Hmmm in a concerned tone, the venepuncture et al. I did find that a 'Smiley' or cartoon character on the ceiling no disadvantage particularly when examining children.
