<h> Biography
<p> Manchester became the center of the mid-90s Britpop movement thanks to the incredible success of Oasis. Their first two albums, Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory? , were multi-million sellers that made the swaggering Gallagher brothers the biggest rock stars in the land.
<p> Hopefully a day will come when Oasis compiles all of their great B-sides and covers on a two-disc set (maybe even three). Until then, fans would be well advised to track down this single, as no Oasis collection is complete without the unreleased tracks "Stay Young," a great original, and "Heroes," a fantastic, jangling cover of the David Bowie classic. If you dig Oasis, trust me, you won't regret it. Great stuff.
<p> D'You Know What I Mean is the first single off the Oasis album Be Here Now. It's a great single with some great and rare Oasis songs.
<p> D'You know what I mean is a decent song. It's one of the songs you can tell Noel was definetly thinking about the Beatles when he wrote it. I like the beat to the song and the guitars are great in it.
<p> Stay Young is a great rebelion song. I was glad they put it on The Masterplan album because this song is a gem. " Hey Stay Young Invincible." I played this song over and over the first time I heard it. Teenagers really can relate to this song.
<p> Angel Demo is an ok song. I can see why the band has never done anything with it, but it's still some great songwriting from Noel. This is the only place to find this song at.
<p> Finally we have a cover of Heros. Nobody does a cover quite like Oasis does. They always sound great and they never insult the original. All the guys are big fans of Bowie and this song is a nice tribute to him. It's an awesome song already and Oasis does a great cover. This is the only place to get this song from.
<p> This is a grea Oasis single. It has two songs that are only available on it, so harcore fans really should pick this one up.
<p> What I loved about buying an Oasis single import CD back in the '90s was that there were two or three other songs which were usually great tracks! Unfortunately, I never got to buy this particular one, which includes a very rare studio version of David Bowie's "Heroes" which I feel is the best version I've heard of that tune. In fact, that cover is essentially why I finally ended up buying this CD. "Stay Young"(which also appears on The Masterplan b-sides album), "Angel Child", along with the title track round out a rare goodie from the golden years of a great band.
