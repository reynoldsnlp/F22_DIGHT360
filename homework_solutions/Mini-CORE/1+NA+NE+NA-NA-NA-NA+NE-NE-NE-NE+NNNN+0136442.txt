<h> POLITICO LIVE: Congress comes back to full plate
<p> In the wake of Barack Obama's reelection win and ahead of a possible 2016 White House bid of his own, the Kentucky Republican plans to mix his hard-line tea party conservatism with more moderate policies that could woo younger voters and minorities largely absent from the GOP coalition. It's the latest tactic of the freshman senator to inject the Libertarian-minded views shared by his retiring father into mainstream Republican thinking as the party grapples with its future.
<p> In an interview with POLITICO, Paul said he'll return to Congress this week pushing measures long avoided by his party. He wants to work with liberal Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and Republicans to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for pot possession. He wants to carve a compromise immigration plan with an "eventual path" to citizenship for illegal immigrants, a proposal he believes could be palatable to conservatives. And he believes his ideas -- along with pushing for less U.S. military intervention in conflicts overseas -- could help the GOP broaden its tent and appeal to crucial voting blocs that handed Democrats big wins in the West Coast, the Northeast and along the Great Lakes.
<p> "We have three big regions where we're not competitive," Paul said. "And we have to be competitive in those regions."
<p> Paul, 49, was elected on the tea party wave that fueled GOP landslide victories in 2010, often declaring on the campaign trail that he had a "message" from the tea party: "We have come to take our government back."
<p> But two years later, the tea party agenda has stalled in Congress, and House Republicans who ran on that purity platform in 2010 began to tout bipartisan compromises with Democrats in 2012. Nationally, the GOP recognizes it has a demographic problem from New England to the Southwest it needs to correct ahead of the 2014 midterm elections and the next White House race in 2016.
<p> Paul hasn't given up on the tea party agenda; he plans to lead what he says is a national movement to help usher through a constitutional amendment limiting House members and senators to 12 years of service to "throw some of the bums out just for length of service."
<p> But after his first two years in elected office, few, if any of Paul's goals on his 2010 tea party platform have gone anywhere. He wanted to force lawmakers to wait one day for every 20 pages of a bill before a vote can occur -- that never saw the light of day. He wanted to make sure every bill explicitly lays out its constitutional authority -- that proposal is gathering dust. Often, he finds himself on the losing end of his own party -- most notably on his recent push to slash foreign aid that failed resoundingly 10-81 over fears it would have weakened national security.
<p> Now, Paul appears to want a more influential role in his party than simply the bomb-throwing back-bencher with a penchant for grabbing headlines. Unlike his father, retiring Texas Rep. Ron Paul , who toiled on the GOP fringes for years and battled with the party establishment, the younger Paul seems to have developed political savvy in dealing with GOP leaders.
<p> Paul said it "wouldn't hurt" for his party to take a softer stand on the issue, saying it would show that the GOP is a "little bit rational" and "reasonable" if penalties for pot possession were weakened. (Politico)
<p> You want to know how dire are the straits the Republican Party is in? Rand Paul -- Rand Paul, we're talking about -- is trying to lead them into being a "little bit rational and reasonable." He's claiming it won't hurt his party to be at least a "little bit" rational and reasonable.
<p> I fully support his efforts to federally lessen some possession penalties for marijuana users, but overall I just hope we can get through his six years without this nut doing more damage than he's already done. Kentucky made a big mistake in sending this strange ophthalmologist to Washington, D.C. Though they can't undo their damage, hopefully the voters of Kentucky will repent and next time around send someone else. Send someone else for McConnell too. Don't Kentuckians have any thoroughbreds to send us in D.C.?
<p> If a stranger knocks on your front door, do you have to let him in your house. What if he says he's hungry, do you have to feed him? What if he's tired and has no place to sleep? Do you get him a blanket and show him to the guest room? I'm guessing "no" to all of these. If you own a restaurant, it's no different than owning your home. At home, you decide who enters your house, and you don't have to explain yourself to any one. Why is it different with your restaurant? Please explain. Remember, there's a public sidewalk in front of my house and I have electricity and a flushing toiltet. Do I have to open doors to anyone that wishes to enter my house?
<p> It's real simple. Look up which states get the most money back from the federal government for each dollar paid in. Blue states like NJ get something like 60 cents for every dollar they send in, while red states like Alaska (those rugged individualists) get $1.87 back. This makes them moochers, leeches, etc.
<p> Rand Paul is a hypocrite. He wants the govern to tell women what they can and can't do with their own bodies. Paul signed the person hood bill which says a fertilized cell is a human. This will make the birth control pill, morning after pill, IUD, Diaphragm and other forms of birth control illegal.
<p> Why hasn't Paul demanded the govern tell all men they must give one of their kidneys to those on waiting lists who will die without one? Oh Paul only likes telling women what they must do with their bodies. Hypocrite. Look life sucks and good people die and the govern should not tell women or men what to do with their bodies. These are private issues.
<p> It's real simple. Look up which states get the most money back from the federal government for each dollar paid in. Blue states like NJ get something like 60 cents for every dollar they send in, while red states like Alaska (those rugged individualists) get $1.87 back. This makes them moochers, leeches, etc.
<p> For starters, states don't send a single dime to the federal government, the individuals living in them do. I live in California. My federal taxes won't change if I move across the border to Arizona.
<p> Like I said to BamaDon, break it down for me. I wasn't aware that the federal government collected all those taxes and then just cut 50 checks (in various amounts) to the several states. What are these federal dollars being spent on?
<p> Shalalee. A business is not like your home. To have a business you have to go through government agencies to make sure it is a safe environment for your customers. If you have a restaurant there are entities to make sure you are following food safety rules etc. If you have a garage there are safety measures that are monitored for the disposal of waste products.
<p> I realize being Libertarian you would like to see these agencies disappear----until you get botulism and die because somewhere you ate wasn't regulated. Or maybe you might one day live in a small town where the nearest pharmacy outside of that town is fifty miles away like some places in the midwest. Maybe the owner of the only pharmacy or a private hospital in town decides to ban all brown haired people from their business----And you need vital medicine or emergency service and you don't have a car. I wonder if you might complain of the unfairness of it all. Guess what?----there was a time when African Americans died because hospitals closest to them would not let them in. People were treated like dirt because of their religion, race, sexual orientation, etc. and denied entry into places of business because of ignorance.
<p> In a humane and educated society the question that you asked is a bit appalling. But again, I find the people who ask these questions tend to be people who have never been discriminated against.
<p> Aside from the ultimate fact that there are LAWS in place that say businesses cannot discriminate I wonder at the hard headedness of your comment. Maybe I am wrong--but I don't believe that you personally can be an ethnic minority, a religious minority or a physically challenged individual or anyone who has come up against rampant bigotry and exclusion. Its almost as if you didn't understand what the Civil Rights movement ever stood for.
<p> Rand Paul can forget about the Presidency right now ! ... Remember, he opposes the Civil Rights Act, saying "private business owners should have a right to refuse certain people into their establishments."
<p> And we all know, that those "CERTAIN PEOPLE" could be anyone of color, same gender or someone with a child for that matter.
<p> Paul completely forgets that any establishment in America has roads, water lines, gas lines, electric lines that public workers built, and service to bring people into businesses & restaurants that they call "Private," ... And there lies the trouble !
<p> I wouldn't support Rand Paul to run a SOUP KITCHEN for the needy ! Such as the one Paul Ryan invaded up in Youngstown, Ohio a few weeks ago to get a picture taken of him washing "CLEAN PANS" !
<p> As for the questions about your house, the answer is no. This is a matter of private property and is generally not open to the public.
<p> When you start a business, you get a business license, which enters you into an agreement (contract) with your community to provide some service to the community. Your license ensure certain standards are up held and those standards come from the local chamber of commerce which is influenced by local, state, and federal laws. If those standards include provisions that prevent you from discriminating based on certain characteristics, then you should not do so as you are bound by the contract you have entered into freely and of your own accord. As a business person, I am sure you would understand that you have to live up to your end of your contract.
<p> You can always refused to do business with individuals or groups, but be careful on how you refuse. If you wish to be bigoted, so be it, but I would suggest you keep in under wraps while doing business in the United States. Just know, there are consequences, rightfully so, if you get caught. It is easier to simply do business freely and openly and evenly with those that want to do business with you. Besides, serving everyone increases your potential customer pool.
<p> He probably believes that you operate within the laws that exist today, but will actively try to change them in the mean time. It is just like with taxes, most people believe that the tax rates should go up, but they are not paying a single dime more than necessary until they do. Need an example? Warren Buffett.
<p> The Vatican is a hostile nation to the US and uses every means possible to destroy it. The bloc of congress and senate that are Catholic have blocked the securing of the borders for 50 years.
<p> I have a question. Is there a successful Catholic nation in the world? Please name one. The problem with government is not R, and it is not D. The problem is Catholic. The religion that is anti US, and follows the pope instead of the Constitution of the US. There are more Catholic in the Senate than any other single religion. This can be found on a search (senate catholic religion) Roman Catholic - 24 (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans).. WASHINGTON -- Catholic make up about 28% of the members of Congress, "Pro life" (Anti Roe v Wade) votes by Cs is found at (internet search (congress pro-life Catholic)) At 29 percent of 109th Congress, Catholics remain largest faith group. And it is the Catholic that are joining in a bloc to prevent the securing of the S border. It is the Catholic that passed a law which gives free medical care to all illegal aliens. It is the Catholic that are attempting to prevent a womans right to choose. Failure of a hundred nations, and a thousand years is their legacy. Vote the Catholic out of office R and D alike, and the bloc will be gone and the Constitution can be restored
<p> It's real simple. Look up which states get the most money back from the federal government for each dollar paid in. Blue states like NJ get something like 60 cents for every dollar they send in, while red states like Alaska (those rugged individualists) get $1.87 back. This makes them moochers, leeches, etc.

<p> @jerzyjoe - What about the trillions of dollars to shore up NY for the NY based financial crisis?
<p> Would it be, could it be the Red states are also regarded as the bible belt? then if that is possible, then the failure is in religion. I have a question. Is there a successful Catholic nation in the world? Please name one. The Catholic in congress, in their wisdom, made it so that any illegal alien that comes across and spits out a "citizen" gets free medical care. This is no joke. And the Catholic in congress in their wisdom, also are keeping the borders open. And the Catholic in congress are both R and D and have formed a bloc to prevent the US from functioning. Check it out. All true. Failure of a hundred nations, and a thousand years is their legacy. Vote the Catholic out of office, and the bloc will be gone and the Constitution can be restored
<p> It's beyong funny how all the conservatives are baling on their principles since the DEM landslide victory and the realization that they can no longer win with their old mantra. Lets see if it holds true!
<p> I believe it will take all Americans, whether you are a Republican, Democrat, TEA party or liberal, to finally solve our economic challenges. I believe it will take "a village" of people with different talents to start and run new "proudly made in the USA" companies.
<p> Can an idea from a TEA party person build upon a business concept of a Liberal? I believe this answer is a YES! I was at an unemployment support group then I realized, there were enough different talents to start and run new companies. There were those with lots of new ideas (a Liberal) and those who are great with the details (TEA party person). Not to mention there were accountants, sales, IT, HR people, just to name a few. By working together, we may discover huge synergy to create many new jobs.
<p> There ought to be a new APP developed, so where you enter your career or your talents, then it matches you with other talents to make up a team to create new companies. Even if they do not create a new company, at least they may make lasting friends.all
<p> Our answers to our economic challenges can be found no further than the people in that same unemployment line we are in. YES, it will take "a village" of people to finally solve our economic challenges! By us working together will not only solve our unemployment problems, we stand united for the world to see.
