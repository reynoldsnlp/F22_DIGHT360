<p> BURIEN, Wash. -- Deputies say a wanted man started smoking methamphetamine after leading police on a long chase that went through Sea-Tac Airport early Wednesday.
<p> Sgt. Patrick McCurdy said the bizarre incident began about 12:30 a.m. when a deputy spotted a stolen Dodge Charger at a Burien gas station.
<p> When the deputy approached, the driver jumped back in the car and took off with his estranged wife in the passenger seat, leading police on a chase up and down Interstate 5, State Routes 518 and 509 and through the arrivals area at Sea-Tac.
<p> McCurdy said the driver never went faster than about 80 mph and even slowed down when he twice led deputies through the airport pick-up road.
<p> After about 20 minutes of chasing the driver, deputies used a PIT maneuver to force the car to stop.
<p> "Immediately afterwards he apparently pulled out a methamphetamine pipe and started smoking right there in front of everybody," McCurdy said.
<p> The man initially refused to get out of the car but eventually complied after a deputy tried to smash a side window on the Charger.
<p> McCurdy said the Burien man was already wanted for a previous eluding incident. He will be booked into the King County Jail for the outstanding arrest warrant as well as investigation of felony eluding, possesion of a stolen vehicle, drug offenses and violating a court order.
<p> "He's in trouble," McCurdy said. "He knew he had the warrant, and he knew the car was stolen."
<p> The man's wife will likely not face any charges.
<p> "She was screaming the whole time for him to stop," McCurdy said.
<p> The couple was separated and the man had a court order barring him from being with his wife.
<p> "Apparently he just showed up, re-entered her life recently with his fancy new car that turned out to be stolen," McCurdy said. "They went out to dinner tonight and everything was going well, according to her, then we found them at the gas station. Things didn't go well after that."
<p> What does have to lose smoking his meth? I mean after all he paid for it and after he was arrested it would only sit in the evidence room unused and wasted. After driving a stolen car, going on a chase with police, and being with his ex-wife who has a restraining order against him, smoking the meth pipe was the least of his problems.
<p> He was trying to avoid a DUI charge.  By lighting up after driving and before they could give him a field sobriety test, he can argue that he was sober during the chase and only impaired after smoking the pipe.  Won't help him on the other charges but now he has an affirmative defense against DUI.
<p> Root Please I wouldnt give him that much credit for thinking at all...........I would be more inclined to believe that he knew the cops would take and wanted one more high before spending the next several years in jail..........
<p> Oh Honey - let's have a romantic date - dinner, high speed chase, a couple trips thru the airport, and some Meth - doesn't that sound like such a romantic time? Idiot!!! What do expect from a meth head.
<p> Well, she might not be arrested this time but I have a hard time believing that a woman who thinks going out with a man who she has a restraining order against isn't on meth as well. Birds of a feather...
