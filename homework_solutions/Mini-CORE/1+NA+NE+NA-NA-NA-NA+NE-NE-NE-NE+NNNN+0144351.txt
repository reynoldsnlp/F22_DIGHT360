<p> A coroner has recommended several police officers face disciplinary action over the tasering of Brazilian student Roberto Laudisio Curti, who died in Sydney in March.
<p> Delivering her findings into the death of Roberto Laudisio Curti at Glebe Coroner's Court this morning, State Coroner Mary Jerram found the 21-year-old's death to be inconclusive, but condemned the actions of police.
<p> Before his death Curti struggled with 11 officers who fired their tasers up to 14 times and used capsicum spray, handcuffs and a baton.
<p> During an October inquest into the tasering incident, counsel assisting the coroner, Jeremy Gormly SC said Mr Curti suffered significantly in the last moments of his life and police had acted in a "thuggish" manner".
<p> He said the taser use was unnecessary and unjustified once Mr Curti was in handcuffs.
<p> The police involved told the inquest they were trying to restrain him because he kept resisting arrest.
<p> The hearing was told Mr Curti was unarmed but had used a small amount of LSD and had stolen a packet of biscuits from a shop.
<p> Relatives of Mr Curti attended the inquest.
<p> NSW Attorney-General Greg Smith on Wednesday welcomed the coroner's decision to allow a TV news camera to film the conclusion of the inquest.
<p> "The NSW Coroners Court is unlike any jurisdiction in Brazil and I am sure the transparency of the inquest has made it easier for the many millions of people in Mr Curti's home country to follow the proceedings via the media," he said in a statement.

<p> Police brutality common practise!
<p> Ben - from Melb, 2 days ago
<p> Police commonly brutalise young people to satisfy their own justice, at the end of the day they are just people who obviously have no training in self control, they should be setting higher examples of greater police officers than opting for a bigger force of gruntmen. Ive witnessed first hand moorabbin police station officers/sergeant's; spitting, assaulting, unnecessary force, holes in peoples walls, breaking iphone which was my property and other peoples property. There is no real justice against police officers who do the wrong thing because its too hard to take them to court because the corroborate and essential lie! What has the aus come to.....
<p> Agree with the Coroner's findings. Sure no action will be taken. Was no policeman smart enough to query why a supposedly armed man stole just 2 packets of biscuits? Surely if someone were armed, that person would steal much more than that. Special training was not needed to witness the terror in that young man's eyes. Police stated the young man didn't obey orders. Nonsense. Repeatedly tasered, handcuffed, capsicum sprayed, on the ground, outnumbered 11 to 1 and this man had an option?
<p> I commend the coroner on her findings, but doubt if either of the police officers responsible for Roberto's death will ever face justice. The Police Integrity Commission is a farce, a complete nonsense that serves only the police.
