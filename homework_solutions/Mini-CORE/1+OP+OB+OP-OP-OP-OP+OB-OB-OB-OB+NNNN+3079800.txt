<h> Politicians realise that we are right about bio-fuels
<p> In the dash for infinite economic growth our governments threw their weight behind bio-fuels. Peak oil has seen a tripling of the price of crude oil. Couple peak oil with a desire to stem global warming from fossil fuel use, and avoid oil imports from unstable countries, our governments insisted on a percentage of our transport fuels being bio derived.
<p> We told them that bio-fuels are not sustainable. That we could not grow enough feed stock to fulfil even a 5% addition of bio-fuel to our fossil fuel. That we would need to use land from developing countries to grow food for our cars rather than the starving people of the developing world. The result is plain to see. Food shortages and food staples more than doubling in price.
<p> Governments are beginning to see the error of their ways. We can either feed our cars in the west or risk hundreds of millions of starving people heading to the west. It is a case of driving less or driving the starving masses in our direction and destabilising the world.
<h> 3 comments:
<p> I think its really encouraging that the UK government and the European Commission are so readily admitting that they may be wrong with their planned targets for biofuels. Hopefully the targets will be abolished.
