<p> Less than a week after he was elected to the U.S. Senate, Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was candid about the GOP's troubles courting Latino voters.
<p> In an interview with The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza , Cruz opened up about concerns in some of the nation's largest states, headed by Texas.
<p> "If Republicans do not do better in the Hispanic community, in a few short years Republicans will no longer be the majority party in our state," he said.
<p> Cruz added that losing a state like Texas, which carried 38 electoral votes in 2012, would hold national implications.
<p> "If that happens, no Republican will ever again win the White House," he said. "New York and California are for the foreseeable future unalterably Democrat. If Texas turns bright blue, the Electoral College math is simple. We won't be talking about Ohio, we won't be talking about Florida or Virginia, because it won't matter. If Texas is bright blue, you can't get to two-seventy electoral votes. The Republican Party would cease to exist. We would become like the Whig Party."
<p> Cruz' words paralleled those of Mitt Romney adviser Carlos Gutierrez , who said on Sunday that Latinos were "scared of the Republican party." The former Commerce Secretary attributed that fear to the presidential primary process, which he said forces candidates "to say outrageous things."
<p> President Barack Obama was reelected last Tuesday with the help of near-record levels of Latino support. Various polls found the incumbent Democrat securing more than 70 percent of that voting bloc.

<p> The primary process does not "force" anyone to do anything, much less say outrageous things. You and the rest of your party pandered to peoples most base fears and tried to build a coalition based on those fears. You tried to band people together based on a fear of "those people." "Those people are a threat to your money, your jobs, your children, your marriage, your religion." Except "those people" are Read More... just fellow Americans trying to make a life for themselves, pay the bills, deal with the kids and boss, etc.
<p> You tried to turn Americans against Americans with your talk about "Real Americans." You went so far as to try and turn adults against innocent children with your run-away paranoia about immigration. You made women the enemy, ethnic minorities the enemy, religious minorities the enemy, the LGBT community the enemy. The problem is, by doing so, you ironically bound all those diverse groups together along with a few (quite a few) "Real Americans" who rejected your message, and that new group became the majority.  And we won.
<p> It isn't the primary process, or the lack of use of social media, or any of the other number of excuses you guys have come up with for your loss. You lost because your message of division and anger and finger pointing was rejected, soundly, completely, thoroughly.
<p> Like I said "keep it up baggers," because the world can see your sore loser mentality (and I use the term mentality loosely).  We (america and the world) win and the dinosaurs lose.  Go on out the door.

<p> The American voting pool is becoming inundated with foreign nationals who broke our laws by entering the U.S. illegally, then having children who then become American citizens and can turn the tide in our elections. Who's at fault? Our own Government for not revising the 14th amendment to reflect our current situation and the abuse taken of it by people who can break our laws, then be rewarded for it! The truth is birthright citizenship is an enticement that draws illegal's into our Country.
<p> We have shot ourselves in the foot, and now the Republican party especially, has seen what ramifications complacency has caused by not resolving the issue of illegal immigration.
<p> I am not against legal immigration, as my Wife is a naturalized citizen, who paid her dues to become one. But it is going to be our downfall to let foreigners come to America illegally and then anchor themselves with offspring who will one day be eligible to vote; And to what conscience will they obey?

<p> Since when is this Ted Cruz the spokesperson for Texas' Mexican-American citizens;afterall he was elected by white Texans;certainly not Latinos....He does not represent Latino interests.He needs to be sent packing in the next election...

<p> When is the east coast media going to understand that Cubans don't speak for us? Ted Cruz won in Texas with white votes, not Latino votes.
<p> Most Latinos are Mexican (66%) and the next largest group is Puerto Rican (9%), but you will never see any Mexicans or Puerto Ricans on any news shows discussing the Latino vote. I hope the GOP runs Rubio or Cruz and wastes another billion dollars.
<p> It doesn't matter. When the media is discussing the so-called Latino vote, they are for the most part talking about the Mexican-American vote. But you will never see anybody from this group hired to appear on cable TV to discuss the election.

<p> Sounds like the Ron Paul supporters and what is left of the non religious, racist and xenophobic right need to move over to the libertarian party and make the libertarian party a bit less extreme libertarian and that will be the new center right party. What's left of Republican party can slowly vanish but for awhile we will actually have a 3 party system. I'll stay a democrat moderate but might occasionally consider a moderate libertarian as the will be liberal on social issues.

<p> Texas,California,New York all Blue? Republican party ceases to exist;actually,only in it's present regressive form. I can envision a more inclusive,literate,"un-Foxed" membership with real statesmen in office.

<p> resistivity: Texas,California,New York all Blue? Republican party ceases to exist;actually,only in
<p> Very true. The Republican party needs to be slightly right of center, like the Democratic party needs to be slightly left of center. The majority of the country (obviously) will not accept a party that has sold out to billionaires and Tea Party extremists any more than they would support a party that lobbied to ban all firearms and raise taxes across the board.
<p> My guess:Dig in deeper.Already OH Sec'y of State envisions allotting electoral votes based on party majority per district.Ergo,a majority of republican districts would have given Romney the state,regardless of the majority popular vote going to Obama.

<p> What I notice in Cruz statement is that he says they have to do better in the Latino vote not the minority vote. It sounds to me like he's saying don't worry about the black and the LGBT communities. They still haven't learned that they need to focus on all American citizens. Voter suppression, homophobia, Muslim bashing, stupid comments about women, abortion and rape.. These are also things that cost them votes.

<p> Spineless Republicans "forced to say outrageous things." What the GOP learned this election is that they can't simply Etch-a-Sketch away their statements calculated to rouse their base while alarming the rest of us. That is why Romney lost, not (as Paul Ryan believes) because the Dems got out the urban vote.

<p> The GOP became irrelevant when they decided to pick Mitt Romney. Come to think of it, no one was qualified including Mitt during the primary. Romney was just a BAD candidate and the GOP had to deal with his failure for many, many years.
