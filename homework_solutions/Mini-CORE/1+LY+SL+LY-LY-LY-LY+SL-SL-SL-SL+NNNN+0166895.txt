<h> As Soon As I'm Over You Lyrics
<h> Tammy Cochran
<p> I could force a smile Say at least I've loved for a little while Consider myself a one of the lucky few Spend the rest of all time Dreamin' of when you were mine Tryin' to make sense of goodbye Oh, but that's not what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get up, get out, get on with my life Gonna get back on my feet Say goodbye to the tears I've cried They won't get the best of me Take back what's mine, reclaim my pride And find me someone new I intend to love again As soon as I'm over you I won't dwell in the past I've got a one way ticket, not lookin' back Gonna travel to a town where I'm the someone new Start all over again Bring this heartache to an end Throw your memory to the wind Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get up, get out, get on with my life Gonna get back on my feet Say goodbye to the tears I've cried They won't get the best of me Take back what's mine, reclaim my pride And find me someone new I intend to love again As soon as I'm over you I'm gonna get up, get out, get on with my life Gonna get back on my feet Say goodbye to the tears I've cried They won't get the best of me Take back what's mine, reclaim my pride And find me someone new I intend to love again As soon as I'm over you Yeah, I intend to love again As soon as I'm over you, yeah Get on with my life, get up Get up, get on with my life
