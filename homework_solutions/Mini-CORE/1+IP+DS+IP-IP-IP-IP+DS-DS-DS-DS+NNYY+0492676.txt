<p> This was a big surprise for us. Coming to Rome and got such a great place to stay for a couple of days. Our stay at Domus Coppede was perfect. Nice and very helpful people in a beautiful building in the astonishing Coppede area. The room was also beautiful
<p> This was the best place we stayed on our whole trip through Italy. We were on a tight budget and when I saw this place online I thought it was too good to be true. their last check in is at 8:30pm but we had made arrangements for a slightly later check in as our train didn't get into Rome until 8:15pm. We would have got to there just on 8:30pm but there was an enormous queue for taxis when we came out of the station. we rang the B&B and they said it was no problemto hang on and to just ring when we were outside. Even at 40 minutes late we were warmly welcomed and shown to our room which was lovely. The shower was fantastic, the bed was amazing and the air con was very effective. It was so lovely to be able to relax with our breakfast in your room in the morning. We also had a very early check out at 7:30 am and we were accomodated with that very graciously! We didn't have time for breakfast so as we were standing at the reception desk we were offered crossaints etc. The fridge in the room is a great extra and two bottle of ice cold water were put in it every day. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because we could hear the noise from the shower in and toilet in the next room...but it was usually when we were due to wake up anyway. All in all we had a fantastic stay! The transport links are excellent. Within walking distance to the unmissable Borghese Gallery and the 38 bus will bring you to Termini station in 10-15 minutes where you can connect with all other transport to bring you all over the city. I really could reccommend this place highly enough to travellers on a budget and those not on a budget. You won't be dissapointed!
<p> We stayed at Domus Coppede for 4 nights. All the staff are very friendly and helpfull. The rooms and lobby are finished to a good standard and we felt very relaxed and at home there. Our room was very clean, with fresh bedding and towels every day. The location is a short bus ride from the historic centre of Rome and Marco was very helpfull when it came to telling us some good places to eat and where we could catch a bus from just round the corner, which takes you to Via del Tritone close to the Trevi Fountain. Just round the corner is Quartiere Copped which is worth a quick look as it's so close, some really intersting architecture from the early 1900's. We would deffinitly check if this place was available to stay at next time we were in Rome
