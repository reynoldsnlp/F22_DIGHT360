<h> Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer lyrics
<h> Song information
<h> Lyrics
<p> Just look at you sitting there You never looked better than tonight And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd stay Like I've done so many times I was so sure this would be the night You'd close the door And wanna stay with me And it'd be so easy To tell you I'd stay Like I've done so many times
<p> Don't fall in love with a dreamer Because he'll always take you in Just when you think You've really changed him He'll leave you again Don't fall in love with a dreamer Because he'll break you every time
<p> So put out the light and just hold on Before we say goodbye Now it's morning And the phone rings and ya say You gotta get your things together You just gotta leave Before you change your mind And if you knew What I was thinking girl, I'd turn around If you'd just ask me one more time Don't fall in love with a dreamer Because he'll always take you in Just when you think You've really changed him He'll leave you again Don't fall in love with a dreamer Because he'll break you every time So put out the light and just hold on Before we say goodbye
