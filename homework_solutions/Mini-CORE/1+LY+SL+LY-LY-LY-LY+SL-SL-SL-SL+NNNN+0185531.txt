<h> With a Little Bit of Luck Lyrics
<p> Alfred The Lord above gave man an arm of iron So he could do his job and never shirk. The Lord gave man an arm of iron-but With a little bit of luck, With a little bit of luck, Someone else'll do the blinkin' work! The three With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of luck you'll never work! Alfred The Lord above made liquor for temptation, To see if man could turn away from sin. The Lord above made liquor for temptation-but With a little bit of luck, With a little bit of luck, When temptation comes you'll give right in! The three With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of luck you'll give right in. Alfred Oh, you can walk the straight and narrow; But with a little bit of luck You'll run amuck! The gentle sex was made for man to marry, To share his nest and see his food is cooked. The gentle sex was made for man to marry-but With a little bit of luck, With a little bit of luck, You can have it all and not get hooked. The three With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of luck you won't get hooked. With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of bloomin' luck! Alfred The Lord above made man to help is neighbor, No matter where, on land, or sea, or foam. The Lord above made man to help his neighbor-but With a little bit of luck, With a little bit of luck, When he comes around you won't be home! Jim and Harry With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of luck, You won't be home. Alfred They're always throwin' goodness at you; But with a little bit of luck A man can duck! Oh, it's a crime for man to go philandrin And fill his wife's poor heart with grief and doubt. Oh, it's a crime for man to go philanderin'-but With a little bit of luck, With a little bit of luck, You can see the bloodhound don't find out! The three With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of luck she won't find out! With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of bloomin' luck! He doesn't have a tuppence in his pocket. The poorest bloke you'll ever hope to meet. He doesn't have a tuppence in his pocket-but With a little bit of luck, With a little bit of luck, He'll be movin' up to easy street. With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of luck, He's movin' up. With a little bit...with a little bit... With a little bit of bloomin luck!
