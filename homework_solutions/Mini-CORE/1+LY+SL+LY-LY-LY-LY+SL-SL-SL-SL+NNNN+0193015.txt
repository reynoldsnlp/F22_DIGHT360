<h> Something In The Way - Nirvana
<p> Underneath the bridge The tarp has sprung a leak And the animals I've trapped Have all become my pets And I'm living off of grass And the drippings from the ceiling But it's ok to eat fish Cause they haven't any feelings
<p> Something in the way Ummmmm Something in the way, yea Ummmmm Something in the way Ummmmm Something in the way, yea Ummmmm Something in the way Ummmmm Something in the way, yea Ummmmm
