<p> Tell us a bit about Doku Rai, what can we expect from the performance?
<p> Well its pretty interesting this is the first time that professional theatre has ever been made in Timor. By professional theatre I mean a theatre made with professional standard lights, sound, film, script, pretty much everything that goes into making a work of theatre. What was really interesting, is there were these artists over there that were working with us that are amazing painters, tattoo artists, sculptures, musicians, and amazing actors but they'd never really been in any theatre before. Some of them had been in films, but most of them had never acted before. In fact one of the guys who is playing one of the lead characters in our show is actually a biologist, he's a snake expert in Timor. The reason that we brought them all together was because each of them had this energy as people, but also in the way that they preformed. This energy really fitted in with the Australian actors that we were taking across. Mostly Theatre is pretty boring, to be honest.  Pretty straight, there's a story, there's some people on stage who open there mouth and talk, and the story kind of progresses.  When the Black Lung Theatre and Whaling Firm started making theatre they were like "stuff that! Were not interested in that kind of work. We're going to make theatre feel like its rock and roll! We want to make a show that makes people stand up in the audience in the middle show, yell about shaving monkeys, put on a funny hat and get on the stage. We want to make shows that literally blow someone's mind leaving them gibbering in the audience after the show. We want to make work that shows people things they've never seen before on stage."
<p> Is there a message your trying to convey through Doku Rai?
<p> In the show we started looking at a whole range of things. One of them was 'what does it mean when we talk about a cross-cultural collaboration?' You know, you're bringing artists from two very different worlds together, what does that mean? How do you negotiate who does what, who's ideas get taken up, who's voices are heard? So we started collecting stories from all the artists, from the Australia guys, from the Timorese guys. Just whatever stories they had, of there childhood, of adolescents. Then we starting weaving them in and finding parts of the stories that were a little like myths. You know how you can find stories from you past and it's a bit like a fable, or a bit make believe?  We found these parts of the stories and began weaving them all together to make this work, and that was the process of how it was made.
<p> What was it like creating a production on a remote island in an abandoned colonial hotel?
<p> Pretty crazy, I mean, it was kind of like camping, except we had to build prop stores and a costume department, a rehearsal stage. When we first got there, there was no power and no water, so we had to work really closely with the local community to try and get things like the water supply to the town. We were doing theatre, but we were also doing all this other giant stuff to get the place liveable. It was really interesting because we were a part of this small village with about one thousand people and so we became a part of that. We were on a bit of a hill, so people would come up with there kids, they'd visit us during the day. They'd see what we were doing, they'd stick around and watch rehearsals, we'd play music into the evening and musicians from the surrounding villages would come and visit us. We'd have these massive, crazy jam sessions which would go on into the night! Then there is the other aspect of being stuck together with this group of artists. Usually you can go home to your own bed and have some time out. But we never really got any of that. It was like making art in a commune  I suppose, like some crazy religious commute. We all went a little nuts at different times, but everyone still talks to each other now which is good, and no one got malaria and no one got killed, which was also a plus.
<p> Who inspires you?
<p> There's a guy called Steven Armstrong who's an amazing producer in Australia, there's also a woman called Michelle Wild, who's been a producer since well before I was even born. You know producers are the ones who really pull everything together and make sure that the environment for creating art is the best possible environment for the artist.
<p> How did you come to create Doku Rai?
<p> Well I knew the director from a few years before in fact I was his director at university. He had just finished filming Balibo, a feature film, -- he's also an actor -- so he just came back from playing a lead role in that and he sat down with me at the Darwin Festival in 2009 and said "man I've met this group of artists, there amazing, they think in the same way we do, I wanna make a work with them." I was like "great, who are these guys,?" He said "man they're Timorese." I was like "cool , but what about the language barrier?" He said "that will be a problem, they don't speak much English, but we'll just play some music together that'll get it started, that will be the language that we base everything off." So I went "great!" I'm from Darwin and Timor is our closest neighbour. I'd realised growing up here that I'd been to Indonesia a bunch of times, but I'd never been to Timor. I knew that there were Timorese people here, I knew they were around because I had known some of them but I felt like I had no connection with them. So I went "yeah, it'd be great to be able to start that connection between Darwin and Timor. Lets get some artists to Darwin and see what spirals out of this projects!"
<p> Do you have any advise for young people wishing to pursue similar careers to yourself?
<p> Yeah, do everything else first. The only way that I became a producers was because I started as a actor, then became a director, then I became a writer, then I was a dram terd*, then I started producing work, both mine and other peoples. I think to be a good producer you need to know what everyone else working for you does. You need to know what a production manager does, what a stage manager does. You need to know a bit about lighting design and sound design and how all that works. You need to know how to cut a promo video, how media works, how schedules run how to pay people properly. There are things you get exposed to and explained to you on the way. I think its very difficult to just go yep, I want to be a producer straight a way. I think its good to have a go at everything else, because you might realise your really enjoying lighting design or actually you're an amazing set designer and your career might suddenly go down that path. I think theatre is one of those industries where it's really inclusive so you can try out all of those things.
<p> What would you tell your 17-year-old self? I'm not going to get too personal but definitely a lot about love! I think I'd say your first instinct is probably the best.

<p> Good stuff Alex! Great to see the show and you) in Melbourne tonight and how pathetic that the Melb festival were not interested! Tells us something about our relationships with our 'neighbours'! Wish you and the group all the best for the tour and look forward to more work from this collaboration
