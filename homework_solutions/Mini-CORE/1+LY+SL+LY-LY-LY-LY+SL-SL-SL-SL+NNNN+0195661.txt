<p> Who would sell their soul for love? Or waste one tear on compromise Should be easy enough To know a heartache in disguise But the heart rules the mind And the going gets rough Pride takes the fall When you find that kind of love
<p> I can't help feeling like a fool Since I lost that place inside Where my heart knew its way And my soul was ever wise Once innocence was lost There was not faith enough Still my heart held on When it found that kind of love
<p> Though beauty is rare enough [From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/a/alison-kra\\... Still we trust Somehow we'll find it there With no guarantee It seems to me At least it should be fair
<p> But if it's only tears and pain Isn't it still worth the cost Like some sweet saving grace Or a river we must cross If we don't understand What this life is made of We learn the truth When we find that kind of love Cause when innocence is lost There is not faith enough We learn the truth When we find that kind of love
