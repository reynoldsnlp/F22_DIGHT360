<h> Who got the opportunity? Tanya Salehian

<p> Who got the opportunity? is a regular feature which profiles artists who've landed an opportunity that has been advertised on NAVA's Notice Board . If you've ever wondered who some of the jobs or prizes listed on the Notice Board have gone to, here is your chance to find out!
<p> Recently we caught up with artist Tanya Salehian who spoke to us about the numerous residencies she's undertaken throughout her career and the impact these have had on her work. You can read our interview with Tanya below.
<p> I draw landscapes at times, and at others, observations of people grounded in their setting. I am influenced by the figure existing in the space surrounding it. My figures are frequently imbued with a sense of alienation or separateness.
<p> NAVA: Tell us a bit about each of the residencies you've undertaken over the past couple of years. How did you become involved in each and how did you find the experience?
<p> TS: The most recent residency I undertook was this year at Can Serrat, near Barcelona in Spain. Sometimes the assessment of a residency is best done
<p> some time after the residency. However,  although I produced quite a lot of work following Can Serrat, I did not find the experience as fulfilling as others I have enjoyed, due to studio factors.
<p> I have been invited to complete at least six or seven residencies in all over the past fifteen years and each has been vastly different from the other.
<p> The very first was awarded to me by the University of New South Wales, College of Fine Art (COFA) at the Cite Internationale des Arts in Paris in 1997.  It was an experience of a lifetime for me. I did most of the preliminary work for my MFA whilst there and enjoyed the friendships and working experiences I had with artists from as far apart as South America, China, France as well as new friends from Australia. It was also a great opportunity to travel and to enjoy visits to galleries such as Monet's garden.
<p> The two other residencies that have had a great impact on my practice and development as an artist took place at the Vermont Studio Centre (2002) and the prestigious Leighton Studios at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta, Canada (2005).
<p> I found the Vermont Studio Centre residency one of great camaraderie. My friends and colleagues were again varied and the religious differences were marked so we celebrated Jewish events and well as Protestant and Buddhist. There were also opportunities to have consultations and critiquing sessions with well-known American artists, which was extremely useful and interesting.
<p> I have long loved American abstract expressionism and whilst I was there the work I made was abstract, on large pieces of canvas pinned to the wall.
<p> Many artists made impromptu sculptures or paintings from the ice and snow around during the month. Indeed one enterprising Korean sculptor created a musical 'xylophone' from icicles hanging from a roof.
<p> At the Banff Centre for the Arts I was awarded the 'Thom' architect designed  studio hut in the pine woods adjacent to the main Centre.  This was magnificent. The air was scented with pine and I even had bear claw marks on the thin tree trunk just outside my studio window.
<p> In addition to myself there were also writers, poets, scientists, dancers, and also business people. I made friends and working relationships with some poets from Alaska and Canada and also with other more curious artists, such as a person who was writing on terrorists and was being watched for involvement. The relationships made on these residencies have been an invaluable source of enrichment in the rest of my life.
<p> NAVA:  Do you have a favourite?
<p> TS: That's a hard one to separate relationships made, from the experience of the working process with its resulting completion in each residency. I would on the whole probably say the Banff Centre for the Arts, but the Vermont Studio centre comes a very close second.
<p> NAVA: Did any impact on the direction of your work in any way?
<p> TS: They all did.  Every residency had an impact because of the way my own work is influenced by the environment I am currently in.  The intellectual as well as the physical surroundings obviously impact on all aspects of the mind and therefore the work.
<p> However with one proviso -- most residencies expect a working program from the artist. Its up to oneself to set the parameters that give the most leeway.
<p> I found that the impact of the residency environment -- affected my working process in either positive or negative ways. If my project intention was clear then outside influences had an enriching effect. In most cases my interest in particular art movements dictated the methods I would use. The environment was the background to the work. In Paris it was the squares and architecture; in Canada the Rockies and flying; in Vermont it was the deep red of the wooded buildings, the ice and American abstract expressionism before the eighties.
<p> NAVA: What do have coming up next?
<p> TS: I have a small studio littered with half finished paintings and drawings from my latest residency in Spain this past April. Finishing these is the next project.
<p> NAVA: Where can we see your work?
<p> TS: My name is on Google....somehow most of what I have done is there.
