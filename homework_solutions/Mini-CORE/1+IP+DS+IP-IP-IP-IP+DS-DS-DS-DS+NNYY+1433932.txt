<h> Book Description
<p> Publication Date: 1 Jan 2008
<p> The Third Sector includes all those organisations commonly referred to as non-profit or not-for-profit. It includes Charities, Social Enterprises, Community Businesses and other organisations set up for social purposes, rather than for generating profits for investors.
<p> There are a number of books produced and aimed at people who work or volunteer in the Third Sector. This book is an attempt to demystify Social Enterprise for a general reader.
<p> Why does Social Enterprise matter? It matters because it represents an alternative way of looking, at how business works, how it impacts society and how social ends can be delivered differently from the traditional philanthropic charity model.
