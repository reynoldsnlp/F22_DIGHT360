<p> NB: The floor plan of Pedfield Country House shows that the host lives in the same house but has a separate wing. The dining room is equipped with a fridge, microwave, toaster & jug but there is no kitchen. We offer semi self catering for those who wish to dine out in the evenings, OR in the summer there is use of the BBQ out on the patio. The floor plan also shows there is only 1 bathroom with a shower, bath, toilet and vanity with 1 hand basin. Pedfield Country House is a lovely spacious villa built in 1909 and has retained it's original ambiance and is suitable for those guests who appreciate and respect what it is Pedfield Country House has to offer.

<p> Pedfield was posted as max 6 pp,but she agreed to take 8 of us.We found that it was a challenge to share a combined toilet and bathroom during our 3d/2n stay there.For future hirers, just be aware that you don't have access to the kitchen and there is only one basin in the bathroom.One of us had taken the towel from the cupboard-if she doesnt want us to use any other things, she should lock the cupboard.We were told by her, she will take care of the cleaning.We will not be back at Pedfield
<p> Kim my marketing also clearly states to please leave my home the way you find it... when you all left the dining room and bedrooms had much rubbish and chippies ground into the floor in one bedroom. I have been enjoying running an accommodation business for nearly 5 years and have never experienced guests that appear to have no respect for others boundaries, property or home, it has put me off having teenagers again in my home or accommodating guests who request to sleep more than 6...
