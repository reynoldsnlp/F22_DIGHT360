<p> Florence and the Machine (styled as Florence + the Machine ) [ 4 ] are an English indie rock band, consisting of lead singer Florence Welch , Isabella "Machine" Summers , and a collaboration of other artists. The band's music had received praise across the media, especially from the BBC , before they gained mainstream success. Specifically, the BBC played a large part in their rise to prominence by promoting Florence and the Machine as part of BBC Introducing .
<p> The band's debut studio album, Lungs , was released on 6 July 2009, and held the number-two position for its first five weeks on the UK Albums Chart . [ 5 ] On 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position, after being on the chart for twenty-eight consecutive weeks. [ 6 ] As of October 2010, the album had been in the top forty in the United Kingdom for sixty-five consecutive weeks, making it one of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010. The group's second studio album, Ceremonials , released in October 2011, entered the charts at number one in the UK and number six in the US.
<p> The name of Florence and the Machine is attributed to Florence Welch 's teenage collaboration with Isabella "Machine" Summers . Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, "The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad." [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
<p> In addition to Summers (keyboards and backing vocals), the current band members include musicians Robert Ackroyd (guitar and backing vocals), Chris Hayden (drums, percussion and backing vocals), Mark Saunders (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Tom Monger (harp).

<p> In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. This album included the earliest version of her later hit " Kiss with a Fist ", which at this point was titled "Happy Slap". [ 13 ] She signed a contract for Ashok with a manager, but feeling that she was "in the wrong band" she resigned, which cancelled the contract. [ 9 ] Florence and the Machine are managed by Mairead Nash (one half of the DJ duo Queens of Noize ), who decided to manage the singer when an inebriated Welch followed Nash into the toilets at a club [ 9 ] [ 14 ] and sang Etta James ' 1962 song " Something's Got a Hold on Me ". [ 15 ]
<p> Florence and the Machine released their first album Lungs in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2009. The album was produced by James Ford , Paul Epworth , Steve Mackey and Charlie Hugall. [ 8 ] Much of the material on the album was written as reaction to what turned out to be a temporary break-up with Welch's former boyfriend. Welch said, "He prefers me not to talk about it.

<p> Initially, Welch considered offers from the band's record label to record their second album in the United States to work with writers and producers in Los Angeles, [ 50 ] but ultimately decided to record the album in the UK. The first demo session occurred in January 2010 with Welch and Paul Epworth at a small London studio. Numerous producers expressed an interest in working on the album but Welch rejected the offers because she wanted Ceremonials to be a better version of Lungs with a "more dark, more heavy, bigger drum sounds, bigger bass, but with more of a whole sound". For the rest of the year work on the album continued only intermittently as the band concentrated on an extensive tour of the United States, where Lungs had become popular. The majority of the writing for the album was done between January and April 2011, with recording taking place in April at Abbey Road Studios . Refinement took place at Epworth's own London studios while Welch recorded vocal tracks in various US studios, during days off from touring.
