<p> The thirst for notoriety sends some men nearly mad At last my chance has come and I with joy and pride feel glad The name of Smith you soon will see in the 'Telegraph' each day I'm elected in the County Council, Hip, Hip, Hip, hooray!
<p> Chorus: I'm a member of the County Council And as sure as dicky birds eat grounsel I'll make it jolly hot I'll upset the blessed lot Will this member of the County Council.
<p> We can't be bigger duffers than the poor old Board of Works And, anyhow, our Council shan't become a 'Board of Perks' With Roseberry for Chairman (and the best one, under circs.) We shall never have a chance of being called the Board of Shirks.
<p> Chorus: He's the Chairman of the County Council And as sure as dicky birds eat grounsel He'll make it jolly hot For each loud unruly lot Will our Chairman of the County Council.
<p> Now every meeting I'll attend and shout 'Hear! Hear!' and 'Shame' They curse and swear in Parliament, so I shall do the same I'll make speech whene'er I like, whether I make friends or foes And if I can't catch the Chairman's eye, I'll punch the Chairman's nose.
<p> Chorus: I'm a member of the County Council And as sure as dicky birds eat grounsel I'll make it jolly hot I'll upset the blessed lot Will this member of the County Council.
