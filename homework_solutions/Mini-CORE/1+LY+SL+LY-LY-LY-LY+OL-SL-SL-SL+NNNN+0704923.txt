<h> A Million Hungry Eyes
<p> I remember in Red Square The monuments to us A little toxin in our drinks Had turned our tongues to rust
<p> It's so hard to believe you're a swan The curtains hang half-drawn You wait for earth or sun to bring you dawn
<p> A million hungry mouths Would strip you to your bones And every note would still Be perfectly in tune A million hungry eyes Would strip you to your clothes And everyone would still They'd say you hung the moon
<p> You brought me pages of hardcore torn And casts of lovers yet unborn You carried me across the room in a swoon To soon forget you hung the moon
<p> A million hungry mouths Would strip you to your bones And every note would still Be perfectly in tune A million hungry eyes Would strip you to your clothes And everyone would still They'd say you hung the moon
<p> Be quiet on the set Take one Be quiet on the set Take two Be quiet on the set...
<h> Just Try
<p> You almost turned inside out Found you down by the boats Fell asleep in my arms Under northern lights that danced like ghosts
<p> If you can't contain yourself, my dear Just try, just try, your time is near
<p> Like the summer's last day A coming chill in the air Before the leaves turn to fire As the sunlight plays in your hair
<p> It seems like a thousand years Since you last stayed the night But something's changed inside you now You're not afraid to come back and fight
<p> When you can't contain yourself, my dear Just try, just try, I'll hold you near You can't contain yourself this time Betrayed by something so sublime
<p> I love your need Your joy in grief You bring relief To me
<h> Come On
<p> Come on I want to raise the roof tonight I want to scare the dark to light It's been too long since we took flight Come on, come on, join me Come on
<p> We're more than water over the bridge We're more than tearing down the rich Call me a raging sentimentalist Come on, come on, join me Come on
<p> Come on It's time we think before we fight It's time to fight before we die It's time to love before we're dry Come on, come on, join me Come on
<h> I Will Wait For You
<p> If it takes forever I will wait for you For a thousand summers I will wait for you Till you're back beside me till I'm holding you Till I hear you sigh here in my arms.
<p> Anywhere you wander anywhere you go Every day just remember how I love you so In your heart believe what in my heart I know That forevermore I'll wait for you.
<p> The clock'll tick away the hours one by one Then the time will come when all the waiting's done The time when you return and find me here and run Straight to my waiting arms.
<p> If it takes forever I will wait for you For a thousand summers I will wait for you Till you're here beside me till I'm touching you And forevermore sharing your love.
<h> Fashion Tips For The Homeless
<p> Every comfort I once had is now consumed by flame Burning bright I set alight I am the spark of change Yeah
<p> Ashes to the sky Ashes to the sky
<p> Above the clouds the sun shines always, fly now while you can
<p> That dirty hippy on the street he's Jesus in disguise Actually it's just me goofin', I kinda have his eyes
<p> So where can we get high? Yeah where can we get high?
<p> All the grains of sand are slipping quickly from your hand
<p> All the perfect worlds inside you spill out when you wake Warm, soft bodies wrap around you feel their tender ache
<p> Burning up inside Burning up inside
<p> If you were god would you be willing to blame it on your plan?
<h> Watching You Sleep
<p> All I do is make you cry It's a long beginning to a short end I Miss you so much when you're not around I'm going to miss you when you're off the rebound
<p> I lay awake every night with you beside me Your breathing keeps perfect time with my pulse The happiest I've ever been is in these times when I watch you sleep and the world is perfect
<p> The happiest I've ever been is in these times when I watch you sleep and the world is perfect
<p> Ten to one you don't snore Twenty to one you won't hear the front door Hundred to one you don't wake Zero to sixty in three seconds hope my brakes Work
<p> Don't ever say I didn't care
<p> I lay awake every night with you beside me Your breathing keeps perfect time with my pulse The happiest I've ever been is in these times when I watch you sleep and the world is perfect
<p> The happiest I've ever been is in these times when I watch you sleep and the world is perfect
<p> Thanks to science we've got love
<h> My Wasted Youth
<p> My wasted youth
<p> I've been thinking about my wasted youth Don't remember much from all your dry vermouth Haven't spoken with nobody from those days back then Except for you and I miss you man As sad as we were it was funny Just where did we steal all our money?
<p> Where has everyone gone From that rum soaked dawn?
<p> My wasted youth
<p> The years washed by in my wasted youth Got drunk most nights, now that's the truth No surprise that nothing meaningful ever came of it Except for this song of impotent regret Now our brothers and sisters have children And I wonder if they're going to listen
<p> Now everyone's gone When the dusk turns dawn
<p> My doctor said, "it's no good for your heart" But if I remember my heart played no part In anybody's life except through the drink Or so I'd like to think
<p> I've been thinking about my wasted youth The small town bars and your dry vermouth
<p> My wasted youth
<h> Your Secret's Out
<p> I woke today my head on fire I don't recall a thing from last night The kind of drugs you shoveled down My throat disgraced this sickly town
<p> I don't know what you did to me I fell so hard so easily I know your type, you scream and shout But fake the end, your secret's out
<p> A cocktail bar and Rohypnol I could have sworn I've tried it all But something else got in my veins If I'm in love it's still called rape
<p> I don't have much as evidence The clues I've got, they make no sense I'm paralyzed, but sober now I've seen firsthand your secret's out
<p> I don't know what you did to me I felt so loved on ecstasy I know your type, you scream and shout But fake the end, your secret's out I don't know what you did to me I fell so hard so easily I know your type, you scream and shout But fake the end, your secret's out
<h> The Kind Of Girl I Am
<p> Any minute you'll walk through that door And I'll have to tell you I don't love you anymore, no more But then I'll surprise you with twelve roses in a vase And take your hand and a deep breath and pause Pull you closer so you see my little flaws I never was Too insecure To try your bras 'Cause that's the kind of girl I am Yeah, that's the kind of girl I am 'Cause that's the kind of girl I am The kind of girl I am...
<p> Remember when we moved the furniture around? All around us the house burned to the ground with no sound That night you gave me twelve roses in a vase You took my hand and pulled me closer to your face One on the shoulder one hand around your waist And I could taste Upon your lips The human race
<p> You said that's the kind of girl I am Yeah, that's the kind of girl I am 'Cause that's the kind of girl I am The kind of girl I am...
<p> Cynical to the end Destitute to the end Comical to the end Scared and wild
<p> Pull you closer and you're pulling back the claws Effect and cause You put your life Between the jaws 'Cause that's the kind of girl I am Yeah, that's the kind of girl I am 'Cause that's the kind of girl I am The kind of girl I am...
<h> All Over You
<p> Nothing you can say Can make me stay away today
<p> Because I'm all over you, you tease I'm in your hair and in the air you breathe
<p> All over you
<p> We are the spinning stars This burst of light and heat is ours
<p> And I'm all over you like naked skin So say your prayers and swear another sin
<p> All over you
<p> But maybe I'll be over you as you're over me If you're the supernova -- I'm the stars on the sea
<p> Because I'm all over you Yes, like yesterday's news
<p> All over you
<h> The End Of The Tape
<p> The end of the tape Nothing to say The last escape My last free day
<p> Little things that stick Tiny scabs to pick It fell from the sky In the water supply The end of the tape Pillage, plunder and rape Away
