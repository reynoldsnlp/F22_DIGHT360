<p> And it's alright with me And it's easy to see There's one thing that you out to know It's just got me feeling out of control Cause you took me to my soul And baby you don't have to go
<p> You don't have to leave, no, no [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/black+crowe\\... ] When you speak to me It's like a dream And I feel every word And I know just what each word means, yes I do When you sleep with me Oh girl, the safety that it brings In my heart, in my mind I will love you for all time, yes I will
