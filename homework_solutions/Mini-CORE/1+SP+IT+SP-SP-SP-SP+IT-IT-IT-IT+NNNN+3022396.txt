<h> Michael Schumacher: "Formula 1 has become much calmer"
<p> In the second part extensive interviews Welt am Sonntag said Schumacher of change in Formula 1 in recent years and shared the outlook for the future ...
<p> Q: In the last four races in Formula 1 you will try to make up for previous failures? Michael Schumacher : I think I have proved everything. I will try again as laid out - who knows, maybe we'll find little that separates us from the fight for the podium. Hope springs eternal.
<p> Q: With whom did you discuss the decision about retirement? Michael Schumacher : With those with whom I discuss these issues. He was about 80 years and I consider him as a guide. With him I consulted about the return to Formula 1. Of course, another important person in my life - my wife, but I ask for advice to his father and friends.
<p> Q: Who would you advise other athletes to return to professional sports? Michael Schumacher : Fortunately, in our sport such return is possible, and I proved it. If you are player and you are already over forty, you can not play at the level of the Champions League after a three year hiatus.
<p> Q: In 2006 you announced the departure of three stages before the end of the season, which fought for the title to Alonso. This year, you made a statement for the six races before the end of the season, and in the individual event takes quite a low position. Have you ever thought to leave early? Michael Schumacher No, never. I have a contractual obligation, and not my style to leave early.
<p> Q: How difficult was the decision? Michael Schumacher : Not as complicated as many people think. When I left in 2006, the emotions were more vivid. Then the question of my resignation discussed in the course of the season, and now many were sure that I will stay in Formula 1, and in the Mercedes made it clear that they would like to continue working with me. I had a lot of options, but I made that decision.
<p> Q: You will continue to play sports? Michael Schumacher : Of course, now I'll train less intensively than before. After the end of the season, I, first of all, take a rest - I did it all the time, though not one of those who can just lie on the couch. Sports have always been part of my life, so I have at any time there will be many opportunities.
<p> Q: Known in F1 people, particularly Eddie Jordan and Flavio Briatore, believe that you can not live without the adrenaline. Is it enough that your wife is going to buy a horse? Michael Schumacher : Some talk too much, discussing me behind my back. Briatore ever piloted a race car? I think not. No one has a complete picture of me.
<p> Question: Are you satisfied that the hype around your career Mercedes will soon stop? Michael Schumacher : Of course, sometimes it is stressful, but I coped with it very well.
<p> Q: Are you able to maintain privacy? Michael Schumacher : I helped move to Switzerland. Now we can not complain about the lack of privacy.
<p> Question: Are you burdened glory? Michael Schumacher : From the very beginning of his career. Of course, in a situation where things are not going well, particularly in the last three years, there is even an advantage - popularity is less intrusive.
<p> Question: How performance in Mercedes will show in your image? Michael Schumacher Unfortunately, still continue to talk about statistics and glasses. In the last three years we have completely replaced the team of engineers. I think in the future, the team will build a high-end car, I hope it will happen in the next season.
<p> Q: Lewis Hamilton will benefit from your work? Michael Schumacher : I think so. I'm not a designer and an expert on aerodynamics, but I feel like I helped the team to progress.
<p> Question: What did you think when you see the following spring on the TV as Lewis Hamilton in overalls Mercedes Cup awarded? Michael Schumacher : First of all, I have to find a channel broadcasting the race (laughs). Of course, I would like to see some of the Grand Prix, but not all. I'll be happy for Lewis and the team if they will succeed. I think I even have a drink, because I, too, have contributed to this success.
<p> Question: Do you think you will be able to settle in Lewis Hamilton Mercedes, because this year it steps outside the track attracted a lot of attention? Michael Schumacher : I did not know Lewis - no more than what they write about it in the press.
<p> Q: Many people say that failure to return to Formula 1 Schumacher made inaccessible before more human. Do you agree? Michael Schumacher : Yes and no. I am the same as before, but has become more open and stopped giving way to despair in difficult situations - I have learned to cope with them. I became more relaxed, and it all felt.
<p> I can not say that has changed dramatically. I just removed the barrier that previously enjoyed in the paddock. However, I still can not just stop and have a coffee, but everything was calmer than before. While some left ...
<p> Q: What is it? Michael Schumacher : First Formula 1 has been very popular, and now we are going through a difficult period in the economy, and it is felt. On the race track comes less viewers, because they want to spend money more efficiently. In my speeches in Ferrari was more interest in the championship, now the situation is much calmer.
<p> Question: Many people say that after you leave some degree of vacuum ... Michael Schumacher Yes, I heard about that. If it was not, so I did something wrong.
<p> Q: Can Vettel fill that void? Michael Schumacher : In Formula 1 is not only Sebastian Vettel - we have many German drivers. I think this year he won it - at least until things are going in his favor. He has a chance to be in the future, "Mr. Formula 1" in Germany.
<p> Question: What can bring it out of balance: attention or busy schedule? Did you talk to him about these issues? Michael Schumacher : This is a small problem, which in any case remain, so any driver, being in Formula 1, has put up with them. Like I said, now it has become much calmer.
<p> Question: high salary these shortcomings? Michael Schumacher : It would be too obvious, although our work has its advantages. It's great when you admire people who share your passion for motorsports. Of course, sometimes you prefer to rest.
<p> Q: You are traveling on a private jet, stay in expensive hotels, and in the pit lane may get only a few. Tell me honestly, how closely do you communicate with ordinary people? Michael Schumacher : When you pass through the circle back to the pits and see the happy faces, it is very close contact. All come to the race track, to support you, they respect you and anxiously perceive your success. You feel positive attitude. This alone indicates that you are in luck.
