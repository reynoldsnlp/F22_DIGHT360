<h> Book Description
<p> Release Date: September 26, 2006
<p> This is not your father's war
<p> This is Iraq, where a soldier's first duty is reinforcing his Humvee with sheet metal and sand bags. Or, in the absence of plumbing, burning barrels of human waste. Where any dead dog on the side of the road might be concealing an insurgent's bomb and anyone could be the enemy.
<p> At age 17, Jason Christopher Hartley joined the Army National Guard. Thirteen years later, he is called to active duty, to serve in Iraq. Sent to a town called Ad Dujayl, made notorious by Saddam Hussein's 1982 massacre, Hartley is thrust into the center of America's war against terrorism. This is his story.
<p> "If you are distrustful of the media and want to know exactly what's going on in Iraq, you'll have to pray for divine enlightenment, because only god knows what the hell is going on over here. However, if you want to know how it feels to be a soldier in Iraq, to hear something honest and raw, that I can help you with."
<p> Sometimes profane, often poignant, and always nakedly candid, Just Another Soldier takes the reader past the images seen on CNN and the nightly news, into the day to day reality of life on the ground as an infantryman, attached to the 1st Division, in the first war of the 21st century. From the adrenaline rush of storming a suspected insurgent's house, to the sheer boredom of down time on the base, to the horror of dead civilians, Hartley examines his role as a man, as a soldier and as an American on foreign soil. His quest to discover the balance between his compassionate side and his baser instincts, results in a searing portrait of today's Army and a remarkable personal narrative written in a fresh and exciting new voice. Just Another Soldier is more than a war story; it delivers an intimate look at a generation of young men and women on the front lines of American policy.
<p> Whether you're for or against the war in Iraq, this is essential reading.

<p> I was there with Jason... And he captures everything to a T. Reading the book I can laugh cause when he gets into things I remember I just start laughing cause to be being over there is mostly a blur and I'm so happy that he has captured it for all to read. Great Job Sgt. Hartley, I remember it took me a month to get the internet to work steady. It was like routing a 56k to 18 people but I got it done and you were able to get your site out there and work on this book while it was happing rather then trying to remember which the reason I think this book is is so truthful. Happy to go there and come home with you Sgt. Hartley, - Spec. Justin Marshall A Co. 2/108th INF
<p> This semi-diary format book about a soldier's year in Iraq provides an insight into what the average front line infantry goes through. It doesn't cover the big picture. It doesn't cover the issues that the news media talks about. It's what the rifle carrying soldier sees, does, thinks as he goes through is deployment.
<p> His story sounds a lot like stories of other veterans. In fact I remember a book by a fellow named McBride from World War I. 'I didn't mind the war, but I hated the hell out of the Army.'
<p> The book is a good mix of stories of the day to day life, going out into bad guy country, and the view from life at the bottom of the Army. I can certainly say that life in the Army hasn't changed much from my time in it (which was from before the author was born.
<p> The web site contains a large collection of pictures.
<p> Well written, very interesting. I'm not so sure what it all means, it's just part of a life of a soldier.
<p> I picked up this book because I wanted to read a first-hand account of what's going on in Iraq. If you are looking for a book full of combat and killing people, this book is not for you. There is combat and gunfire in the book, but it is much more than that. Hartley talks about things as trivial as getting lost in Humvees to difficult issues such as dealing with the death of a friend. The book is what you would expect from an infantryman but at the same time rather philosophical at times. A good read.
