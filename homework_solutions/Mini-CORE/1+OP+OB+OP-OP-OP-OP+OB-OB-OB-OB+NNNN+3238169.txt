<h> The other side of 9/11-Could the unthinkable be true?
<p> "What if" can be a deadly combination of words. Well maybe, maybe not. I try to leave "what ifs" out of my mind because it tends to cause too much stress/anxiety, like things are out of my control. But sometimes, just sometimes, a "what if" can get you thinking. To think about the other side of things, if only for a short period of time. This past weekend I watched a video called "Loose Change" that did exactly that: got me thinking.
<h> "Loose Change"
<p> "Loose Change" was created by four guys: Dylan Avery, Korey Rowe, Matthew Brown, Daniel Sunjata , and a production company called Collective Minds Media . The premise of the video questions everything the public knows and was told about 9/11 and the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. It includes a compilation of information that  are now public record, which you may not have heard about. There are in depth interviews, media coverage, documentations, news coverage, testimonies, all the details that might not have been told until now.  I know I sure didn't know about it. Then again, when it comes to the news I tend to be a little naive because I'm not really engaged. So I went into this with an open mind.
<p> So why does it spark curiosity? Maybe anger? Maybe disbelief? Like I said it contains a lot information that you may not know or have heard of. The purpose is to raise questions about who was really behind the 9/11 attack : was it really Osama or could it have been fueled by the unthinkable: the US.
<p> This is not a video stating without question that the US was a part of the attack or was behind the attack. It is a call to action to show people that not ALL things were as they appeared. You were shielded from things, not told things, things that were changed to appease the general population. This is not a video that was put together over night with a bunch of youtube videos. It presents hard facts, real evidence that nobody can deny.
<p> You're probably thinking how dare I even say this, that is absurd, you're just a conspiracy theorist. I love America, and  I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.  But whether you like it or not, you are not given the truth all the time. Maybe you turn a blind eye and don't want to know, maybe you just really don't know. The choice is yours what to believe. I'm just giving you another resource to consider before making any judgements.
<p> I'm not saying one side or the other is true, but it did open my eyes to a few things. I want you to make your own opinions, but I urge you to watch this. It is years later, and we still don't have all the answers..seriously. Hopefully all those affected will get peace of mind one day, and we can prevent something like this from EVER happening again.
<p> A little background info about me..I've grown up and lived in Atlanta for the past 14 years and have loved it! I did sports throughout my childhood but fell in love with gymnastics and followed that passion all the way to college where I was a member of the University of Georgia gymnastics team. When graduation was nearing, and I was figuring out what I wanted to do for a career, I knew that I had a passion for sports as well as for my major, advertising. I ended up getting an internship with Nike that took me to the state of Oregon on their home base. I got to see and meet the most amazing athletes, be part of a whirlwind of marketing and media events and products, and basically have the time of my life! However I realized that the south is where my home is, so I came back to pursue a career here in Atlanta. It took some time, but I did land a position at a media rep firm and have been there for a little over a year. It's definitely a good starting point for me, but I know that there's more out there and I'm hoping Empower Network will lead me there!
