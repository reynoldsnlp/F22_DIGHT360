<h> Why Rick Perry Needs to Be Called Out on His Climate Denying
<p> How can Texas governor and presidential candidate Rick Perry talk so irresponsibly about global warming -- and get away with it?
<p> Have we really reached a point where, in order to appeal to the hard core of the Republican Party, candidates have to ignore the fact that the earth is getting warmer, and that human activities are responsible?
<p> Let's hope not. Because if true, that's sad and worrisome. Without Republican backing, no serious effort to regulate greenhouse gas emissions can be enacted by the U.S. Congress.
<p> To be sure, Democrats aren't much better when it comes to straight political talk. Just ask Barack Obama, Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi how they plan to close the federal deficit. But they are at least operating in a universe that resembles the one in which we live.
<p> I do believe that the issue of global warming has been politicized. I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects. I think we're seeing it almost weekly or even daily, scientists who are coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. Yes, our climates change. They've been changing ever since the earth was formed. But I do not buy into, that a group of scientists, who in some cases were found to be manipulating this data.
<p> This wasn't a slipup. In his book Fed-Up: Our Fight To Save America From Washington, Perry says that the "so-called science (of global warming) may not stand the test of time" and calls Al Gore "the false prophet of a carbon cult." While Perry's attack on climate science generated a flurry of media attention, most of the reporting tiptoed around the fact that, well, he just doesn't know what he is talking about.

<p> SABMiller, WWF and the German International development agency (GIZ) are imploring other companies and NGOs to participate in the Water Futures Partnership, which they created in 2009 to show the business case for the private sector to promote sustainable water resources management.
<p> Part of a two-year agreement announced today by the automaker and carsharing leader will put as many as 1,000 new Fords into Zipcar's campus fleet -- potentially building customers for Ford as well as changing driver behavior.
<p> The fifth annual edition of our State of Green Business report continues our efforts to measure the environmental impacts of the emerging green economy. In addition to documenting what progress companies are making -- if any -- in improving their environmental performance, we track larger trends that will affect corporate America in 2012.
