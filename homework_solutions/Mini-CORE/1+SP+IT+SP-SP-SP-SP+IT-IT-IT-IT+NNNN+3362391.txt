<h> Country music sweetheart Kira Isabella talk's boys, fashion and her passion for music!
<p> Ottawa's own country star, Kira Isabella performed at Algonquin College Monday night where she performed acoustic versions of some of her hit songs such as Love me like that, Little White Church, A Real Good Radio, My Diary and even a cover of Lady Gaga's You and I.  She was joined on stage by her guitarist and frequently joined in conversation with the crowd of fans that came to see her at Algonquin College stating "I know you guys, this is home".
<p> 613Style got a chance to sit with the songstress where we discussed fashion, music and of course boys!
<p> 613Style: Do you still get nervous before performing for shows or was it just because it was Ottawa?
<p> Kira: You know what, I never get as nervous as I got today...that's a weird thing for me, I always get butterflies and I get really anxious...But I don't know, it's just really different because all these people that I am seeing in front of me, usually were just hanging out together in a room and I'm not sitting in a chair facing them singing for 45 minutes..so..it was really nerve wracking  today. It was really really fun and I'm glad I got to do it.
<p> 613Style: Perfect. And what do you think is the most surreal moment in this whole journey of yours since starting your career?
<p> Kira: Oh my gosh, um...other than winning the CCMA for a Rising Star this year, that was pretty surreal moment. That was incredible for me, um, mostly just because I really took that moment as being completely accepted into the Canadian country music family. That's all I ever really wanted you know. But probably, the most surreal crazy thing that's happened was opening up for Carrie Underwood. That's kinda like a pinch yourself you still don't wake up kind of moment.
<p> 613Style: And you've met her and things like that?
<p> Kira: Yeah, she's so nice. She was like 'is there anything I can do to make this a better experience for you, let me know'. I was like Carrie, it's fine. This is pretty amazing. I'm good (Giggling)
<p> 613Style: Did she give you any great advice in terms of this music industry?
<p> Kira: Um, you know, she didn't really give me very much advice. She's really a busy lady and I only got to talk to her for a minute but she did get a chance to see my show and she had some nice things to say about it and that was pretty crazy.
<p> 613Style: Awesome!
<p> Kira: It was on twitter too so that was wild!
<p> 613Style: So we represent 613Style, so what are your favourite stores in Ottawa?
<p> Kira: Oh my gosh! Where do I start?!  Um...I really like Bang On downtown where you can make t-shirts and stuff. It's really really cool -- I like to make sweaters there. Um... pretty much anywhere in Rideau. I really really like Zara. And I love the huge Urban Outfitters on Rideau Street. That's my favourite. I can go there for like hours and hours.
<p> 613Style: Okay so how would you describe your fashion style?
<p> Kira: Um, I mean its country but with a little edge. And I really really like -- you'll probably see me half the time dressed up kinda 50s. I really like the 50s look. In "A Little More Work", I'm kinda wearing sorta of a 50s thing.
<p> 613Style: And, you mentioned that you do write some of your songs. And who is the inspiration behind the love songs?
<p> Kira: (giggling)
<p> 613Style: I have to ask, my Editor will kill me if I don't (laughter)
<p> Kira: Know I know (laughter)..putting out this album is like half of love songs and I'm like, I don't want to talk about this. It's fine. I have been working on this album for like four years like I said so it's kinda like my diary. So there's pretty much -  I guess you can say there's been kinda been one person that it's about and who will remain nameless.  But um, he actually helped me with my album. He's on my album. He wrote a couple of songs for me.
<p> 613Style: Oh, awesome.
<p> Kira: Yeah it's pretty awesome. I mean, it all comes from personal experience.  And also, I like to put myself in other people's shoes.
<p> 613Style: Okay and lastly, how hard was it to tell your parents that you wanted to pursue music and not go to University or college?
<p> Kira: Not hard at all. I've been singing since I was really really little. My parents used to say, when I was a baby, I had a really weird cry. They say my cry was like ..... (imitates a baby crying). Really like bravado almost.  And so they kinda always have known that I've loved music. They put me in lessons when I was 6 years old.  I expressed interest in singing lessons. I got on the stagefor the first time when I was 7. I really have been doing this my whole entire life and kinda...my parents always kinda knew that after highschool that I was going to do whatever it took to do this. I was going to pursue this and I have the most supportive parents in the world. They would take me to pretty much almost anywhere in Ontario if I found a singing competition or something I wanted to perform at. They would pack up the car and take me there. It was never even an option. They just have always let me do what I needed to do.
<p> 613Style: Perfect..and that's a wrap! (laughter)
