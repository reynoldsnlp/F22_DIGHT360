<p> Sudanese club side  El Amal's coach Mohamad 'Al Deeba' Muhideen says he will stick with the same team in this weekend's  Orange CAF Confederation Cup return match against Interclube of Angola. Al Deeba believes that his team is capable of overturning  the 4-1 defeat to the Angolans . Al Deeba told Cafonline.com that encounter between the two sides on  Sunday in Atabara city, in north Sudan will different to that one played in Luanda two weeks ago
<p> Cafonline.com : What would you attribute your defeat to Interclube in Luanda to?
<p> Al Deeba :  We committed fatal errors in the second half and that is what cost us. We managed to hold on to a 1-1 draw in the first half which means we were succeeded in a tough match. I know it has been said our fitness failed us towards the end of the match but that  is not true we just lost focus and concentration at the wrong time. .
<p> Cafonline.com : How have the preparations to face the Angolans been going?
<p> Al Deeba :  I am worried by how we seem to repeat the costly errors.  In our last game against Al Hilal of Kadugli in the local League match on Tuesday we made the same mistakes and lost as well. We have started to solve these problems and worked hard ahead of the Interclube match so if we cut out the errors we stand a chance to overturn the result from two weeks ago. .
<p> Cafonline.com: How can  El Amal overturn the Luanda defeat?
<p> Al Deeba :  I am hoping we can be more clinical in front of goal and put away the chances we create.  One of the biggest problems is the last few matches recently has been missing opportunities in front of goal, it happened against Al Hilal and Al Ahly of Shandi as well as against InterClube in Angola. We have the ability to do well if we utilize our chances. We still have a strongly present and belief we can win  but we have to offer all our effort in terms of fitness and mentality in Sunday's game to make we progress to the next stage of the competition.
<p> Cafonline.com What is your assessment of  Interclube's play?
<p> Al Deeba : InterClube is a good side with ability to move swiftly into attacking play. They are on the wings too but we also observed some areas of their game we can exploit to out advantage in Sunday's match in Atbara .
<p> Cafonline.com : What are your major concerns ahead of the second leg?
<p> Al Deeba :   I am really worried about the team repeating  errors that have cost us matches lately infact this worries me more than InterClube itself  despite our loss in Luanda. I wish the defensive line can get it right and play as an organized unit.
