<h> Electric cars energise the presidential campaign
<p> Mon, 2012-10-29 16:48
<p> Ahead of the presidential election, we look at the state of electric motoring which has proven a microcosm for the role that government ought to play in America's recovery.
<p> Last month saw electric battery company A123 Systems file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after production problems and weaker than expected demand for electric vehicles which were the largest users of the company's lithium batteries.
<p> Fuelling the debate is the fact that A123 was the recipient of $250 million of government loans which prompted Mitt Romney to challenge president Obama about his commitment to sponsor alternative energy with government cash.
<p> Adding pressure to the argument is the lacklustre track record of the $5 billion invested in the domestic electric car industry. This is highlighted by reports that many taxpayer funded plants have recently idled or been shut due to low demand for this relatively pricy emerging technology.
<p> Looking at investor sentiment in the electric vehicle sector, we see high short interest in many of the companies involved in electric vehicle production and development.
<p> Pure play electic
<p> A123's demise was directly linked to weakening demand for the technology. Short sellers were fully aware of that fact with the company seeing over 15% of its shares out on loan prior to its bankruptcy filing. This number represented nearly all the available supply of shares in lending programs.
<p> The other three pure play electric car companies worldwide see similar bearish sentiment with high short interest.
<p> Tesla Motors, the company founded by Elon Musk, has received over $450 million in federal loans in order to get production of its electric vehicles up to speed.
<p> The stock has seen short interest recently hit an all time high of 25% of its total shares at the end of last month. Whilst short sellers have retreated slightly in the last months, the current short interest represents nearly 90% of available shares sitting in lending programs.
<p> The company is forecasted to continue its loss making streak for the seventh year running after missing its original revenue target by a third for the 2012 fiscal year.
<p> The other major electric car company is Hong Kong listed BYD, which also sees high short interest. The company has seen demand to borrow jump 13% in the last three months to 7.5% of shares.
<p> Component firms
<p> Component firms also see high short interest as the supply chain for electric cars feel the pinch brought on by the lack of demand for the technology.
<p> Polypore whose membranes make up three quarters of revenue, has seen short interest jump to over 30% of shares in the last year.
<p> Fellow component firm Maxwell Technologies also sees above average short interest with 6% of shares out on loan. This number is down from 16% seen in April when the company saw its share price decline by a third following disappointing earnings.
<p> Mass market appeal?
<p> Perhaps the most disappointed investors from the lack of demand for electric cars are those investors in conventional car companies who had banked on a broader uptake of electric cars.
<p> GM expected to sell around a third of the 60,000 Chevrolet Volts it forecasted at the start of the year. The company has seen short interest jump by over 30% in the last three months to 2.7% of shares.
<p> This slow uptake will no doubt be of little comfort for the European car maker which had bet on electric cars to revive slowing sales.
<p> Investors in recently bailed out Peugeot will take little comfort from its Ion sales despite the company's strong position in the European electric car market. Peugeot's fortunes continue to be tainted by a deep lack of demand in its conventional markets.
