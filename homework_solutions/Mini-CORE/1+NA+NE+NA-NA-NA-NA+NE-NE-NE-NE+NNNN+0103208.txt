<p> Braben says in the new video : "This is a game we at Frontier have wanted to make for a long time. Certainly it's a game that I've wanted to make myself for a long time.
<p> "I thoroughly enjoyed making and playing the original Elite and the sequels. To recreate that magic is absolutely phenomenal and it looks like it's possible now. Thank you very much to those who have already pledged."
<p> Frontier, which in more recent years has worked closely with Microsoft developing games such as Kinectimals, has laid out a Kickstarter pledge and rewards policy here .
<p> "We're using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so," Braben said.

<p> @1 Do it, I am old enough to have played the original and the sequels in the 90's. They won't play well now but if modernised the depth and scope of the games were staggering and will now doubt become a modern masterpiece. I don't know how it will stack up to the likes of EVE online as I haven't got into that but rool on 2014!!
<p> Like Jock I remember being completely gobsmacked by this when it first came out. Whether a new version would stand up to modern gaming I'm not sure. But I'd happily invest to get it made if I hade any money to spare.
<p> I played the original Elite BBCB version and what a delight that was! Nothing beat the thrill of successfully running Narcotics or luxury items, goading Police at spacestations, skimming fuel off a sun or the horror of Ending up in Witch-Space I actually did earn Elite status after a ridiculous amount of play hours
<p> I never had a chance to try the later versions. CAN NOT WAIT for this!
<p> I have donated 40 to have my name used as an NPC name in the game Considering there were 10000 available, I presume its going to be a massive game.
<p> As soon as i heard this game was being made i pledged 50, You can get the game in digital download format for 20 but I gave more money as i really want this game to be made.
<p> Im 37 years old and i played the original Elite, Frontier and First Encounters, They are some of the best games i have ever played.
<p> I also have played games almost every single day since then till now and ive never been as excited as this for a game to be released.
<p> I also read the very first edition of C+VG in paper format and i still have many issues from the 1980's in my attic locked away, They may be worth a small fortune nowadays
<p> All i can say is some games deserve to be made and some dont, Elite: Dangerous does deserve to be made, all those games today and years ago like Wing commander,Privateer, Freespace, X3 series, EVE online......they are all Clones of Elite, Although they do what they do ok, There NOT Elite and they dont feel like Elite.
<p> I really really want this game to be made, If it gets the funding it could be one of the best games ever made,its on Kickstarter so David Braben has cut out the Publisher or the middleman which means he can design the game how he wants to design it just like he did in 1984-1993 and 1995.
<p> I really really hope it gets the funding because if it does it should be absolutely fantastic!!
<p> I first got into the Elite games with Frontier: Elite 2 way pack in 1993 and was quickly fascinated with the realistic cosmos it presented along with the truly epic scope of endless systems requiring exploration, the combat and the planetary landings. Then when First Encounters came out with its better looking planets, ships, better missions and the bulletins I was addicted again. I must have played those two games for years at a time or at least it seemed like that. I am over the moon that a new game has been announced and encourage everyone to find out what the Elite games were all about and why they are still considered the pinnacle of gaming design.
