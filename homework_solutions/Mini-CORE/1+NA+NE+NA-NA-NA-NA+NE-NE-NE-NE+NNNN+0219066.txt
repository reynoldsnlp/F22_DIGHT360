<p> Sex, Lies And Rinsing Guys star Danica Thrall became the fifth contestant to be evicted from the Celebrity Big brother house last night (August 31) and Entertainmentwise caught up with the CBB housemate earlier today to find out what it was like to be branded 'fake' and about life in general inside the house...
<p> Following her constant backstabbing and b***hiness in the house recently, it came as no real surprise when Danica exited the house to an array of boos, but she still managed to plaster a smile on her face.
<p> The reality star told us: "It's like going on a long holiday but is a bit more intense, I enjoyed the experience and had an amazing time."
<p> But, despite her reputation to 'rinse' guys, Damica insisted that she was 'very happy' with her boyfriend outside of the house, despite the fact that she was linked to The Situation AND Prince Lorenzo inside the CBB house.
<p> When we quizzed Danica about whether or not she would continue to 'rinse' guys, she said: "I will continue to keep my amazon list open and if people want to give me a gift or a gesture then they can."
<p> So that's a yes then? Really, despite the 'magazine work' and 'modelling' that you have lined up, Danica?
<p> We also caught up with journalist Samantha Brick, who exited to a fairly positive crowd despite going in as kind of a 'national hate figure'.
<p> The journo was quick to say that she 'doesn't understand girls like Danica who flaunt their body for attention'.
<p> She told us: "Danica is such an intelligent girl, she can do so much more than rinsing men. She did say she want to go into television and I told her that I launched Russell Brand and was happy to help, so we'll see if she takes me up on that offer."
<p> "Our morals are totally different. I love my husband far too much to straddle a man on a bed. I can't tell you how close she sat to some of these men and regularly pushed her breasts into their faces. She's a bright little bunny and didn't need to do that."
<p> Oh dear. Do you think people are right to hate on the lingerie model so much?
<p> CBB: Week One In Pictures
<p> Cheryl Ferguson and Julie Goodyear were the first to enter the house, and straight away were given a secret task by Big Brother! The soap actresses had to convince the other housemates they hated each other, with Cheryl telling MC Harvey that Julie had slept with her ex! Clearly their years of acting paid off as they managed to win the task! Wenn.com/Channel 5
