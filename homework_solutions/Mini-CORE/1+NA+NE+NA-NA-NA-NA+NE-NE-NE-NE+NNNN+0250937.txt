<p> Unfortunately the Council is required legally to investigate and act on complaints of this nature and not to do so puts them at risk of being accused of maladministration which can invoke financial penalties. However, once again it appears that the complainants have decided to take the cowardly way of complaining to the Council rather than knocking on a door to try to resole their concern in a calm and amicable manner.
<p> As a parent you do get used to noise, you don't have a choice really! But as a previous non-parent I would not even sit next to a table with kids at a restuarant! Noisy kids who do not belong to you are annoying. Ask anyone.
<p> dogs barking most of the day, while the owners are out is more annoying. you hardley hear children playing out nowadays, with health and safety. let them play during the day. was the person who complained never a child.
<p> In the first instance, you have to take up and issue like this with the persons in question. There's no need to resort to reporting to the Council straight off the bat. However, living next door to a single mother and her odious brat, I do sympathise. What might be acceptable levels of noise to one person are not neccessarily acceptable to another. Particularly the sounds of screaming kids...
<p> There's a big difference between children playing and children running wild, the latter having a significant impact on any neighbour. I used to live in a built-up area with a nursery school and a primary school within a few metres of my garden. The sound of the children playing was actually really lovely to hear. But then when I moved to the suburbs, my next-door neighbour's children made much more noise than the 2 schools put together -- always screaming and shouting at the top of their voices, and often from early in the morning till late at night -- and it had a major impact on my health. I did have a polite word with them, but to no avail. Again, it wasn't the 'normal' noise of kids 'playing' that was disturbing, but the contstant screaming, shouting and shrieking. No one should have to put up with that. Children are entitled to enjoy themselves, but it's the responsibility of those looking after them to ensure that they don't cause a disturbance to others while doing so.
<p> A council spokesman said: 'We have to investigate any noise complaints we receive and informed Mr and Mrs Lansdell a complaint had been received.' But the City Council have done no investigation whatsoever, merely sat on their collective overpaid, overbroad rumps and issued a standard anonymous threatening computer letter. The more amusing side is that considering Pie Eater Prescott is the local MP, complaining about childish noises is less than apposite. One would think that if a neighbour had a problem with the noise then, being a GOOD neighbour, (s)he would have had a chat with the little chap's mum before going to all the bother of writing t'Town 'All, happen, tha knows!
<p> Until we experienced a similar problem, I would have adopted the view that "children are noisy, they get excited when they play".. I like children, and especially like happy, playing ones. However - and it's a big however - we had neighbours whose children's noise went way beyond anything acceptable. The boy (7) would run up and down the garden for hours making fire engine siren noises at full volume. The girl (5) would stand and scream hysterically until it became uncontrollable (it sounded like an adult woman being murdered). Their mother found it all highly amusing, despite us and others politely raising the issue repeatedly. She simply refused to discipline or control them. Our final measure was to report it as anti-social behaviour - very much a last resort - but the official intervention did the trick. I suspect something similar has happened in the situation described in this article.
