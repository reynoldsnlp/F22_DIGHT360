<h> Product Description
<h> From the Studio
<p> Brendan Fraser stars in this action-packed adventure based on the Jules Verne classic that is sure to deliver fun for the whole family! On a hunch to find the center of the earth, Trevor Anderson (Fraser), his nephew and their tour guide make a breakthrough discovery that launches them on a thrilling journey into the unknown. On a scamble to find their way back, the group travels through a never-before-seen world, encountering creatures and objects never imagined.
<p> While on a hastily arranged expedition to Iceland to retrieve data from a previously dormant volcanic sensor gadget, the trio emulates Alice by falling down a hole. Curiouser and curiouser, they end up not in Wonderland, but in a lost world, where long-extinct phosphorescent birds flutter by and the flying fish have a serious case of overbite.
<p> Using the storyline of a missing brother and misunderstood Vernian volcanologists, the little group wanders around the treacherous terrain, overcoming insurmountable odds and horrible hardship (Eat your Trilobite, Sean) before reaching the grandly preposterous finale.
<p> This movie isn't blockbuster materiel and the 3D was one of the primary reasons for obtaining it. Unfortunately the 3D rendition, at least as seen on an LCD flat panel, was quite poor. There is a lot of ghosting and many double images.
<p> The 3D was so poor that it became a distraction and we ended up watching in regular 2D. If they hadn't included the 2D version I would have retuned the disks.
<p> I'm not sure that Jules Verne, who was a stickler for scientific detail - be it imaginary or real - would think too highly of this film, even though it's not a true adaptation of his original novel. In this cinematic world, scientific fact is the equivalent of a prize greased pig - everyone keeps chasing it, but no one ever catches it. If you're going to throw realism to the curb, though, you might as well do it in unabashed grand style - and that is precisely what you get in this 21st century Journey to the Center of the Earth. What you have here is your basic summer-time action comedy. These guys survive falls that Wile E. Coyote couldn't walk away from. Fortunately, the whole thing is entertaining enough to overcome all of the inanities that could otherwise have doomed this film into forgettable silliness. In other words, it's a Brendan Fraser movie. Every time I see Brendan Fraser in a movie, my immediate reaction is to say uh oh and expect the worst - yet every time I actually end up feeling entertained. That's not to say this is a good movie - it's more of what I call a "good enough" movie.
<p> Fraser plays Trevor Anderson, a volcanologist dedicated to continuing his late older brother's studies. Max apparently got himself killed searching for the lost world described in Verne's novel, believing that the father of science fiction was describing fact and not fantasy. Just when his lab is stolen out from under him and all seems to be lost, a 10-day visit with Max's son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) brings with it new clues in the form of notes inside Max's copy of Verne's novel - and this leads uncle and nephew to discover a new site in Iceland they simply have to explore. The scientist they want to check with in Iceland turns out to be dead, but his hot redheaded daughter Hannah (Anita Briem) agrees to guide the two up the mountain to the site. Of course, they end up trapped by a cave-in and forced to explore the mountain cave system in search of an exit. They find a lot more than that, though.
<p> The film's myriad of CGI effects aren't all that impressive in 2D, but I'm sure the 3-D version must pack much more of a punch. Either way, though, I was surprised at how few "prehistoric" creatures there were on display. For example, I expected to see people running from dinosaurs all over the place, but there's basically just one giant monster to be found here. The characters' falls are worth watching, though, especially the first big one. If there's a longer falling scene in any other movie, I haven't come across it yet. A roller coaster-like ride in an old mine system is also great fun to watch - and the adventure doesn't end there. Some critic said this film was made as if it were a theme park ride, and I think that sums the whole thing up quite well.
