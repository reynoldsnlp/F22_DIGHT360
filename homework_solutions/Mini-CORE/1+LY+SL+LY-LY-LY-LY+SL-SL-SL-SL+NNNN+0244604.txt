<h> If You Want Lyrics
<h> Depeche Mode
<p> Working week's come to its end party time is here again Everyone can come if they want to If you want to be with me, if you want to be with me You can come with me if you want to Exercise your basic rights we could build a building site From the bricks of shame is built the hope If you want to be with me, if you want to be with me Even though you may still not want to Let tomorrow and today bring a life of ecstasy Wipe away your tears of confusion If you want to be with me, if you want to be with me You can come with me if you want to Even though you may still not want to
