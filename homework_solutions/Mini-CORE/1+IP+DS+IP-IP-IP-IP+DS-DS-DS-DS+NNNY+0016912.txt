<h> Synopsis
<p> Loopiethotamus is a Chihuahua who really does think he is a hippopotamus. When he was left by his biological mother in the meadow, he was a little puppy. That same night that he was left there, Mama Hippopotamus found him and took him home to live with her and her family. Mama Hippopotamus didnt want Loopiethotamus to feel left out or as though he was not a part of the family so she sewed him a hippopotamus suit to wear. The next day she put it on him and hes been wearing it ever since. Anytime that he happens to look in the mirror, he does not see the Chihuahua that he really is. He sees a hippopotamus, even though his face is not inside of the suit. He has to be able to see where hes going, right?Loopiethotamus goes through many different situations on a day to day basis. Imagine living in a suit that is way too big for you? Sometimes the kids in the neighborhood tease him. They tell him he is adopted, but he chooses not to let them know that those comments hurt him.
