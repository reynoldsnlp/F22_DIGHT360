<h> This Kind of Love Lyrics
<h> Eva Avila
<p> Woke up to find myself Standing in another day Filled with anxiety And praying for a different way I give it all I have Till I have no more to give I used to think I'd die for love Now I'd rather live If everywhere you look You'd find some misery The view from there can make You feel just a little crazy This kind of love ain't right Won't take us through the night Some think love equals pain but This kind of love's not true Not good for me or you I think we got to get out of this rain Sleep walking through life Waiting for the other shoe to fall Dreams cut like a knife When you think you shouldn't dream at all I saw a dark cloud Looks like it follows us around And it doesn't take that much you know To make it tumble down How did we ever go from being so happy To suffer along and be strong Just so we can keep on keeping on? If everywhere you look You'll find some misery The view from there can make You feel just a little crazy
