<h> Book Description
<p> Release Date: February 14, 2012
<p> The Way We Live... series of books focus on environments and styles of living that are parallel around the world yet somehow stylistically distinct in particular locations. This latest addition to the series celebrates country living, from the lavender fields of Provence and woodsy English cottages to Montana weekend ranches and Mexico's traditional adobe haciendas. Among the interiors and homes depicted here, there is sure to be inspiration aplenty for anyone daydreaming of rustic, yet stylish, country living.
<p> Traditional and contemporary styles are explored: an airy, minimalist sitting room looks out on to lush countryside; bunches of herbs and antique tools hang from rough-hewed beams beside a roaring log fire; an intricate stone floor shines through the sleek glass top of a contemporary dining table, where a bowl of fruit from the local farmers' market awaits guests.
<p> The concluding section of the book is a rich sequence of images of the best that life in the country has to offer, from colonial New England farmsteads to life aboard houseboats in Pacific Northwest fishing hamlets. This is inspirational, aspirational lifestyle photography at its finest.

<h> About the Author
<p> Stafford Cliff was formerly creative director at the Conran Design Group in London. The late Gilles de Chabaneix was one of France's most prominent photographers of interiors, whose work appeared in leading style magazines, including Elle Dcor and Marie Claire . Previous volumes in the series include The Way We Live by the Sea, The Way We Live in the City, The Way We Live with Color, and The Way We Live with the Things We Love .
<p> This book has been enjoyed by many people this summer, as it has been displayed on the coffee table for all to look at. Anyone who lives in the "country" will relate to it. The photographs are beautiful, and thumbing through the book is a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon!!!
<p> The introduction was GREAT. That was IT. NO MORE writing.....all pictures and captions. I buy books because I love to READ. I love to read about the 'way we live in the country' If you enjoy reading, don't waste your money. If you enjoy looking at beautiful pictures you will like the book. Most of the houses featured were outside of the US. I like reading about MY country.
