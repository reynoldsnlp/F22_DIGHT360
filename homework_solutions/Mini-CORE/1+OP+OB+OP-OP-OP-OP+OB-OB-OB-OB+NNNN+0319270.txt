<p> I've never heard the term "pinkwashing" before, but there it is in an Agence France-Press article called Canada touted as 'safe haven' for Iranian gays . The term is used by some in response to Immigration Minister Jason Kenney's recent campaign, i.e. his "mass email to Canadian gays and lesbians singing the praises of Ottawa's policies supportive of LGBT rights as well as women's rights."
<p> The AFP article says that the larger "LGBT community" (read: gays and lesbians) denounced (Kenney's) "recent campaign" as "a poor attempt at 'pinkwashing' the Conservative government's obvious desire to encourage war with Iran."
<p> As you may recall, Canada has been granting refugee status to gay people from Iran, welcoming about 100 a year, according to the AFP report.
<p> So, there is a new term for my vocabulary: pinkwashing.
<p> I'm not sure why the colour pink is associated with gay people. But I'm sure there is a good reason, yes?
<p> I do know, though, that when it comes to clothes, pink is one of my fave colours.
<p> P.S. I'm not going to comment on the "war" aspect of all this, except to quote the great Marvin Gaye's song, What's Going On:
