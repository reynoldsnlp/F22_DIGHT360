<p> We made sixty pancakes, ate about six. We played ten games of pick-up sticks, Counts cars on Route 66, but there's nothing much to do. We played four games of checkers, three games of chess, two of Monopoly, more or less. We tried to be neat. We made quite a mess. Now there's nothing much to do!
<p> Chorus: Nothing to do. Nothing to do. Nothing to do. Nothing to do. Nothing to do. Nothing really, Nothing to do. We played in the house, played in the grass. I played teacher, I barely passed. Listened to some music. That was pretty cool, but there's nothing much to do! We ate two fat bananas, a thin piece of cheese. An apple to crunch. An orange to squeeze. Got a milk moustache, which you wiped on your sleeve. Talk about nothing much to do.
<p> Chorus
<p> We've already done bout a hundred and twenty-one of our favorite fun things to do. But we won't be satisfied, remotely satisfied, til we find number one twenty-two.
