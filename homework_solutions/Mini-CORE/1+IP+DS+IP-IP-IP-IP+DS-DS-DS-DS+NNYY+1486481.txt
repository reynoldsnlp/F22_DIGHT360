<h> Synopsis
<p> A "Sunday Times" top-ten title in 2008 and a bestseller ever since, "I Used to Know That" has continued to delight readers with its pages of forgotten facts from our school days. Now available in paperback, this great gift book has been repackaged with a fresh jacket design for anyone new to the series, and old fans alike. Nostalgic, informative and entertaining, it is an ideal and accessible buy for adults wanting to brush up on their lost knowledge. If you've forgotten the capital city of Chile; the basics of osmosis; how to solve a quadratic equation; who wrote the famous poem about daffodils; and, the use of a conjunction or the number of continents in the world, "I Used to Know That" is guaranteed to provide all the answers.
