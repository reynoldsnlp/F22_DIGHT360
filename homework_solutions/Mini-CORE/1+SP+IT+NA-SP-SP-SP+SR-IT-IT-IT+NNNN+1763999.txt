<h> BLACK STICK DOES IT FOR PALMY
<p> Yvette Morrissey talks to the Black Sticks' top scorer at the Olympic Games, Nick Wilson, about the highs and lows of  London
<p> MASSIVE: What are you studying?
<p> NICK WILSON: A BBS (bachelor of business studies) majoring in finance and property.
<p> M: Tell us about your time in London?
<p> NW: It was awesome. It was my first time at the Olympics, and it was a really great atmosphere. London did a great job in organising it. It was a great experience off the field. The only thing over-riding it was our performance. That took away from it a bit, but looking back, the experience was amazing.
<p> M: Do you ever get sick of training every day?
<p> NW: I love training -- it's just like anyone else who loves their job and it's my passion. You know that it's all worth something too. You're going to the biggest show on Earth and you've got to be at your best. I find that my Massey work keeps me fresh. It can be quite hectic both training and study.
<p> M: Did the Kiwis party harder than anyone else in London?
<p> NW: The village got louder and louder as everyone finished their events. Our games were right throughout so we had to sleep well and couldn't go out and party until the end. When we finished we partied for about four nights. It was really good to let your hair out.
<p> M: How did you feel you guys performed in London?
<p> NW: I was quite happy with my performance individually, but it doesn't matter because the team didn't perform so well and that overrides everything. I was really disappointed. We came in seventh in the world [championships] and anything below that is a disappointment. We were hoping to get in the top 6. There were a number of things [that went wrong], but for me I feel we didn't play as a team.
<p> M: You guys tied with Germany (the gold medalists) in one of your pool matches. What was going through your mind the last 10 minutes of that game?
<p> NW: We had to win by five goals to get into the fifth and sixth playoffs, so there was a lot to play for. We were trying to go forward as much as possible, but that was the story of the tournament. We had patches where people were trying to do things they shouldn't have. We seemed like we were going in different directions. It's hard to remember what happened.
<p> M: The woman's team did quite well in London. If you guys were to play them, who would win?
<p> NW: Definitely us [laughs].
<p> M: What do you think of team mate Phil Burrows making one of the Mirror's hottest athletes of the Olympic Games?
<p> NW: Good for him. I don't know who voted for it ... he's single so he'll probably enjoy that exposure!
<p> M: How was the Opening Ceremony?
<p> NW: It was one of the best things about the Olympics for me. You walked out and there was about 50,000 to 80,000 people cheering for New Zealand. It's hard to describe, but I couldn't stop smiling the whole time.
<p> M: Did you meet any famous?
<p> NW: I talked to Kobe Bryant and I asked him to say "This is for Palmy" on camera, and he did.
<p> M: That's awesome!
<p> NW: It's a pretty cool video.
<p> M: Who was your favorite athlete at the games?
<p> NW: Probably Lisa Carrington. She's awesome to watch in the gym. She's so strong and lifts more weights than us.
<p> M: What's next for the Black Sticks?
<p> NW: We have the Champions Trophy in Melbourne in December. Our coach said he will probably still be involved, but not as a head coach, so a new coach will potentially come in. That transition will be interesting. About 12 of us will be playing hockey in the Netherlands soon.
