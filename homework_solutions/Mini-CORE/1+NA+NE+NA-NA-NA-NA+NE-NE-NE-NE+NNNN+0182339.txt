<p> LESS COURT: A report says less cases are being seen in court, but police say it doesn't mean less crime is happening in the region. Mike Knott
<p> AN ANNUAL report on the state of Queensland courts has shown a reduction in the number of defendants and charges coming before Bundaberg courts.
<p> But top cop Superintendent Rowan Bond says Bundy police certainly haven't seen a drop in the number of people committing offences and that the figures don't necessarily reflect a drop in crime.
<p> The Magistrates Court of Queensland Annual Report for the 2011-12 period shows 3558 adult defendants faced Bundaberg Magistrates Court on 5860 charges while 215 juvenile defendants faced the court during that time on 439 charges.
<p> The figures are lower than 2010-11 period when 3790 defendants faced court on 6287 charges and 311 children appeared on 547 charges.
<p> "We haven't seen any dramatic drops in people doing the wrong thing," Supt Bond said.
<p> "We've actually got slightly more drink drivers and we've got more breaks and more unlawful uses."
<p> Supt Bond said the decrease in court figures could have come about because more people were being trained to deal with liquor offences.
<p> "Once they've been trained they can hand out liquor offence notices so people might be getting tickets instead of being placed before the courts," Supt Bond said.
<p> "We've got areas that have shown increases and areas that have shown decreases."
<p> Supt Bond said many crimes were addressed through infringement notices and drug diversion rather than by the courts.
<p> The court report showed 494 domestic violence applications were made in the 2011-2012 period, 78 less than the 2010-2011 period.
<p> In addition, 387 protection orders were made in the 2011-2012 period compared to 457 the year before.
<p> "Domestic violence is an issue we take very seriously," Supt Bond said.
<p> "There are some people in the Bundaberg community who I don't know what we need to do to spread the word to that domestic violence isn't tolerated."
<p> The court reports also revealed 47 child protection orders were made in 2011-2012 compared to 63 the year before.
<p> There were just two more defendants lodged in the Bundaberg Supreme Court this year than the year before with 18 in 2011-2012 and 16 in 2010-2011.
<p> The District Court had a significant increase in the number of defendants lodged with 83 this year compared to 44 in 2010-2011.
