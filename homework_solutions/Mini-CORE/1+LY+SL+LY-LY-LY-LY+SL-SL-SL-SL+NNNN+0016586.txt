<h> Yentl This Is One Of Those Moments lyrics
<p> (She joins a group of students on their way to a Yeshiva in Bechv where she is tested by the Rabbi. He is impressed with Yentl's knowledge and admits "him" as a student.)
<p> There are moments you remember all your life. There are moments you wait for ans1 dream, Of all your life. This is one of those moments. I will always remember this chair, that window, the way the light streams in. The clothes I'm wearing, The words I'm heating, The face I'm seeing, The feeling I'm feeling, The smell, the sounds, will be written On my mind, will be written in my heart As long as I live! I can, travel the past and take what I need To see me through the years What my father learned and his Father before him will be there For my eyes and ears. I can walk through the forests Of the trees of knowledge And listen to the lessons of the leaves. I can enter rooms Were there are rooms within rooms Wrapped in the shawl that learning weaves. I remember, Papa-everything you taught me What you gave me, Papa- Look at what it's brought me There are certain things that once you have No man can take away- No wave can wash away- No wind can blow away- And now they're about to be mine! No tide can turn away- No fire can burn away- No time can wear away... I can open doors and take from the shelves All the books I've longed to hold I can ask all the questions, The whys and the wheres As the mysteries of life unfold Like a link in a chain From the past to the future That joins me with the children yet to be, I can now be a part Of the ongoing stream, That has always been a part of me! There are certain things that once you have No man can rake away- No wave can wash away- No wind can blow away- No tide can turn away- No fire can burn away- No time can wear away- And now they're about to be mine! There are moments you remember all your life. There are moments you wait for And dream, of all your life. This is one of those moments!
