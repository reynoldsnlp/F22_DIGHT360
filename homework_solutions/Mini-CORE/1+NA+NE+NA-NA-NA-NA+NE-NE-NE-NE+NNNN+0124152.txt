<h> 'I am back!': One Direction's Zayn Malik returns to tweet fans just two days after quitting Twitter
<p> Price of fame: Zayn Malik has returned to Twitter 48 hours after quitting it
<p> After amassing over five million followers Zayn Malik quit Twitter, and then rejoined again 48 hours later.
<p> The One Direction star apologised to his fans for leaving them after making the dramatic u-turn.
<p> He said: 'Sorry, I was getting some abuse on twitter but I dont want to let my fans down. So I am back!! :) x'.
<p> The news was instantly greeted by followers thanking him and praising the singer for returning to the social network site.
<p> He later tweeted: 'And thanks for all your messages of support. I really do love all you guys, your support never ceases 2 amaze me xxx.'
<p> The 19-year-old sensationally said goodbye to the social network site after getting fed up with people posting abusive messages.
<p> He sent what was supposed to be his final tweet on Tuesday, and said: 'The reason i don't tweet as much as i use to, is because I'm sick of all the useless opinions and hate that i get daily goodbye twitter :)'.
<p> However, Zayn promised to not completely cut all communication with his legion of admirers and added: 'My fans that have something nice to say can tweet me on the one direction account , :) x'.
<p> Despite informing the world that they could still send messages to the One Direction page, his supporters inundated him with messages begging him to reconsider.
<p> The topics #ComeBackZayn and #ZaynComeBack even began trending after hysterical girls pleaded with him to stay on the site.
<p> Look who's back: Zayn claims he returned to Twitter for his real fans
<p> Their positive words obviously worked as the pop star came back to the site and vowed never to quit it again.
<p> The singer, who recently added a blonde highlight to his quiff, became incensed with users claiming his relationship with Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards was fake.
<p> Some people even accused Zayn of cheating on the reigning X Factor winner.
<p> Had enough: Zayn, pictured on Monday, is sick of people posting negative comments about him
<p> He explained to friends on social messenger Kik: 'Don't worry about me, im fine. I just deleted my account because of all the hate i was getting just by tweeting something simple.
<p> 'And all the rumours of me smoking weed and cheating. I dont need to read any of that negativity.'
<p> A source close to Zayn said: 'They couldn't be happier, it's ridiculous that anyone thinks otherwise.
<p> 'When they're together it's like excited teenagers getting together for the first time.'
<p> Within minutes of reactivating his account Zayn directed attention to his bands new single and tweeted: '@onedirection: Here it is...The #1DBigAnnoucement from the boys!! Watch it now to check out their MASSIVE news!! 1DHQ x'.
<p> The news that the boys are releasing a single doesn't seem that exciting or groundbreaking considering making music is their job.
<p> Negativity is frustrating to deal with specially on a daily, hes still gettin use it but just has to be ignored not to be fueled up. There Will always be rumors, haters out there its a part of that rollercoaster called life. Still luv zaynnn
<p> Ah boo hoo! Get over yourself you pathetic drama queen. Everyone gets hate or suffers in life so why should everyone suddenly stop what they are doing for a boyband cry baby? He should grateful for the attention he gets because if we wasn't in a tweeny boyband no one would be interested in him. Grow up and develop a back bone!
<p> He's the hottest one in the band. They're all good looking but he and sometimes Liam are the only 'sexy' ones, probably because they're both more mature acting. - Tamsin, London, 23/8/2012 23:48 - Honey, this boy band is never mature acting and thats coming from a massive directioner :p
