<h> There has been a huge awakening -- Kiran Bedi
<p> India's first and highest ranking woman police officer, Dr Kiran Bedi is also a senior team member of Anna Hazare. She spoke to Indian Herald, Editor, Rohit Revo during her visit to Sydney. Excerpts.
<p> It has been said that you are the only gainer in the fight between Anna and Kejriwal?
<p> Gainer? In what way? I never did it for any gain or loss. I did it only because that's the right thing to do. I wish to continue to raise social consciousness and make people feel responsible for their citizenship and earn it actually, but in return want nothing. I feel I get everything when my country gets better, becomes better and better. That's my reward. So, there's nothing towards gain.
<p> When you started IAC movement, two years back, you just then came up with a bang. Do you think you have made a change in the way people now think in India?
<p> India's gone through a whole lot of change last two years. So much of exposure of our anti-corruption has not happened before, and that's the result of too many things. Certainly, India Against Corruption movement, plus Right to Information by citizens, plus media breaking news. The acts of blatant corruption, which happened, have got exposed. So, I have noticed last two years has been a huge awakening. I think what never happened 58 years before has happened during the last two years.
<p> There has been a huge awakening.
<p> You said rightly that corruption cases are now out in the open, but do you think the judiciary is ready to offer punishment to all of these people or do you think we need changes in judiciary?
<p> This country is desperately in need of judicial reforms. The biggest bane of Indian judiciary today is its traffic jam. And also about its growth, its own transparency, judicial use of more and more of IT in the judiciary, it's more internal reforms, internal reforms within judiciary. Secondly, more transparency, expeditious justice.
<p> This morning I attended one of the drug courts. What an interesting way of crime prevention as rehabilitation. Now, these innovative methods need to come to Indian judiciary. You might just say this might need legislation. There can be many, many innovative ways where the judges can do an application of law. So, what I'm saying is Indian judiciary is independent. It comes up with remarkable judgments. And it's deeply still respected in the Indian psyche. But for a common man, it is expensive, it is grossly delayed, and even at some times probably suspect in some ways. And judiciary is under no ombudsman at the moment. It's only under its own ombudsman. So, a lot of judiciary reforms is needed in this country, though the judgments the judiciary gives, whenever it does, are absolutely respected.
<p> You got support of so many people in India, but are you satisfied with the support you got from NRIs all over the world or do you think there's more to be done?
<p> I think plenty of support came to us. It's too early to assess how much it came because we hardly had any time to really assess the amount of support we got. But it was amazing. It was across the board whether it was in the United States or United Kingdom or UAE.
<p> We had some of the protests in Australia as well?
<p> What now needs to be done is to consolidate and link that with the network. I already have a Web site of Non-resident Indians Against Corruption (nriac.org). Anna's movement is being reorganized. We will try and link them all with their own databases, their own sites.
<p> Like Indians in Sydney against corruption. What I'm planning to do is group them together and link them so that they continue to remain updated with what we are doing
<p> Anna is expanding his advising group. On 24 -- 30 th of November, we are meeting Anna in in his city Ralegoan Siddhi. He's expanding his group. So, all that is happening.
<p> They don't wait for media to tell them . The NRIs can go to the site and pick up information and become listed members of the site so they can even network with each other.
<p> How can ordinary people like me or anybody on the road fight corrupt politicians?
<p> Network. Not without networking -- all alone you can't. You have to form groups. You can all belong to different states and different religions. You may belong to different languages. But when it comes to certain causes, as communities, we need to come together. We must learn social responsibility and collective responsibility.
<p> I think we have been all to ourselves a lot. We do a lot of bhangra together, we may do garba together, we may do -- celebrate Diwali together, but when it comes to citizen responsibility, we also need to come together on certain issues. And anti-corruption, we must have a reason to come together, Indians in Australia together, Indians in America together. Even if there are lots of associations, when it comes to anti-corruption, they must come together.
<p> Non-resident Indians are already contributing to the strength of the Indian economy by repatriating a lot of valuable dollars, which pays all our petrol bills. I think it would add more for infrastructure.
<p> You started Navjyoti in 1986 and treating over 12,000 drug addicts. What has been your experience and how is the foundation going on now?
<p> I have two foundations: Navjyoti India Foundation and India Vision Foundation. Navjyoti India Foundation is today focusing on working with absolute underprivileged. It's been working for the underprivileged in slum schoolchildren education program, religious and woman empowerment, etc.
<p> Now, we are into a new program, Navjyoti, where people will be linked with business schools for the poor. It's like business schools for the underserved. You only hear of business school for the rich. Now, you will hear of this Navjyoti Business School for the marginalized. This has already started.
<p> And that is through community colleges where we are teaching skills. How can a woman who runs a parlor run her business better? How can a woman who sells vegetables run her business better? How can we ensure that she doesn't go to a loan shark and pay 20% interest? If she needs a loan, where should she go to? So, we are trying to now ensure the quality of shopkeeper, of retailer, a small plumber.
<p> How can he develop -- so, it's not literacy to skills; it's skills to literacy. So, this is our business school concept.
<p> There we are finding the right partners in Melbourne. In Sydney, we have individuals for India Vision Foundation where they sponsor a child each and I can link them a deserving child with prisoner's child for education, which is the concept to save the next victim. So, these are my two foundations. I hope to have Sydney as Indians and they can then continue to send volunteers who want to be linked so they can link the child. I can play the intermediary role between linkage of deserving child with their sponsor. And then Navjyoti would be in Melbourne where we set up the business schools, which would have partnership programs for syllabus degrees.
<p> If a degree can be for the middle class and the rich, why can't we degree for the poor?
<p> Did the numerous technologies like Twitter or Facebook, help transform your movement? Did it help?
<p> Absolutely. That really informed people and sent the message through SMS and others with amazing success. Our movement actually was an example -- experiment and example how networking can help people, and it did and it continues to do. One Twitter message I've been tweeting since morning and people have loved it. Australian Indians have connected with me through the Twitter, asking me questions. It is amazing. And I've been sending my observations about the drug court. I even sent a picture of magpie, as I was stepping into the drug court.
<p> And I shot that and sent it to people. People retweeted it to so many. So, magpie, drug, what NRIs think, what do they want. I've sent about 20 tweets since yesterday.
