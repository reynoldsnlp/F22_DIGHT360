<h> What Do You Got? lyrics
<h> Bon Jovi What Do You Got? lyrics
<p> Everybody wants something, just a little more We're making a living, and what we're living for A rich man or a poor man, a pawn or a king You can live on the street, you can rule the whole world But it don't mean one dang thing
<p> What do you got, if you ain't got love? Whatever you got, it just ain't enough You walk in the road, but you're going nowhere You're tryin' to find your way home, but there's no one there Who do you hold, in the dark of night? You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight You have all the things, that you've been dreaming of
<p> If you ain't got someone, you're afraid to lose Everybody needs just one, someone... to tell them the truth Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I still believe I believe in hope, I believe the change can get us up off our knees [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bon_j\\... ] What do you got, if you ain't got love? Whatever you got, it just ain't enough You walk in the road, but you're going nowhere You're tryin' to find your way home, but there's no one there Who do you hold, in the dark of night? You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight You have all the things, that you've been dreaming of
<p> If you ain't got love, it's all just keeping score If you ain't got love, what the hell we doing it for
<p> I don't wanna have to talk about it, How many songs you gotta sing about it? How long you gonna live without it? Why does someone somewhere have to doubt it? Someday we'll figure it out
<p> Solo
<p> What do you got, if you ain't got love? Whatever you got, it just ain't enough You walk in the road, but you're going nowhere You're tryin' to find your way home, but there's no one there Who do you hold, in the dark of night? You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight You have all the things, that you've been dreaming of
<p> If you ain't got love, it's all just keeping score If you ain't got love, what the hell we doing it for Woahhh, I ain't got, if you ain't got love Woahhh, What do you got if you ain't got love? Woahhh, What do you got if you ain't got love?
